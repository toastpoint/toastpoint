<h3>The Details</h3>
<h4>The Beginning</h4>
<img src=gifs/samp.jpg align=left alt="(Photo - Sam)">
<img src=gifs/mom&dad.jpg align=right alt="(Photo - Mom and Dad)">
I was born in Washington D.C. in 1964 and grew up in McLean, Virginia (a 
DC suburb) with my parents and older sister.  
That's Sam to the left, Mom and Dad to the right.   
Sam lives in North Carolina, Mom and Dad live in South Carolina, where they retired.<hr>
<h4>Schools</h4>
I went to 
<a href=http://www.wm.edu/>college in Williamsburg, </a> where I majored in Music and waffled between several minors before ending up with Psychology.  
<p>I then went to  
<a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">graduate school in Baltimore</a>, where 
I majored in horn performance and minored in voice.  
<hr><h4>OMG, I'm a Big Homo</h4>
Also, during my grad school years, I went through the terrifying and exhilarating 
process of coming out of the closet, which solved many problems and created almost none.  Since then, I've been proudly, if quietly out, figuring the best form of activism is simply to provide an example of a happy openly-gay man.
<hr><h4>The Philadelphia Years</h4>
I moved to Philly after grad school, figuring it was on the East Coast, but wasn't DC (where I grew up), Baltimore (which I was ready to leave) or New York (which I wasn't ready for yet).  I spent the rest of my twenties there starting my career as a computer geek, did a lot of community theater, played horn, sang semi-professional 
opera chorus, conducted Philly's gay band and had a variety of largely unsuccessful relationships.
<hr>
<h4>Leopold the Cat</h4>
<img src=gifs/leopold.jpg align="right">In 1991, I adopted a huge black fluffy thing named Leopold.  Mr. Leo was only a ten-month old kitten when his first owner - a friend of several friends of mine - passed away suddenly.  Mr. Leo was my neurotic, evil, gorgeous and much loved boy for fifteen wonderful years, until we lost him to various illnesses in May, 2006.

<hr><h4>It's a Wonderful Town</h4>
In 1994, literally on my 30th birthday, I moved to Manhattan and instantly my life became 
much more stimulating.  Although many people warned me about the perils of 
New York City, it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be.
<hr><h4>The Wumpus</h4>
Four months later, after ten years of unsuccessful relationships, I met <a href=wumpus.html>the 
most wonderful man in the world</a>.  Six months later, we set up household in historic <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights>Jackson Heights, Queens</a>.  After over a decade, we're still there and still going strong.
<hr><h4>Work</h4>
During grad school, I discovered how easy it was to earn money knowing just a little bit about computers.  I did word-processing and other computer stuff for a Baltimore law firm part-time.  Once in Philadelphia, I started doing tech support and eventually training.  I managed to weed out the tech support (hurrah!) and segue into technical writing.  Now I'm still mostly a tech writer, but I do a lot of business analysis and quality assurance (software).  I've been in the same job for over a decade: everyone I work with is in another city so I am a "remote worker" and have the delightful setup of having an office <i>and</i> being able to work from home whenever I want.
<hr><h4>Performing</h4>
Although I never attempted to go pro after grad school, I've always been performing in one way or another.  Acting, musical-directing, band directing, opera chorus, chamber music, a whole bunch of stuff.  I spent my first few years in NYC playing horn with a woodwind quintet, and performing on and off with the 
<a href=http://www.lgbac.org>
Lesbian and Gay Big Apple Corps</a> band, the sister band to the one I conducted 
in Philadelphia.  In '98, very suddenly, I became the BAC's artistic director and spent over seven years in that job, conducting over twenty concerts and leading the band in its <a href=prideforallages.html>Carnegie Hall debut</a>.  Band took up all my time until I stepped down on <a href=prideandjoy.html>Maestro Eric Peterson Day</a>, seven years later.  
<p>
Although I love doing theater in general, and the Wumpus and I see Broadway shows frequently, I have a particular 
interest in Gilbert and Sullivan.  My membership in <a href=http://www.concentric.net/~Oakapple/savoynet/>Savoynet</a> 
has given me many opportunities to participate in gatherings of other G&S fans and to sing many roles in 
concert.  The summer of 2003, I had the amazing experience of performing the role of Phantis in Savoynet's 
production of <i>Utopia, Ltd.</i> at the 
International Gilbert & Sullivan Festival in Buxton, England.  I've been back to the festival twice since: as a chorister in the <a href=http://www.toastpoint.com/travel/buxton2006.html>2006 Ruddygore</a> and as rehearsal pianist for the <a href=http://www.savoynet.org/Buxton2007/>2007 HMS Pinafore</a>.
<p>
Since retiring from the band, I've returned to the theater, hurrah.  I joined <a href=http://members.aol.com/bartsweb/>St. Bart's Players</a> for their <a href=http://members.aol.com/bartsweb/shows/lnmusic.htm>2006 A Little Night Music</a> and become a <a href=http://www.bht.org>Blue Hill Trouper</a>.  The BHT has given me some fabulous opportunities, including my first staged <i>Yeomen</i> and music-directing their 2007 <a href=http://www.bht.org/mame.php3>Mame</a>.

<h4>Online Haunts</h4>
Online, I tend to hang out at online forums such as <a href=http://www.worldcrossing.com>World Crossing</a>.  I have also 
joined the blogging multitudes by keeping a <a href=http://stanharding.livejournal.com>LiveJournal</a>.
