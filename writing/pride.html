<h2>PRIDE AND PREJUDICE</h2>
<p>
<h5><strong>Au Courant</strong> - September, 1990</h5>
<p>     A recent phone call got me into a discussion about last
year's gay pride parade in Philadelphia, and pride events in
general.  I happily began expounding my Pride Day Theory, which
runs somewhat thus: No matter how closeted you are, or how
uninvolved you are in the gay community as a rule, you should
show up to Pride Day events.  You don't have to march, you don't
have to wear drag, you can even hide behind dark glasses if
you're scared someone will identify you.  But just being there
adds another number to the head count, and as we all know, the
problem has always been just to get the society at large to
realize how many of us there are.  The more people attend gay
pride functions, the better it is for our cause - so just by
showing up, you can help your community!
<p>     Well, my friend flustered me by going off on a tangent -
his
theory (supported by his recently-read copy of After the Ball)
was that more people would come to gay pride functions if the
parades didn't feature groups that offend people.  The biggest
case in point was groups like NAMBLA, but he also referred to S&M
groups and even Dykes on Bikes.  "Eric, don't you think we'd be
accepted more if we didn't invite offensive groups like that?  I
mean, do you really want those boy-lovers leading off the
parade?"  Well, no, but that's not the point.
<p>     First of all, let me make clear that you can put me on the
conservative end of the gay spectrum when it comes to off-the-
wall behavior.  Other than my basic orientation in the "wrong"
direction, there's nothing unusual about my likes and dislikes in
regard to sexual behavior.  Admittedly, I have my specific
preferences in regard to romantic partners, as does everyone I've
ever met.  But you don't find me jello-wrestling or shrimping or
shaving any part of my body except my face.  But before the
jello-wrestlers get all upset, let me say that I don't find any
of that unpleasant or sick or repulsive - they're just not
activities I have any desire to do.
<p>     But I must say it took me a hell of a long time to come to
terms with S&M.  Back when I thought S&M was just sickies
whipping each other, I found it silly and irrelevant.  I heard my
lovers speak of the fine line between pleasure and pain, but
nothing registered.  Pain has nothing to do with my particular
sexual desires - either giving or receiving - and as far as I'm
concerned, that fine line is a brick wall.  But as I grew older
and, if not wiser, at least more experienced, I added to my
circle of friends men who were active in the S&M scene, or who at
least dabbled in it.  When the subject came up, I asked a lot of
questions and gained a fuller comprehension of the particulars of
the scene - the power relationships, the punishment and reward
and the fantasy roles.  Rather than enlighten me and add to my
understanding, this new information freaked me out and I actively
disdained S&M activities.  I lightened up a bit when I realized
that S&M sex is consensual - both partners want it, each embraces
his particular role and all limits and repertoire is decided
before the actual scene.  So what perhaps was the REAL fear -
finding myself unwittingly in an S&M scene - dissipated when I
realized that most S&M enthusiasts don't force a scene on anyone
(unless of course, that is the signal that the person is sending
out - and I guess that's all part of the language of the initial
meeting).  Yes, there are assholes out there who will suddenly
pull domination games on you in bed without previous agreement,
but they're not the norm.  EVERY scene has its abusers, and you
can't condemn a lifestyle because of someone not playing by the
rules.
<p>     Another intellectual discussion was the catalyst for
finally
coming to terms with S&M.  The friend I was talking with felt the
same way as I did (leery of the whole thing), but listening to
him voice my viewpoint put things in perspective.  When John said
"You know, I having nothing against them, but I don't understand
it and I don't want to see it, and I don't want them doing it
around me!", it sounded real familiar.  And I said, "You know,
John, you sound just like a straight person talking about
homosexuality, instead of a gay person talking about S&M!".  The
exact same feelings, the exact same words.  And I realized that
my attitudes towards a scene that I had no interest in and had no
effect on me were about as valid as a straight person's disdain
of homosexuality.
<p>     It really comes down to this - gay liberation is not about
the freedom for men to sleep with men and women to sleep with
women.  It is about Personal Freedom, period.  Personal Freedom
implies the freedom for a person to do ANYTHING with a consensual
partner, be it normal boring sex, or jello-wrestling or bondage
or anything.  Or not have sex at all. If we fight for personal
freedom, we can't limit it to what we personally are interested
in.  
<p>     "But does that mean we give the people the freedom to rob,
or murder other people?  Isn't depriving them of those rights
curtailing their personal freedom?"  Well, obviously the line has
to be drawn.  Notice the word "consensual" I've used.  We are a
society and society is basically people establishing rules so we
don't kill each other.  Personal freedom means the freedom to do
anything as long as it affects no one else, or if it affects
others, with their full consent.  In other words, I can jello-
wrestle with my partner only if he is willing.  If he says no, I
don't have the right to force him.  This carries over to S&M - if
Mr. S wants to tie up Mr. M and whip him, and Mr. M wants Mr. S
to tie him up and be whipped, what's wrong with letting them do
it?  It affects no one else, and both parties are agreeable. 
However, if Mr. S wants to tie me up, well, I would say no and
then try to persuade him to join me in something more to both our
tastes.  The consensuality is the important thing.
<p>     Having come to terms with S&M, I still have problems with
NAMBLA and their reason for existing.  The problem with the
consensuality theory here is we usually think of "consenting
adults".  The North American Man/Boy Love Association maintains
that the underage partners in their relationship are consenting. 
But legally, being children, they are not responsible for them-

selves and are considered to be not ready to handle a sexual
relationship.  Probably the point could be made that some
children are able to handle a sexual relationship and some
cannot.  I see this as similar to alcohol and its regulation -
while some children could handle alcohol and some could not, it
is best to limit the sale of alcohol to people who are legally
responsible for themselves.  The same argument could stand for
sexual relationships.
<p>       However, keeping the status quo on sex with underaged
partners does not help out the NAMBLA members.  They obviously
have as strong a sexual drive as anyone else, and nowhere legal
to vent it.  I see them as being in the same situation as the
whole gay community before Stonewall.  As much as society would
like them to change their sexual drive to something more
"appropriate", I'm sure that's just as impossible as changing
from gay to straight.  So what are they supposed to do?  I
unfortunately do not have an answer to this, but since I am not a
trained psychiatrist and have never done research on this
subject, I will have to take the views I have heard as correct
and view a sexual relationship as unhealthy for a child.
<p>     But to answer my friend's question about Gay Pride Day
Parades, yes, leather groups and Radical Faeries and, yes, even
NAMBLA have just as much right to march in a parade as Dignity
and the Spruce Street Singers.  Now if someone actively would
like to prevent any of these groups from fulfilling their goals,
he has the option to lobby against their legal efforts.  But no
one has a right to prevent the group from existing, or from
displaying their pride in a parade that celebrates it.
<p>     I remember coming out and thinking "Gay Pride?  Why would
anyone be proud of being gay?"  But I soon realized that the
pride is not in your orientation, but in living YOUR life YOUR
way despite society's attitudes.  That is truly what Pride Day is
about, and the groups that some people find offensive are just as
proud of accepting and living their lifestyle as I am of mine. 
If people are offended, perhaps they should re-examine their
attitudes, and (more importantly) worry about their own lives and
not fret about lifestyles that don't touch theirs in any way. 
And let's face it - enough people out there are offended by ANY
demonstration of our gay pride that partitioning our community
would be a self-destructive waste of time.  Remember what we're
fighting for - our own personal freedom.
