<center><h2> BREAKING NEWS!!! Palmieri Descendants Sue for Baratarian Throne!!!</h2>
<h3>DNA Testing a Possibility, heirs say</h3></center>
<p>
(AP) -- Marco Palmieri XI and his distant cousin, Elvis Palmieri, have
sued the government of Barataria, claiming that their ancestors, Marco
Palmieri I and Giuseppe Palmieri, respectively, were wrongfully denied the
Baratarian throne in 1750.
<p>
The seventh king of Barataria was believed to be abducted by the Grand
Inquisitor and placed in the household of Baptisto Palmieri, a Venetian
gondolier, who raised the monarch along with his own son.  When the
supposed king and Palmieri's son attained their majority, however, it was
revealed by the king's former nurse, Inez [no last name is known], that in
fact she had switched the infant king with her own son, fearing foul play
against her charge.  The man she had raised as her own son was crowned
Luiz I and reigned for 32 years, a beloved if slightly colorless monarch.
<p>
Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri withdrew their claim to the throne amicably
and returned to Venice.  Now, however, 250 years later, their descendants
are claiming that they were the victims of a fraud.
<p>
"Inez claimed that Luiz was the king, but how do we know she wasn't
lying?" Marco XI said in a press conference yesterday.  "Nobody checked up
on her statement.  Everybody had an incentive to accept the statement.
The king of Barataria was married in infancy [to Casilda, daughter of the
Duke of Plaza-Toro]; Marco and Giuseppe were already married and were
relieved to be able to return to their wives.  Everyone else was happy
because they didn't like the Palmieri's politics.  And so they said
nothing and Inez' son received the prize -- a royal crown and a golden
throne."
<p>
Complicating the Palmieris' claim is the fact that their ancestors' birth
remains obscure.  While either Marco or Giuseppe was the son of Baptisto
Palmieri and his wife, Angelina, and the other the son of Inez (or, as
their descendants allege, king of Barataria), nobody could ever establish
which was which during their lifetimes.  Angelina Palmieri died when the
children were still less than a year old, and soon after her death, her
husband fell into bad habits, drinking and keeping bad company.  Formerly
a rising star on the local political scene, Palmieri sank into apathy,
neglecting his children and unable even to tell them apart.  Eventually
one distinct name stuck definitely to each, but Palmieri probably forgot
and certainly never told anyone which boy was his own and which was
adopted.  As few of his acquaintance were even aware that one was adopted
at all, the father's mixup seemed harmless until Marco and Giuseppe were
grown up and learned that one of them was destined for the throne of
Barataria.  The problem was shelved by having the two reign jointly until
Inez revealed what was accepted as the truth.
<p>
No attempt seems to have been made by either the Palmieris or Inez to
establish which man was her son.  "This is already suspicious," Marco XI
said.  "What kind of mother doesn't even try to figure out who her son is?
She just let them go home -- while she remained in Barataria enjoying
wealth and position under Luiz' patronage."  He added that Inez'
credibility is further undermined by her shady connections; at the time of
her statement she was married to a notorious brigand who afterwards, also
with support from the Baratarian monarchy, increased his band and went to
sea as a pirate, establishing a successful operation that drew many new
recruits, chiefly from disaffected members of the British upper classes.
<p>
The Palmieris continued to act as gondoliers for many generations; in the
case of Marco's line, to the present.  Giuseppe's great-great-grandson,
Giuseppe Verdi Palmieri, became actively involved in the Italian
independence movement, was exiled, and eventually moved to the United
States, settling in Connecticut, where his descendants still live.
<p>
Marco Palmieri XI and Elvis Palmieri are demanding that the bodies of
Luiz, Marco, Giuseppe, and Inez be exhumed for DNA testing.  "That's the
only way we can establish who was related to whom," Marco XI said.  "We're
lucky to have resources today that weren't available in the eighteenth
century.  There's no more need to speculate as to who was lying and who
was telling the truth -- just do the test."
<p>
The Baratarian government has so far been silent on the subject of the
lawsuit, but a spokesman indicated today that attempts to exhume Luiz I
will be opposed.  "We see no reason to question the succession of
Barataria.  Until compelling evidence is adduced that Inez was lying, we
decline to disturb the rest of our monarch."
<p>
Most members of the royal family declined to comment on the proceedings,
but Queen Nekaya said today that the entire lawsuit is a vast left-wing
conspiracy to get her husband, Luiz the XI, off the throne.  "All they
want to do is take over with their republican agendas of equality.  Look
what that did to Barataria in the months when their ancestors were here?
It took years for the country to recover from their demoralizing
influence."
<p>
An international tribunal will hear the case next month.

<h4>Ted comments:</h4>
I have it on the authority of one of my neighbors, a barber of impeccable
standing, that the Palmieris of Connecticut have joined with other
branches of the family in other states, in a class-action suit against
the throne.  Luigi Palmieri, a respected capo of The Family, has declined
to comment, citing the Fifth Amendment, and referring further questions
to his Consigliere.
<p>
<h4>P. Cohen comments:</h4>

Not so. Not all the Palmieris of Connecticut are interested in Luigi's
class action suit. There are many of them here in Westport, successfully
pursuing their garden and landscaping trades with no royal pretensions. 
<p>
They do take annual vacations, however, and get in a bit of nostalgia
and  gondoliering in Venice. But not, they insist, during the tourist
season.

<center><h2>MORE BREAKING NEWS IN BARATARIA !!!</h2>
<h3>BARATARIA INDEPENDENT COUNSEL RELEASES SURPRISE REPORT</h3></center>

BARATARIA (AP) -- Barataria's Independent Counsel released an exhaustive
report today detailing alleged wrongdoings of Don Alhambra Del Bolero, the
Grand Inquisitor of Spain, during his term from 1721 - 1754. 
<p>
The report follows a highly publicized suit against the Baratarian
monarchy by Marco Palmieri XI and Elvis Palmieri, who claim their
ancestors were wrongfully denied the Baratarian throne in the
mid-eighteenth century.
<p>
Most of the 450-page report focuses on the inappropriate relationship of
the Grand Inquisitor and Inez, foster mother/nursemaid of King Luiz I.
<p>
All parties agree upon the background of the case. In 1731, Del Bolero
became a central and revered figure in the history of Barataria when he
placed the infant king in the 18th-century equivalent of a
witness-protection program. Soon after these protective measures were
taken, the rest of the infant's family were killed in an insurrection.
<p>
Historians regard Del Bolero's actions as one of the finest examples of
governmental foresight in written history. 
<p>
"The actions of Del Bolero, though contrary to etiquette standards of his
day, are rivaled only by those of Joseph of Nazareth," said Hannah Rose
Murgatroyd, professor of history at SavoyNet International University.
"Circa 4 A.D., [Joseph of Nazareth] fled to Egypt to extract his
foster son, the Christ child, from harm's way. Del Bolero and Nazareth's
actions both saved the lives of future kings." 
<p>
This statement was deemed irrelevant by Barataria's Independent Counsel,
Gilbert S. Williams. "That really doesn't matter," he said. "Del Bolero
had more than an etiquette problem." 
<p>
<h4>Grand Indiscretions</h4>
According to the Williams Report, Del Bolero chose to place the child in
the care of Baptisto Palmieri, a Venetian gondolier who was to raise the
royal child alongside his own son.  Del Bolero also selected a nursemaid
for the boy. 
<p>
After the sudden death of Palmieri, Del Bolero stated that none but the
nursemaid, Inez -- who had recently left Venice -- could tell the
difference between the infant king and the infant gondolier. But he made
no efforts to locate the nursemaid until nearly twenty years later. 
<p>
Williams's report states that Inez may have murdered Palmieri and then
fled in a well-constructed plot to overthrow the monarchy. 
<p>
According to the report, "there is no probable, possible shadow of doubt
whatever" that Del Bolero suspected her role in Palmieri's death.
<p>
Del Bolero allegedly did not pursue Inez, allegedly giving her special
treatment because he and Inez allegedly had an affair in the early 1730s. 
<p>
The result of that affair was allegedly a son, Luiz. 
<p>
Del Bolero allegedly intended to protect himself and his wife, The Numera
Una Signora Del Bolero, from embarrassment by choosing not to recognize the
child as his own. 
<p>
According to Inez's diary, Del Bolero told her to never mention the
paternal roots of the child. He also instructed her to dispose of the many
gifts he gave her. 
<p>
Inez allegedly did as she was asked, but she felt slighted by the request.
She had hoped to become the Nueva Numera Una Signora Del Bolero.
<p>
She is accused of avenging the slight by controlling Del Bolero's actions
and statements in political matters surrounding the search for the heir to
the Baratarian throne by threatening to go public with their affair.
<p>
With this leverage, Inez refused to tell Del Bolero the identity of the
true king in private conferences. She instead demanded to reveal the news
directly to the citizens of Barataria because she "craved the national
publicity, acceptance and adoration" that Del Bolero had not supplied her
with in their relationship. 
<p>
In what Williams calls "exceptionally poor judgement,"  Del Bolero allowed
her make this declaration "to silver clarion's sound" under oath in
Barataria's Court.
<p>
Inez allegedly then purjured herself in order to crown their son as King
of Barataria. Thus, by not extracting the information from Inez himself as
he should have, Del Bolero became an accomplice in a case of obstruction
of justice.
<p>
"He never even brought her to the torture chamber," said Williams,
"although he told the Palmieris that he did." 
<p>

<h4>Boatloads of Evidence</h4>

This afternoon, Williams brought two boatloads of evidence to the Court of
Barataria, including post-1750 correspondence between Inez and Del Bolero. 
In one letter, Inez reportedly wrote, "Dear Donnie, I am quite pleased
with my position in our son's kingdom.  There are such wonderful benefits
to parenting royalty. I only wish you would come share them with me -- but
that's so like you.  Never, ever around when we need you. Inez." 
<p>
Other evidence includes diaries detailing her encounters with Del Bolero
and DNA evidence from a 257-year-old dress of Inez's taken from the castle
museum. 
<p>
A man on the street who had heard about the case said, "I don't get it,
that DNA stuff, y'know? They shouldn't be goin' diggin' into ancient
closets. I'm not just not jiggy wit dat."  Pondering the intrinsic poetry
of his own words, the young man gazed sadly upon the reflection of the
moon in the misty river.  The weight of the world seemed to pressed down
upon his shoulders as a spacecraft abruptly landed on his back, killing
him instantly.
<p>
Other critics are equally bothered by the report.
<p>
"I am baffled by Williams's obsession with detail,"  said CNN editor
Miriam Grosvenor. "These 450 pages represent massive energies and
resources funneled into research of a centuries-old relationship that has
little relevance to the case at hand. Williams really could have made his
case composing such an explicit report." 
<p>
Baratarian citizen Virgil Tartarioli expressed concern over the report's
implications. "Barataria has always had a reputation of nonexistence. This
has had an historic effect upon our national sense of identity; we are
worse off even than Canadians," he said. "People do not believe that there
is such a country as our own. Well," he spat, "there is!" 
<p>
"Anyways, if the sainted Del Bolero was a rogue, and our king is *not* the
great Luiz XI, we will definitely, *definitely* have another identity
crisis," Tartarioli said. He added, "It will be especially bad if DNA
tests prove that Elvis is the King."
<p>
Williams's report is entitled, "List and Learn, ye Dainty Monarchs."  The
first 73 pages of the report are set to music of unknown origin.

<h2>SCANDAL DEEPENS</h2>

<h3>PLAZA TORO HEIR ASKS INTERPOL TO DETERMINE SOURCE OF CASILDA STORY</h3></center>

PLAZA TORO, SPAIN (AP) -- Following the disclosure that Queen Casilda
of Barataria had an adulterous affair with her suite, Luiz, a
suspicious heir of the Plaza Toro, Limited conglomerate is asking for
help from Interpol to determine if the source of the story was a
descendant of Don Alhambra del Bolero, who has recently come under
suspicion of wrongdoing by the Barataria Independant Counsel.
<p>
"We have reason to believe that those who have the most to lose if the
current allegations are true have been orchestrating a conspiracy to
intimidate members of the independant counsel by attempting to drag
the monarchy into the scandal," said Guillermo S. Gilberto Friday
afternoon.
<p>
Admitting he has no evidence the heirs are behind the Casilda story,
Gilberto said, "I have no doubt who it is, I just don't have the
evidence to prove it and that's why we want Interpol."
<p>
The story of Casilda's adulterous affair first broke Thursday in an
Internet magazine.  Furious counsel members immediately went on the
attack, defending Casilda and accusing the Bolero heirs of spreading
the report.  Baratarians of all walks of life have publicly condemned
the Casilda story.
<p>
"Why can't they just leave us alone?  It's those Palmieri's fault,"
said Virgil Tartarioli.  "This is not the identity we want the world
to see."
<p>
<h4>Casilda's affair took place prior to learning her husband's identity</h4>

The story of the adulterous relationship between Casilda, when she was
twenty-one, and Luiz, himself a married man, broke Thursday in the
obscure Internet magazine, Nolas.
<p>
"The statute of limitations has long since passed on her youthful
indiscretions," Gilberto said in a statement.  "Suffice it to say,
once Casilda and Luiz realized that they were, in fact, husband and
wife, they no longer considered their affair adulterous."
<p>
According to Nolas, the affair lasted for several years, and ended
after Casilda learned that she had been secretly wed in babyhood to
the infant son of the King of Barataria.  Though it later transpired
that Luiz was that same son, the article accuses the two of immoral
conduct because they had no reason to believe that they were married
at the time of their actions.
<p>
The article also made passing references to "shady dealings" of the
Plaza Toro, Ltd. company, and theorized that such actions by the
parents of Casilda must surely have had an effect on her upbringing.
