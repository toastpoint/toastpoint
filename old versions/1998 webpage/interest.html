<a name="advice"><h3>Advice:</h3>
For advice on any subject, large or small, ask the erudite 
<A HREF="http://www.grandiose.com">Sir Charles Grandiose</A>.
<hr>

<a name="alma"><h3>Alma Maters:</h3>
<i>"Hark the students' voices swelling, strong and true and clear..."</I>  
Visit the virtual sites of my bright college days: <a href=http://www.wm.edu/>The College of William and
Mary</a> and <a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">Peabody Conservatory</a>.
<hr></a>

<a name="friends"><h3>Friends and Family:</h3>
<ul>
<li>My father edits the newsletter for 
<a href="http://www.serve.com/SECHUMLO/">The Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry</a>.  
He also designed the web page initially, but has passed it on to someone who is more into it.<li>
My old college roommate and HTML guru maintains the unusually rococo
<a href="http://www.grandiose.com/vance.html">Cul-de-Sac Briceland</a>.  
Very much worth visiting.  
<li>
Pay a visit to 
<a href="http://www.reed.edu/~harlowe/">Esther's La-La Land</a>, the virtual reality
of my bouncy young friend who was such a delightful host to us 
in <a href=travel/bayarea.html>San Francisco</a>.
<li>
My first friend met entirely through the Internet, poetess-extraordinaire Victoria..., runs the poetry mecca of <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~yeolde">
Ye Olde Font Shoppe</a>.
<li>
<a href="http://wanda.pond.com/~stevecap/Welcome.htm">Steven Capsuto</a>, 
media historian extraordinaire has a great page with all sorts of literary and library-ish links.
<li>
Miss <a href=http://members.aol.com/bluefairy/>Alan Lutton</a> is another friend of mine from 
various directions in Philadelphia, most notably two-stepping.
<li>
My buddies <a href=http://keck.ucsf.edu/~holder>Gaylord Holder</a> and 
Marianne Lipson (a spousal team) are 
bright and interesting persons, have cleverly given up Philadelphia for 
San Francisco, and on June 30, 1997, produced a little person named Campbell Hannegan 
Holder!  (Note: we got to <a href=travel/bayarea.html>visit them</a> over Memorial Day.)
<li>
Former co-worker 
<A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/people/johnd/">John D'Angelo</a> has a home page, but it 
seems to have degenerated into a lot of pictures of his kid.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
<li>
<a href="http://www.cyclic.com/~kingdon/">Jim Kingdon</a> 
is a bright math and computer 
specialist who plays trumpet in DC's Different Drummers and two-steps too!
</ul>

<a name="gay"><h3>Gay Stuff</h3>
If you're a ten-percenter, or 'just curious', check out the 
<a href="http://www.qrd.org/QRD/www/index.html">Queer Resources Directory</a>.  
I'm a <a href="http://www.skepsis.com/.glbo/bears/index.html">bear</a>-lover myself, although 
I've found bears don't measure up to Wumpuses.  You can find your own with 
<a  href="http://www.cnct.com/home/markk/br/brroul20.htm">Bear Roulette</a>, though!
<hr>

<a name="gods"><h3>Gods and Goddesses</h3>
<b>Singer Gods</b> - Hop over to <a href="http://cdnow.com/">CD Now</a> 
and do a search on Michael McDonald!  They have some beautiful GIFs of him - 
unfortunately, they also have a proprietary notice so I can't just link to them 
myself. <p>

<b>Singer Goddesses</b> - To visit the page of my goddess of love, try the <A
HREF="http://www.automatrix.com/~lavin/">Christine Lavin</a> home page.  
Or the up-and-coming folkie who I actually <b><i>know!</i></b> - 
<a href=http://www.private-music.com/pm/susan/susan.html>Susan Werner</a>, 
who released her first nationally-released album, "Last of the 
Good Straight Girls", last year.  Buy
it, buy it!  
<p>
<b>Actress Goddesses</b> - 
Pay your oscarial respects at the 
<a href="http://zen.sunderland.ac.uk/~aa1gha/susan.html">Susan 
Sarandon Shrine</a>, the 
<a href="http://128.205.200.100/~sanborn/Emma_html/emma.html">Emma 
Thompson Worship Page</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.tcp.com/~mary/foster.html">Jodie Foster Gallery</a>!  
We also adore 
<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~harshec/WWW/Winona.html"> Winona Ryder</a>.
And of course, Winona's little sister from Mermaids, 
<a href="http://www.webcom.com/~alsplace/christina_ricci/christina_main.html">Christina 
Ricci</a>!
<p>
Other goddesses on their way.  There doesn't seem to be a Carol Burnett page...yet.
<hr>
<a name="gossip"><h3>Gossip</h3>
One of the most edifying collection of minds on the planet can be found discoursing in 
the newsgroup 
<a href=news:alt.showbiz.gossip>alt.showbiz.gossip</a>.  But for goshsake, read the 
<a href=http://www.rt66.com/~nlopez/afaq.htm>Anti-FAQ</a> and lurk a while 
before you post, lest you 
(a) get flamed as YABWFTNOTN, (b) spell out the word <em>l______</em>, or (c) invoke the ASG curse.
<hr>
<a name="humor"><h3>Humor</h3>
I used to spend my working days in a corporate environment much like <a
href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert">Dilbert</a> has to
deal with.  Now I work for a <a href=http://www.executech.com>company 
he would adore.</a><p>
But those who know me know I play and collect musical instruments, so 
this page of 
<A href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/jcb/other-instrument-jokes.html">instrument jokes</A> 
holds a place near and dear to my heart.  Especially the soprano jokes.<p>

<a href=http://mirsky.com/wow/>Worst of the Web</a> page.
