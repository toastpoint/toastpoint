<h4>The Toast Point Theatrical Legacy</h4>
I spent a great deal of my college career at William and Mary involved in 
<a href=http://www.sinfonicron.org>Sinfonicron</a>, which is not 
a satanic organization, but rather a student-run light opera company.  
It's been around forever and boasts such luminary alumni as Calvin Remsberg.  When 
I was a wee freshman, they did Gilbert and Sullivan every year, but during my 
career, they broke away and did <em>The Merry Widow</em> and since have produced 
such shows as <em>Evita</em> and <em>42nd Street</em>.
<p>
Around the same time, I spent a couple of summers working with 
<a href=http://www.wst.org/>Wildwood Summer Theatre</a>, a youth-run 
group which has also been around forever and boasts such luminary alumni as 
Jonathan Hadari and Stella Zambalis.
<p>
Once I got through with the school thing, I ended up in Philadelphia, where 
I did such killer shows as <em>Evita</em> and <em>Follies</em> with 
<a href=http://www.netaxs.com/~mss/pcs.html>The Players Club of Swarthmore</a>, 
a community theatre group whose grasp is extraordinary, and whose reach often 
achieves it.

<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>Eric shows you the way to wonderful artists you've never heard of</h3>
Like all of you, I thought folk music was overly sincere hippies
with bad voices 
singing about the rainforests - until I fell hopelessly and
completely in
love with <A HREF="http://www.automatrix.com/~lavin/">Christine
Lavin</a>.  And I feel oh-so-proud, because I introduced Christine's music 
to <a href=http://www.songs.com/susan/susan-home.html>Susan Werner</a>, 
a fellow cast member in an opera we did years ago, 
and Susan is now a famous (and very talented) folk singer herself and a Friend of Christine's!
<p>
I may be the only person on the east coast who's ever heard of 
folk/rock singer <a href=http://www.michaeltomlinson.com>Michael 
Tomlinson</a>, but I have all his albums and he's a very interesting singer.  A 
spiritually and environmentally aware songwriter, his songs are 
soothing and inspiring.  Check out his web page, and if you are interested 
in finding out what he's like, I would order "Run This Way Forever" as 
your starter album.
<p>
Another wonderful folk singer who I discovered because *blush* I liked 
his picture on the album cover is Maine-based 
<a href="http://www.bicoastal.com/dmallett/index.html">Dave Mallett</a>.  You'd 
think he'd be too close to the land to have a home page, but there it is.
<h3>Eric shows you the way to tacky but fun artists who you'll never 
admit to liking:</h3>
Thank you, 
<a href=http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3973/abfab.htm>AbFab</a>, 
for bringing us the knowledge of the existence of hopelessly self-referential 
rap-song artist <a href=http://www.netzone.co.uk/tempest/boo/boo.html>Betty Boo</a>.   Nothin' you can do when Boo's doin' the do!
<p>
Thank you, Sweden, for engendering <a href=http://www.sirius.com/~funnyguy/abbanaticfolder/abbanatic.html>ABBA</a>, 
the finest pop group of all time.  And they're multilingual, too!
<p>
<h3>Rainbow Symphonic Winds/Big Apple Corps/LGBA</h3>
I'm the current (temporary) conductor of the 
<a href=http://www.dorsai.org/~jazzbike/band3.htm>Rainbow Symphonic Winds of New York</a>, 
which is a member of the <A
HREF="http://agora.rdrop.com/~joe/lgba.html">Lesbian and Gay Bands
of America</A>.

see what I've written in <a href=ponder.html>Toast Points to Ponder</a> and
