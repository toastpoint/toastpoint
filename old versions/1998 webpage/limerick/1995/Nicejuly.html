<h2>Squeaky-Clean Entries from July 1995</h2>
Sadly, we declared no winners in this category for July due to the 
lack of entries.  Strangely enough, the naughty limerick contest had 
<em>many</em> entries...

<h2>The Entries for July</h2>
<h3>Mark Chartrand writes 7/10</h3>
The erudite Charles Grandiose<br>
Gave answers quite often verbose.<br>
Culling grain from the chaff<br>
Rarely produced a laugh<br>
And the reader became comatose
<hr>

<h3>Toast Point writes 7/1</h3>
My Wumpus is covered with hair<br>
And therefore he's never quite bare<br>
But he's awfully sweet<br>
So cute and so neat<br>
That I think we make quite a pair!
