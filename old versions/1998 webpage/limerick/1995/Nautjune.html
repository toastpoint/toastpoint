<h3>In the Best Allegory Category, Oldcoach takes the prize:</h3>
Good marks for oldtimer, Omar.<br>
Who can't raise his tent very far.<br>
His plumbing is rusted<br>
He can't cut the mustard<br>
So's an expert at licking the jar.
<p>

<h3>In the Genteel Naughtiness category, Lord Chomondley Fitz-Nobbins tops it with:</H3>
I know that you'll think me quite dotty,<BR>
But please, no caffeine in the latte!<BR>
One simple espresso -<BR>
I put on a dress, oh,<BR>
And really start acting quite naughty! 
<HR>
<H2>
Dishonorable Mention</H2>
<h3>Michael McNeilley writes 6/26</h3>
It's stupid to call it a binge<br>
The main line is not on the fringe<br>
Like the touch of your hand<br>
As I untie the tube and<br>
Pull blood back into the syringe<br>
<b>HUGE Editorial Note:</b> <i>This ain't naughty, but it's certainly not 
squeaky-clean.  Mr. McNeilley informed the sage that his intention was to
write a limerick that was "not funny".  The sage believes that he succeeded.</i>

<h3>Anonymous writes 6/16</h3>
I'm no longer sure of my gender<br>
Since the night I went out on a bender<br>
I wrecked up the car<br>
When I left from the bar....<br>
From my groin they removed that darn fender.
<hr>
<h3>Iris B. Gone writes 6/16</h3>
Your pussy, my dear Mrs. Slocum,<br>
Is missing, or stolen, or brokum<br>
I'm sorry to say<br>
I looked forward one day<br>
To dig in my fingers and strokum.

<H3>Eleanor Pontiuse writes 6/13</H3>
Enduring a rectal exam<BR>
Colonscopes are so cold I scream &quot;Damn!&quot;<BR>
He'll push and he'll pull it - <BR>
I'll just bite the bullet<BR>
And be grateful I don't have to cram! 
<HR>

Flabbergast writes 6/11</H3>
The pastor, ignoring his vows<BR>
Made altar boys practice their bows<BR>
And gaining admission<BR>
By their angled position<BR>
Just slid right on up there, the louse! 
<HR>
<H3>
Tim the Autobiographical writes 6/7</H3>
In Vancouver a new married pair<BR>
Settled down in their S&M lair<BR>
Decor was a snap<BR>
With the whips, chains, and flaps<BR>
But the drapes were a bit of a bear. 
<HR>
<H3>
Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/5</H3>
Twin sisters - Awana, Anita<BR>
Never swallowed the cream from the meat-a<BR>
One chose to spit<BR>
When her mouth filled with it,<BR>
And the other liked hers on a pita. 
<HR>
<H3>
Yagno's Train writes 6/3</H3>
When eating a veggie beware<BR>
Be sure you're proceeding with care<BR>
*CHOMP*LICK* Ooh what fun,<BR>
And now that you're done<BR>
Help her back up to her wheelchair.
