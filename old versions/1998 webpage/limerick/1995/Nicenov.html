<h3>Larry Dahl writes 11/30</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
When my PC gets tired of working,<br>
It leaps on the Web for some lurking.<br>
It openly smiles<br>
When it peaks into files.<br>
And it's not above flagrantly smirking.
<p>
My computer crawls out every night<br>
On the Web with a grim apetite.<br>
It will search by the hour<br>
For bits to devour.<br>
Then gobbles two cubed in each byte.
<p>
I concede my computer now knows<br>
More each day for its memory grows.<br>
But I still can't explain<br>
How a silicon brain<br>
Can know that I know that it knows!

<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/29</h3>

Princess Di gave reporters the power<br>
To interview her for an hour<br>
And, with true British pluck<br>
She trashed Liz and Chuck;<br>
She's regretting it now in the Tower.

<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/21</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
There are thousands of brands of computers,<br>
Each of which has its own rooters;<br>
And each rooter bristles<br>
If yours has more whistles<br>
Or klaxons or sirens or hooters.

<h3>Lisa the Limerick Lady writes 11/17</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
When you sneeze and you cough and you're achin<br>
And you feel that your body is breakin'<br>
Just try to recall<br>
it's still only Fall;<br>
Old man winter has yet to awaken.

<hr>
<h3>John Futhey writes 11/11</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
"So you take your wife everywhere. Why?<br>
She's so ugly she makes children cry!"<br>
"Well, if I should roam<br>
And leave her at home,<br>
I'm obliged then to kiss her goodbye!<br>


<hr>
<h3>Spencer writes 11/7</h3>
The tile in my bathroom is striking<br>
But it's not to my beloved's liking.<br>
Rhonda rants, "Rose, not red!<br>
What's wrong with your head?<br>
Wear your helmet when you go out biking!"

<hr>
<h3>Emma Basingstoke writes a multi-verser 11/3</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
These dreary cold days of November<br>
Have given me cause to remember<br>
That although I'm depressed, <br>
In a way, I've been blessed - <br>
At least I've a month 'til December.<p>

I've never been fond of cold weather;<br>
I can do without snow altogether.<br>
When the geese fly due south<br>
I get down in the mouth...<br>
I guess that we're birds of a feather.<p>

So picture me snug in my bed,<br>
The covers pulled over my head.<br>
Avoiding the winter - <br>
The frosty tormenter - <br>
And dreaming of summer instead.

<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>

<h3>Larry Dahl writes 11/30</h3>
A computer could help in detecting<br>
The secrets that Clinton's protecting.<br>
If there's no water gate<br>
In Clinton's home state,<br>
They'll need rapid white water inspecting.
<p>
Determining primes is a problem<br>
Computers attack out of boredom.<br>
I think it's a crime<br>
Every number's not prime.<br>
If they were, I could easily find them.
<p>
A computer who thought he was bright<br>
Ray traced a companion one night.<br>
The result, so it seems,<br>
Was the girl of his dreams.<br>
Now nothing he does is quite right.

<hr>
<h3>Ed Hager writes 11/29</h3>
I sit on the Web all night and just cruise;<br>
If I have a crash there is nothing to bruise;<br>
While speeding along I thought that I might<br>
Stop for awhile and check out this cool site<br>
It definitely has the power to amuse.<p>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>Well, we try...</i>

<hr>
<h3>Kindell Keyes writes 11/29</h3>
I would love to feel the cool breeze and smell the fresh air<br>
But I can't feel or smell from down here<br>
Because everyone that is standing is about six feet tall<br>
and compare to them I'm quite small<br>
I guess I'm one of those people who get no respect at all.

<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 11/27</h3>
There once was a nice man named Wumpus<br>
A harmless old codger, a grumpus - <br>
That was our belief<br>
But Old Wump was a thief<br>
When we turned our backs, he would jump us!

<hr>
<h3>Ogden Nield writes 11/22</h3>
Melvin, who worshiped the Web<br>
Was a nebbish - his friends called him "Neb!"<br>
One day cast his eyes here<br>
And won the first prize here<br>
Now Melvin's become a celeb!
<hr>
<h3>Guess Who (or is that whom?) writes 11/7</h3>
Sir Charles, a pompous old Briton,<br>
Was friends with Sir Ed Bulwer-Litton.<br>
   Chuck gave him some light<br>
   On a dark, stormy night,<br>
Now the worst lines of all can be written.

<hr>
<h3>PumaCat writes 11/5</h3>
A mech going into battle one day<br>
Turned suddenly and HEY!!!<br>
What he thought was a log<br>
Was really a Mad Dog,<br>
And he got himself blown away.
