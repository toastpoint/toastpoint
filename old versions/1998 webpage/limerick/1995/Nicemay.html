<h3>Winning the "Self-Referential" category,<br>
Buckaroo writes 5/18</h3>
One day in the Emerald Isle<br>
I was writing haiku by the mile.<br>
But I craved a sensation--<br>
Limerick metric elation--<br>
Every other form 'twas mis'rabile.

<h3>And in the "Middle-Eastern Food" category,<br>
Anonymous writes 5/19</h3>
A courtesan eating falafel<br>
Finally said: "This is awful!<br>
My chick pea/bean diet<br>
Has caused me to riot - <br>
I'm craving a good belgian waffle!"<p>
NOTE: This limerick got upgraded from Honorable Mention because
Toast Point found it stuck in his mind and scanned rather nicely.

<h2>Honorable Mention:</h2>
<h3>Stan Harding writes 5/20</h3>
I know of an awful soprano<br>
Who, landing a guest spot on Leno,<br>
Was ired by his zingers<br>
Re her high shrieking stingers<br>
And threw him into the piano!
<hr>
<h3>Anita Manceau-Baddeley writes 5/19</h3>
I no longer want a deep tan.<br>
I've no need to catch me a man.<br>
Disconcern with my belly<br>
Has turned it to jelly<br>
And gone is the exercise plan.
<hr>
<h3>Buckaroo writes 5/18</h3>
My office is straight out of hell.<br>
My secret'ry's prone to misspell.<br>
The boss--he's a loon<br>
Aided by a buffoon,<br>
And that's it, in a simple nutshell.
