There was an optician respectable<br>
Who fell in his grinding receptacle<br>
He later was found<br>
All garnished and ground<br>
To mince-meat, and not a fine spectacle!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "To dispel any hideous myths about humans who are accidentally consumed by mechanical devices and then miraculously transformed into hard, translucent, inanimate objects."</i>
<p>
There was a young man called Carruther<br>
Who had twins by a surrogate mother<br>
At the moment of birth<br>
She pulled in her girth<br>
And out popped two more from his brother!<p>
My wife loves to watch a good thrilla<br>
It gives her goose bumps, all the chilla<br>
But the thing I most hate<br>
Is not going to bed late<br>
But waking at 3 with no pilla!
<p>
To make your point clear is quite simple<br>
Like squeezing an over-ripe pimple<br>
Just a touch of finesse<br>
Not too much, nor too less<br>
Or you'll end up with crater, not dimple !
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Asked by a friend to write a Lim about communication. I hope it works okay."</i>

The reason the prof's not elated:<br>
His condition has made him frustrated.<br>
His vowels, you know,<br>
Have lost get-up-and-go,<br>
And that is why he's consonated!
