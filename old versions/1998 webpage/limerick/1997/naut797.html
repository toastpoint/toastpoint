My vibrator's battery's dying!<br>
She told him as she started crying.<br>
'Though she sucked like a pro<br>
She could not make it grow.<br>
"You bastard, you're not even trying!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yes, we have no bananas.  We have no bananas, today."</i>

Are those bountiful mammaries real?<br>
He asked with unusual zeal.<br>
His dick started to rise<br>
But then came the surprise<br>
When he felt them, they're harder than steel!

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/30/97</h3>
In my sixties, I had an affair.<br>
The woman was 18, mon cher.<br>
And my old waterspout - <br>
She just wore it out.<br>
I'm glad that I have Medicare!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Clinton told her, "I'm glad that I met ya."<br>
At the Marriott she said "I'll let ya."<br>
She was stunning and dark<br>
So Bill asked as a lark<br>
"Ubangi?"  And she said "You betcha!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is in reference to Gary Aldrich, former FBI agent, 
whose source suggested that Bill sneaked away to the Marriott on occasion."</i>
<p>

It is said that Prince Andrew is Randy.<br>
At the White House, Bill offered him candy.<br>
"This is bloody delight!<br>
You're the Kingfish, all right."<br>
What a photo-op: Anus and Andy!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Can anyone imagine talking about another president this way?"</i>
<p>
So tell us, does size really matter?<br>
It might, if erect on a ladder.<br>
Should you happen to cough<br>
It could push you right off<br>
And your manhood may very well shatter!
<hr>
<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 07/26/97</h3>
Doc, yesterday, wielding my hatchet,<br>
It slipped before I could catch it<br>
It sliced through my pants<br>
And severed my lance.<br>
Do you think that perhaps you could patch it?
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
The Hindus, in their catechism<br>
Treat sex as they do mysticism.<br>
It seems an orgasm<br>
Is not just a spasm,<br>
But more of a great cataclysm!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
His orange dick made him feel unstable - <br>
"Doctor. please help if you're able!"<br>
"There's no sore or decay - <br>
How do you spend your day?"<br>
"I eat Cheetos and watch porno cable!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I've written over 6,000 in the last four years, 2/3 of which bash the first evil couple in Washington."</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage fiddled with it, just a bit.</i>
<p>
Two great lies that they say never fail<br>
That make lenders and women turn pale<br>
From dyslexic execs - <br>
"In your mouth are the checks<br>
And I swear I won't cum in the mail."
<p>
I saw your dear wife as she glowers<br>
Oh yes, I'm enjoying your flowers<br>
The next time you drop by<br>
I'll be sucking you dry<br>
As a meatloaf that baked seven hours.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/25/97</h3>
Kasimoto had won the election,<br>
But his speech had a slight imperfection.<br>
His English was poor,<br>
And I must underscore<br>
That he called the event an erection!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a rittle bit obvious."</i>

Some dextrous old ladies from Natchez<br>
Could all open up beers with their snatches<br>
(Which is fun 'til yer crease<br>
Gets infected with yeast<br>
And it burns like a whole book of matches!)

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Just came up with that while driving into work this morning. I haven't 
been getting much sleep lately.</i>
<hr>
<h3>David B writes 07/24/97</h3>
There was an old codger named Mort<br>
Who with a young thing did cavort - <br>
And when he was tried,<br>
His attorney denied,<br>
Saying the evidence won't stand up in court.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/24/97</h3>
I don't blame you if you want to shout<br>
That you have a great big waterspout.<br>
But keep it in indoors,<br>
Or in sophomores,<br>
And, in public, don't let it hang out!
<hr>
<h3>Arrrgg writes 07/24/97</h3>
There once was a pirate well known...<br>
For not taking the crow's nest alone..<br>
He slipped once while frigging<br>
Way up in the rigging<br>
And he fell, and he broke his best bone!

<i>The poet comments, "From my Renn Faire days playing a pirate."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:brickman.2@osu.edu>Stiffy Joe</a> writes 07/20/97</h3>
There once lived an unhandy chap<br>
Deathly afraid of the clap<br>
His future looked bleak<br>
When along came a geek<br>
Who said, "I'll show you how to choke your chicken."
<p>
<I>Chap, clap....chicken?</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/19/97</h3>
Her majesty could not abide him.<br>
She'd tease him and always deride him.<br>
But her lust made her waive,<br>
And she said of her slave,<br>
"The serf's up, and I plan to ride him."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'm looking for a publisher. Now, that's funny!"</i>

Quoth the man with a miniscule dong<br>
"I never did anything wrong<br>
To deserve such a fate,<br>
Yet I know it's too late,<br>
Why can't we all get a long?

<h3>John Chastaine writes 07/17/97</h3>
My vibrator's battery's dying!<br>

The gargantuan groaner,<br>
Wants to massage his boner,<br>
So, Evereadys I soon will be buying.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/17/97</h3>
Now some of my rhymes are absurd.<br>
I try to avoid a cuss word.<br>
Ryhme and meter take over,<br>
And I'm a pushover<br>
For "titty" and "pecker" and "turd."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "And they tell me there are other such words."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Margo writes 07/16/97</h3>

Delight in her warm, sexy mood.<br>

And now she is sure to be screwed!

<i>The poet comments, "I converted my lawyer limerick!"</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/13/97</h3>
A Frenchman exudes savoir faire.<br>
He would never say, "Her ass is bare."<br>
When he sees the cute butt<br>
Of a sleek, nubile slut,<br>
He always says, "Cute derriere."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is almost a clean one."</i>
<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/11/97</h3>
I love to watch movies with Xena.<br>
She has such a sexy demeanor.<br>
She has legs that are long,<br>
And she does own a thong<br>
And some things that are even obscener!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Does the Sage know how many hits this site gets each day?"</i>
<p>
<i>The entire Toast Point page, all contests and other stuff included,

He applied for it; no hesitation.<br>
He thought he had found his vocation.<br>
He read the ad fast.<br>
His ideal at last!<br>
He thought it said "pubic relations."

And then leave the stage, two abreast."

<h3>Writerman writes 07/10/97</h3>

<I>Hee hee hee.</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:FLLWP>Poet Lariat</a> writes 07/10/97</h3>
Are those bountiful mammaries real?<br>
They'd provide ten sextuplets a meal<br>
Just one nipple's a sin<br>
And a gross waste of skin<br>
Udder waste - all the dairymen feel.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Almost bagged this one....but kept at it..and milked it for all it was worth..."</i>

For the sake of the blind<br>
Was precisely the same, but in braille!

My vibrator's battery's dying!<br>
If I said "so what?!"..I'd be lying<br>
Although I am gay<br>
And can't use it that way<br>
You can't blame a poor boy for trying!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "try the energizers..."</i>
<p>
So tell us, does size really matter?<br>
Greater pleasure if longer or fatter?<br>
At a crime scene they say<br>
Rapists could get away<br>
For the small ones leave only a smatter!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
"My lord" said the wench to her master<br>
In this Sawmill you've never gone faster<br>
But, my dear, I'm afraid<br>
If they turn on the blade<br>
we cannot avert a dis -assed -her !

<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 07/09/97</h3>
"Cleopatra," said randy young Pharoah,<br>

That you can't get it in;<br>
It seems I've a farrow too narrow!"

Then purged from his oil of Castor!

A guy met a good looking female<br>
After sending her plenty of email.<br>
With a little romance<br>
He was soon in her panse,<br>
But was shocked to find out she was she-male!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A contortionist by the name Draper<br>
Wouldn't wipe himself with toilet paper.<br>
Instead he'd clean his bung,<br>
With the tip of his tongue,<br>
To relish the taste and the vapor!

Her nipples are honey to taste,<br>

But I'm pleased after all,<br>
'Cause more than a mouthful's a waste!

<h3>Anonymous shares a classic non-limerick 07/05/97</h3>
He drank with curvy Mable<br>
The pace was fast and furious<br>
He slid beneath the table<br>
Not  drunk, but merely curious.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/05/97</h3>
I bragged of the size, as I drank.<br>
This "tool", this "wang", this "shank."<br>
But my sweetie, named Beulah,<br>
Pulled out a long ruler,<br>
And at the wrong moment, I shrank!

<hr>
<h3>MR WITTY writes 07/03/97</h3>
A man by the name of Witty<br>
Is a little bit shitty<br>
He has a gold car<br>
but not a gold star<br>
He is hoping Toast Point will take pity.
<p>
<I>The poet asked Toast Point to tell him (in limerick form) how to get a gold star.  Well, since he submitted a nasty-word limerick in all caps to the squeaky-clean section, Toast Point is too appalled to be able to respond in proper meter.</I>

Mike Tyson cannot stand to lose...<br>
Not the cat calls, the jeers nor the boos...<br>
So he hurriedly lies....<br>
"I apologize...."<br>
And it's ear-biting now he eschews!

Bill Clinton said, "Lookie here, guys,<br>
That Paula is telling you lies.<br>
Return her brassiere<br>
And then come back here.<br>
Don't forget to bring back some French fries."

<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>Writerman</a> writes 07/02/97</h3>
When Tyson bit Holyfield's ear<br>
I imagine the headline seen here:<br>
"MIKE TYSON FALLS<br>
FROM A BITE ON THE BALLS<br>
ENDS BOTH BOXING AND SEXUAL CAREER.!"
<hr>
<h3>CB writes 07/01/97</h3>
The Vegas testosterone romp<br>
Saw his rival recrowned without pomp.<br>
Tyson bit off Ev's ear<br>
(Claims he "lost it," poor dear)<br>
And he's gone from The Champ to The Chomp!

<hr>
<h3>Lo and Behold shares a classic 07/01/97</h3>
Ther was a young man from Beijing<br>
Claimed he could make the Fat Lady sing<br>
He wafted his wide wand<br>
Down deep in her frond<br>
And unleashed a sizeable spring!
<p>
She peaked, shrieked, then beat her bare breast<br>
Her din declared hump me - dump me I'm truly impressed<br>
Though his dick in her dock<br>
Had caused her to rock<br>
No singing fluttered out of her nest
<p>
Perhaps I'll try to make that gal trill<br>
Not by causing a womberful spill<br>
But by tickling her fancy<br>
Then making her antsy<br>
When presenting my inflated bill!

<h4>by A. N. Wilkins</h4>
Their first statue -- Athena, a beauty --<br>
Made the rulers of Athens feel snooty,<br>
But while they were beaming<br>
And the marble was gleaming,<br>
The pigeons of town did their duty.<br>
<p>
"Evolution," observed Mr. Baer,<br>
"Labored ages with exquisite care,<br>
Leaving no raveled threads,<br>
To perfect a few heads.<br>
The others are covered with hair."<br>
<p>
Observed Darwin, "The mammals increased<br>
Thus producing a high type of beast<br>
When the primate was bred."<br>
Somehow Charles never said<br>
Whether he meant the ape or the priest.<br>
<p>
Curiosity caused as much strife<br>
As jealousy in Eve's botched life.<br>
Though she called him a skunk,<br>
Unless he got drunk,<br>
Adam never discussed his first wife.<br>
<p>
Said the Brass, "What a man did before<br>
Determined his place in the war.<br>
Thus a butcher, you'll find,<br>
Is always assigned<br>
A place in the Medical Corps."<br>
<p>
<h4>by Al Chaplin</h4>
In the sticks lives a lady named Bright<br>
With a face that's a horrible fright,<br>
But no fellow minds that --<br>

And it's fun when her pussy is tight.<br>
<p>
<h4>by Arthur Deex</h4>
Our late mayor, who was queer to the end,<br>
Caught AIDS from a casual friend.<br>
In the Times his obit<br>
Said "Mayor's funeral a hit --<br>
Ten thousand GAY MOURNERS attend"<br>
<p>
Evolution's a theory, my dear,<br>
That explains why we have eye and ear,<br>
Why we have upright walk<br>
And why we can talk --<br>
Big tits and appendix aren't clear.<br>
<p>
When God made the world in its prime,<br>
Like begat like every time.<br>
But then to temp fate<br>
He commanded: MUTATE --<br>
And that's why we're not all green slime.<br>
<p>
<h4>by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
A woman whom smoking had hooked<br>
With her doctor a visit had booked.<br>
When he asked with perplex<br>
If she smoked after sex,<br>
"I don't know," she said, "I've never looked."<br>
<p>
There are some girls boys think are real hot,<br>
And others that certainly are not --<br>
On these latter charts<br>
And the last to break hearts<br>
Are the Lee sisters -- Ug, Home, and Mot<br>
<p>
A slight-of-hand artist named Wares<br>
Can cut rabbits in half he declares.<br>
A remarkable trick<br>
That some people think sick,<br>
Though to others he's just splitting hares.<br>
<p>
A soldier who came from East Rockaway<br>
Had a mine blow his balls and his cock away.<br>
Kangaroo genitalia<br>
Grafted on in Australia<br>
Fixed him so he jumps broads a block away.<br>

<h4>by Clarence E Boyle</h4>
"Woman's twat," said a young man named Joe,<br>

An old gal standing by,<br>
Gave forth a big sigh,<br>
Then pursed her lips, "Is that so?"<br>
<p>
<br>
"Dont't put on a bra," said Bill Mace,<br>
As he looked at his wife in the face.<br>
"Just let your tits hang.<br>
I don't give a dang.<br>
They pull wrinkles out of your face!"<br>
<p>
The boobs on Mae Blount were a sight,<br>
And the way they stuck out was a fright.<br>
All the boys said, "Ho, Ho!<br>
But the boys didn't know<br>
She put her tits in the drawer at night.<br>
<p>
<h4>by Dylan Thomas</h4>
There was a young bugger called God<br>
Who put a young virgin in pod.<br>
This amazing behavior<br>
Produced Christ our Savior<br>
Who died on a cross, the poor sod.<br>
<p>
<h4>by Ed Potts</h4>
"The food we consumed," said McGoo,<br>
"Determined our health, how we grew;"<br>
"If we are what we eat,"<br>
Said his girl, Maguerite,<br>

A flat female, baring her chest,<br>
Confessed disdain for the usual test.<br>

An uninformed miss from John Day<br>
Was got in a family way.<br>
Her abdomen's rise<br>
Came as a surprise.<br>
She thought herself safe with a gay.<br>
<p>
A prudish old maid from Pauline,<br>
Was really disgustingly clean.<br>
She didn't like gin,<br>
Original sin,<br>
Or anything else in between.<br>
<p>
For CHRISTIAN and SCIENCE to fuse<br>
Would truly be lead story news.<br>
But it seems to me<br>
That it's got to be,<br>
Just one or the other, you choose.<br>
<p>
She can be deceptive and smart.<br>
She can have a treacherous beart.<br>
To think she is pure<br>
Is just horse manure,<br>
Because there is no CHERRY TART.<br>
<p>
<h4>by Laurence Perrine </h4>
Have you ever considered it odd<br>
That a supposedly self-declared God<br>
Should punish a grandkid<br>
For something his gramp did?<br>
It's proclaimed in the Bible, by God.<br>
(Exodus 34:6-7)<br>
<p>
<h4> by Martin Wellborn</h4>
A crusader, whose fling had been flung,<br>
Returned to his wife sweet and young;<br>
And discovered her with<br>
A rouguish locksmith<br>
Who was picking her lock with his tongue.<br>
<p>
A Kokomo cop named O'Toole<br>
Kept his gat in his shorts as a rule.<br>
One day this young clod<br>
Whipped out the wrong rod,<br>
And a gay crook cried, "Shoot me, you fool!"<br>
<p>
