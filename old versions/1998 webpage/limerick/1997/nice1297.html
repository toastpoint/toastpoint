An effeminate fellow from Lincoln<br>
One night did some serious drincoln.<br>
Met a gal, now his wife,<br>
Learned the true facts of life,<br>
And blesses the day he got stincoln!

A young novice and a nun from St Boyd<br>
Were confronted by a vampire called Lloyd<br>
The Nun, sister Ross<br>
Screamed, "Show him your Cross"<br>
The novice - (foot stamp) "I'm annoyed"!

The kids who are born are first rate,<br>
But they're fewer than ever, of late.<br>
There's no hanky-panky<br>
'Twixt Johnny and Frankie.<br>
It's because of that Heidie Vorce Raite.

A vampire, who, sadly, wore braces<br>
Bought large jars of blood in four cases<br>
Said, "These'll do fine<br>
While my fangs re-align<br>
And I'll not touch my stock of carcasses"

There once was a general called Powell<br>
Who shouldn't have thrown in the towel<br>
For he'd come tops in pollin' ...<br>
.. if they didn't make Colin<br>
Sound just like the end of your bowel!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Perhaps you should have an extra radio button for recycling a non-classic:

I wrote this before the last elections ... "</i>
<p>
<i>Hmmm....we will ponder on that...</i>
<p>
Three Utah men once were emplaned<br>
When their landing-gear fluid all drained<br>
They poured coffee and coke<br>
But the gear remained broke ...<br>
Till they peed, and safe landing attained!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, " ... and this one last February, when the incident happened. ... On the

other hand, what use would the extra radio button be to a guy who is about to go off the air? ..."</i>
<p>
To the Web I'm addicted, I fear<br>
Worse than smokers to smoking ... oh, dear! ...<br>
"The solution," friends shout<br>
"Is, cold turkey, log out" ...<br>
Au revoir, Toast Point, Happy New Year!

Today, I became very flustered, <br>
In finding a rhyme for a "bustard."<br>
Change its name to "canary."<br>
It's become necessary.<br>
I tried, but I can't cut the mustard.

I've checked my christmas card list<br>
And there is nobody on it I've missed.<br>
But, this card I had over<br>
Was really for Rover<br>
But the poor mutt's just died from a cyst!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A christmas message on a card from a dog-loving ex-friend."</i>
<p>
Is a non-vulgar fraction that much nicer<br>
Than Sage's Squeaky-Clean machine he calls a splicer?<br>
A fraction - I'm now wiser -<br>
Is, in part, a divisor<br>
And part of Sage's splicer's a de-vicer !
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Don't ask how this one came about- it's a long story "</i><hr>
<p>
<i>Toast Point shakes his head in bemusement.  "Oh, de-VICE-er...OK..."</i>
<p>
Said the divisor to the dividend in a fraction<br>
"Will you please get off my head before there's action"!<br>
Replied the dividend, "No retreat ,<br>
Remove your figure from my feet<br>
And get up here at once - it's a subtraction."

We have a Chris-Mouse who's not in a hurry,<br>
Unlike his relatives, he doesn't scurry.<br>
He's made of beads, red, clear, and green,<br>
He's the cutest thing you've ever seen.<br>
Santa's bringing him cheese, so don't you worry!

B.B. King was the Pope's Christmas ruse<br>

Gave John Paul his guitar ....<br>

His job he no longer graces<br>

Laugh and call him amateur.<br>
Cause he worked at the IRS of all places!

There once was a young cockerel<br>
Who to all of the hens was an eyeful<br>
He exuded moxie<br>
They all thought he was foxy<br>
But that didn't keep him from being the farmer's potful!

About Gold Star encashment (<a href=#alw>Al W.</a>)<br>

We'll be watching the mails...oh, you mean to send to <b>you</b>?

Who developed a passion for snails<br>
At night with a shout<br>
He'd chase them about<br>
With a long knife and cut off their tails!

I skidded and slid near a lake,<br>
Bent a birch and slammed on the brake.<br>
My car slid through the ice.<br>
Lacking air would suffice.<br>
The icing was frosting on cake.

Had two shillings, a dime<br>
3p, a centime<br>
And some crowns just to fill all the spaces!

Green socks and blue shoes and pink laces<br>

If Iraq played the U.S. at soccer<br>

There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
Why a great many dogs are called Rex<br>
But the number is minor<br>
Of those named Regina<br>
Amongst mutts of the opposite sex!

A vampire, who, sadly, wore braces<br>
Took temporary employment at Macy's.<br>
His ambition is to work<br>
As an IRS clerk -<br>
His bloodsucking background, the basis.

Tho' his plate overflowed (his third)<br>
Bill's dinner was meatless, I heard.<br>
To the fowl, now belated<br>
He felt almost related<br>
A lame duck soon-to-be jailbird!
