<h3>Al Willis writes 11/30/97</h3>
"No need to get nervous, O'Toole.<br>
I wanted to measure your tool."<br>
"When judging software,<br>
A yardstick ain't fair.<br>
You should start with this small six-inch rule."

<i>The poet comments, "About the wee bonnie Irish lass, it was the Scotsman talking about an Irish lass!"</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There was a young jockey called Moses<br>
Whose schlong hung right down past his toeses.<br>
As a finish-line trick<br>
He'd whip out his prick<br>
And win by a length (And two noses)!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Said the leatherman to his admirer<br>
"You're diminishing all my desire, sir!<br>
"The drool is ok,<br>
"But the hair's in the way,<br>
And I'm turned right off by a perspirer!"

A young woman from Southend-on-Sea<br>
Being seduced by a large chimpanzee<br>
Gave it a directive<br>
"You'll wear this protective<br>
And not make a monkey out of me!" 

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I've just remembered this one I "composed" over 15 years ago. 
Looking at the current crop shows that not much has changed - except that there seems to be a greater predeliction for sheep."</i>

There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
When a woman asks "Do you want sex?"<br>
That's kinda like askin'<br>
"Does Robbins know Baskin?"<br>
Or "Do you know if a Slinky can flex?"

Said a buxom young wench from Carlisle<br>
To her beaus - "you're cramping my style<br>
It is better, potentially<br>
To do it sequentially."<br>
They quickly put up a turnstile!
<p>
There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
Concerning atheists of opposite sex.<br>
To ask may seem odd<br>
But do they scream "God"<br>
When reaching a climax at sex ?

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'm not very keen to have "sex" twice. Any suggestions ?"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point just pondered it and came up with nothing - but likes the joke of the limerick.  Keep working on it!</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Why is that whip in your closet?<br>
Did someone place it in there by deposit ?<br>
With those leather boots<br>
and large rubber suits <br>
Were they used for some purpose? What was it?

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Not very naughty - but my preference (poetically speaking that is)is to underplay the explicit. You don't have to ram it home to obtain the right response !"</i>

<h3>The Best Left Hand In Town (lefty) shares a classic 11/26/97</h3>
A couple named Tom and Louise<br>
Performed lewd acts on their knees<br>
They rolled down the aisle<br>
Fucking doggy style<br>
Getting rug burns and a disease!

<hr>
<h3>Aify shares a classic 11/26/97</h3>
There once was a lady from Bude<br>
Who went to the theatre quite nude<br>
A man up front<br>
Said, "(Sniff) I smell cunt"<br>
Right out loud. Just like that - fucking rude!

<h3>Silly but Chilly-Willy writes 11/26/97</h3>
Now Hillary's known as a leader.<br>

And his wang is no longer a meter!!

So show us if it's so stupendous."<br>
But when he complied,<br>
She looked like she'd died,<br>
Gulped three times and gasped, "Heaven defend us!"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
"My microbiologist ex<br>
Had a weenie too teeny for sex,"<br>
Complained Sue with a sigh.<br>
"Perhaps I should try<br>
A macroeconomist next!"
<p>
A lady with multiple piercings<br>
Had exhausted her budget for earrings.<br>
She tried peddling her gash<br>
To generate cash,<br>
But was asked to do too many queer things.

<h3><a href=mailto:gcarson@inet-1.com>Trainman</a> writes 11/25/97</h3>

She said, "It smells ripe, but<br>
It hurts so to wipe it.<br>
I've a fortnight's shit  waiting to pass!"

<h3>Silly but Chilly-Willy writes 11/25/97</h3>
There was a man, Saddam Hussein<br>
Boy, was he fuckin' insane!!<br>
He hid the rockets<br>
And put bribe money in the pockets<br>
Of the inspectors so they would leave, heads turned away.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Let's light him up!!"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Wildman writes 11/25/97</h3>
Said the man-hating lesbian dyke<br>
As she sharpened her large butcher knife,<br>
"I'll find me a jock<br>
And cut off his cock<br>
And make him eat pussy all night!"

<hr>
<h3>FCA writes 11/25/97</h3>
Said the fiance of Mr. Keith Hutch<br>
"At last I've got him under my clutch,<br>
But if you tell Keith<br>
I'll lie through my teeth<br>
And swear I said crutch and not clutch!"
<p>
Said an aspiring actress from Knox<br>
'Remove your hand from under my frocks!"<br>
She was admonishing Hector<br>
That sly movie director<br>
And 20th century fox!

<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 11/23/97</h3>
Thanksgiving Day could be my favorite,<br>
And turkey with stuffing? I savor it.<br>
But the love of my life<br>
Is stuffing my wife!<br>
(Though I probably shouldn't belabor it!)
<p>
The holiday season seems early;<br>
It makes me feel hostile and surly.<br>
But I find that I might<br>
Relieve stress at night<br>
If I snuggle down where the hair's curly!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Easy listenin' for the holidays."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Best Left In Town writes 11/23/97</h3>
It seems there once was a young boy<br>
Played his foreskin like a new toy<br>
With a pull and twist<br>
Creamed over his fist<br>
Shit all over the bed in joy!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ramos@net-magic.net>Count Pornkula</a> writes 11/22/97</h3>
There once was a man from Miami<br>
Who loved ass-fucking his mammy<br>
And when he stuck it up her<br>
She sang for her supper<br>
The bitch could have won her a Grammy!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It'n it great to be a limerick composing genius???  I challenge anyone to challenge me in the battle of limerage...."</i>

<i>Welcome aboard, o shy one.</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 11/22/97</h3>
I hate all those sheep; read my lips.<br>
I helped farmer John with sheepdips.<br>
That farm's a latrine;<br>
Can't get my shoes clean.<br>
And since then I have hated lamb chips!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is almost un-naughty."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:kjd@myna.com>Canadian Priss</a> shares a classic 11/22/97</h3>
In Canada, Stern is a strange thing<br>
In the States, he is truly a real king<br>
His penis is small<br>
His guests have one ball<br>
But his cash register always goes ding-ding!
<hr>
<h3>Jean Chapeau writes 11/21/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Martin Luther King, so they say,<br>
Was an honest young man in his way.<br>
When his mam found the mess <br>
On the sheets, he confessed<br>
"Why, I had a dream today!"
<hr>
<h3>Silly but Chilly-Willy writes 11/21/97</h3>
I have got myself into a pickle<br>
'Cuz my dong is an icicle!<br>
I called over my girl<br>
To give me a whirl<br>
But she wouldn't because she's fickle! 

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Oh boy i'm nuts!!"</i>

<h3>Clitoris Chris shares a classic 11/21/97</h3>
There once was girl from New Zealand<br>

<h3>Jean Chapeau writes 11/19/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There once was a blushing young bride,<br>
Whose cunt was enormously wide.<br>
To give her good head,<br>
The man that she'd wed<br>
Needs a lantern, two ropes, and a guide!

<h3><a href=mailto:Awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 11/19/97</h3>
On the night that I saw Santa Claus,<br>
He was taking off my mother's drawers.<br>
He was quiet as a mouse,<br>
And when he left the house,<br>
The car that he drove wasn't Pa's.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 11/19/97</h3>
It's said Paula Jones thinks she has scored<br>
'Cos a leftward veer can't be ignored<br>
But a list to the port<br>
Couldn't stand up in court<br>
'Cos port's no more unique than starboard!

For me down in Afrique du Sud<br>
My sheep-shagging skills are no good<br>
With 4 feet and a half,<br>
I shag the Giraffe<br>
'Cause that's where it fits best and should!
<p>
Mary, she had a lamb little<br>
Its bones were quite fragile and brittle<br>
Except at the rear<br>
The one she loved dear<br>
She'd stroke it until it would spittle.
<p>
There was a young nun - Sister Hariot<br>
Who made love in her motorized chariot<br>
Too bad she got caught<br>
And to justice was brought<br>
They now call her Judith Iscariot!
<p>
Now as for young Little Bo-Peep<br>
At last she has found all her sheep<br>
From too many to choose<br>
She kicked out the ewes<br>
And the Rams she decided to keep!

<h3><a href=mailto:RenWa@aol.com>RenWa</a> writes 11/18/97</h3>
There was a young man from D.C.<br>
Who went to the mens room to pee.<br>
  While acting the fool<br>
  He pulled out his tool,<br>
Then pissed on himself and on me.
<hr>

<h3>Silly but Chilly-Willy writes 11/18/97</h3>
My friend's mom, boy, she's a whore<br>
But one day she pissed on the floor!<br>
For when the door bell rang<br>
She opened the thang<br>
And there was her gay love from the store!
<p>
<i>What?</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mbeen@swbell.net>Oddo Von Schlong</a> writes 11/18/97</h3>
The limericks you see on this page<br>
Some repulse while others engage<br>
But the <a href=#dent>last one I wrote</a><br>
Struck a discordant note<br>
In either the Toast Point or Sage?

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "?????????????"</i>
<p>
<i>Speaking for all gay people as Toast Point does, we find that the cheap shots towards members of our orientation get tiresome. Not offended, more of a rolling-eyes kind of thing. </i>
<hr>
<h3>Asscar Wild writes 11/16/97</h3>
It is said Mr. Gore is a bore - <br>
What he needs is a right little whore!<br>
He could try Lil Bo Peep<br>
Or I'd lend him my sheep<br>
And I'll bet he'd be begging for more!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There was a young lady named Anna<br>
Who sucked on a big green banana <br>
"How sour!", she said,<br>
"It's just like giving head<br>
To a man with his nuts in a spanner!"
<p>
Her name was young Anna Marie<br>
So proud of her virginity <br>
She was some piece of mutton<br>
With her pierced belly button<br>
But the ring leaked when she took a pee!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 11/16/97</h3>
This whore from the town of Biarritz<br>
Said, "I'm sporting two great big zits."<br>
"Well, sit on my knees;<br>
Let's give them a squeeze."<br>
(He thought that she said "two great big tits.")

This wee bonnie Irish young lass<br>
Confessed to the priest before Mass<br>
That she'd drunk to excess<br>
At an unknown address<br>
And what bloated her now wasn't gas!
<p>
Said the priest, "I absolve you, my dear,<br>
But now I'll confess what I fear<br>
If the child calls me Father<br>
'Tisn't Reverend, but rather<br>
The unknown address was right here!"

Two lawyers who met in Formosa<br>
Had sex in a field of mimosa.<br>
One jurist, a male,<br>
And the other, a quail.<br>
I'll bet that they did it sub rosa!

<h3>Chilly-Willy writes 11/14/97</h3>
There once was a girl from Montana<br>
Whose name was Dumb-ass Diana.<br>

With "Special Ham" and spit<br>
While on her vacation in Havana!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Havana is in Cuba for you geographically illiterate people!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Cyberhog writes 11/13/97</h3>
I wrote of the shagging of sheep<br>
And said it was all yours to keep<br>
For I'd rather have pork<br>
On the end of my dork<br>
Each night before I go to sleep!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "If this one doesn't provoke a response, I'll have to go back to shagging sheep!!!!"</i>

<p>
I once fell in love with a ram<br>
In bed, he was really "Hot Damn!"<br>
I'd nary a grizzle<br>
About his huge pizzle<br>
But it hurt like hell having his lamb.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Damn the pigs! I'll stick with common people and revert to sheep!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Biggus Dickus writes 11/13/97</h3>
If I had a girl named Delores.<br>
I'd surely control her clitoris - <br>
I'd rub it each day,<br>
And if she went astray<br>
I'd join the Vienna chorus!

My friend William's mom's a great fuck,<br>
And on Mondays, it's only a buck!<br>
No need to wine and dine,<br>
Just wait there in line - <br>
But I'm broke, so I'm Shit-out-of-luck!

To tell if shit's gay<br>
By the dent in the back end of it!"

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 11/13/97</h3>
The birds and the bees want to score,<br>
So they call up a known local whore.<br>
She sends up a bird<br>
And a bee (it's absurd),<br>
But that's what I think, and I'm four!

<h3><a href=mailto:lorraine@acun.com>Lonnie</a> writes 11/13/97</h3>
Now Hillary's known as a leader.<br>

When faced with this task, Bill responded in a flash,<br>
"The dog is hungry, I must go feed her..."

<P>In Montana, a cowboy named Vince<BR>
Took a Hollywood actor in tints<BR>
For a short horseback ride,<BR>
And a ewe they soon spied<BR>
With its head firmly wedged in a fence. </P>
<P>In a flash, Vince dismounted his filly,<BR>
Unzipped his fly, took out his willy,<BR>
Grabbed the ewe with a hoot,<BR>
Dropped a hoof in each boot,<BR>
And proceeded to shag the sheep silly! </P>
<P>When the spectacle came to an end,<BR>
Old Vince didn't even pretend<BR>
That this might be unique,<BR>
He just turned 'round to speak,<BR>
Saying, "Now it is your turn, my friend!" </P>
<P>So the actor, a little unsteady,<BR>
Dismounted on legs of spaghetti,<BR>
Gave Vince a quick glance,<BR>
Then hiked down his pants,<BR>
Stuck his head in the fence and said, "Ready!" </P>
