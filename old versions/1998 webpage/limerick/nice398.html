We have now acquired the domain name <a href=http://www.toastpoint.com>toastpoint.com</a>!  
(Gee, Eric, it only took you three years to get off your butt and register the name.)  You should be able to 
get to the limerick contest just by typing <i>toastpoint/limerick</i> in your browser address field.<hr>

<b>Thanks!</b> to all who have <i>clicked the button</I> (see bottom of page).  This past month, 
the click credits not only wiped out my bill, but <i>made</i> me money!  All right, just a couple 
of bucks, but still...  I love the idea of this web page being financially independent - keep it up!

I once met his little green man<br>
"From Mars," he said smiling, "You can<br>
Press my left ventricle,<br>
Tickle my tentacle,<br>
Or you can just shake my hand!"

He's developed a tumor,<br>
After surgery, he'll just have a bump!

I once met his little green man<br>
Who said ‘walk’ just as fast as you can<br>
But first look left and right<br>
Especially at night<br>
Or you’ll end up as flat as a pan!
<p>
Hush, hush and whisper who dares<br>
Christopher Robin’s not saying his prayers<br>
There’s a cat on the mat<br>
Hey, just fancy that!<br>
And there’s blood all the way up the stairs!

Which tickle and itch<br>
Like a son of a bitch;<br>
If you want some, they're down there for grabs.

While sitting there, twiddling his thumbs<br>
President Bill exclaimed, "I'm feeling kind of glum<br>
I'm even kind of numb<br>
This time Congres has overstepped its boundary<br>
They've made me tattoo GOVERNMENT PROPERTY-KEEP OFF on my tummy."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I think the President's private life is ONLY his and Hilary's business."</i>

His pulse is racing<br>
His eyes are tracing<br>
The path through the woods where that fox just went zooming.

Enjoying a trip on "Titanic"<br>
Were people quite megalomanic.<br>
There were humble poor, too<br>
Down on decks out of view,<br>
But everyone joined in the panic!
<p>I once met his little green man<br>
By the name of Eddie McMahon<br>
A bridge painter was he.<br>
Spraying paint, don't you see,<br>
He got more on himself than the span!
<p>You can only catch mad cow disease<br>
If you dine on their meat at your ease.<br>

<p>Oh, father! I have a confession!<br>
Said Maude, and I've learned a good lesson:<br>
Stealing stuff is great fun,<br>
Until you are done.<br>
What is hard is the full restitution!
<p>It's spring, and the flowers are blooming<br>
Our lawns and our shrubs we're a'grooming.<br>
I think it's quite nice<br>
Now that gone's all that ice<br>
And that snow and we're harvest assuming.

I once met this girl from down under<br>
Whose heritage split me asunder<br>
She from Alice Springs<br>
And Sydney. She sings:<br>
"I am Alice and Sydney's great wonder."

Humankind an ingenious lot?<br>
With our computers, I rather think not<br>
We shall cause our demise<br>
Armageddon arise<br>

<p>
<i>Another Y2K prophet, eh?</i>
<p>
A child of the universe – I’m one<br>
And living on earth sure is fun<br>
I take with much pride<br>
My free annual ride<br>
A colourful trip ‘round the sun!
<p>
‘Test tube baby’ - procedure quite new<br>
Some folk welcome and some folk eschew<br>
What have we right here?<br>
Embryo belvedere<br>
Described as a ‘womb with a view’!

Now the Pope, who has very old hips<br>
Can't bend down, on arrival, on trips<br>
But his urge to kiss ground<br>
Has remained so profound<br>
They instead raise the earth to his lips!

A myopic, but amorous rake<br>
Found his paramour's bodice was fake.<br>
He peered at her face,<br>

I have made a most dreadful mistake."

<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 03/15/98</h3>
"Gold Star" is the stuff of my dream,<br>
But its absence, awake, makes it seem<br>
That rhyming this stuff<br>
Is exceedingly rough,<br>
And the Sage concentrates on the theme.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Maybe a "blue star" for effort and persistence, oh Holy One???"</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage refuses to be swayed by entreaties, but encourages the poet to keep it up.</i>

I wrote, once, to SETI, last Spring,<br>
Believing I could find the thing<br>
Which eludes all who try,<br>
Scanning sounds from the sky,<br>
And the message from "THEM" I would bring!

<i>The poet comments, "This didn't win the SETI contest either, boo-hoo!"</i>

Never pass up a chance to shut up,<br>
Your audience will drink from your cup,<br>
When you pull them up short<br>
With an edited retort<br>
They'll wonder to what you are up!
<p>
Your psychic has planned out your weekend,<br>
Says not to go off of the deep end<br>
And buy things not needed<br>
His advice should be heeded<br>
So you won't be tempted to overspend!
<p>The cat in my hat is named "Bugsy,"<br>
She answers as well to "McFugsy,"<br>
When she's on the prowl<br>
All the other cats yowl<br>
Because "Bugsy" plays kissy and hugsy!
<p>Forgetting your troubles is doable,<br>
And paying the bills is eschewable,<br>
So don't lose your sleep<br>
Because some bleeping creep<br>
Tries to make your life ever un-screwable!

<h3>Sumaq writes 03/14/98</h3>
Brother Dennis the short did decree<br>
Listing years as B.C. and A.D.<br>
But this Christian most brief<br>
Erred in his belief<br>
For the Lord was born near 6 B.C!
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Brother Dennis the Short was a hero<br>
Counting years not from Rome of old Nero<br>
But from good J.C.<br>
And he erred, don't you see:<br>
He forgot to put in a year zero!
<p>
Well, B.C., A.D. and C.E.<br>
With B.C.E. all hope to be<br>
Ways to speak of past time,<br>
But at least for my dime,<br>
B.P. for them all's just as easy.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "C.E.=Common Era, B.C.E.=Before the Common Era (equivalents to B.C & A.D), B.P.=Before the Present."</i>
<p>As centuries go in a flow<br>
It's always a nice thing to know<br>
The last ended '99<br>
Which back then was quite fine,<br>
But ours will end in '00
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "read '99 as "nine-nine" and '00 as "oh-oh"."</i>

<i>The poet comments, "I wrote this last year when I was a freshmen (in high school)"</i>

And now he's the king of La Hoy!

Said Joe, with a sniff, "It's incredible!<br>

Most modern art seems waste of paint <br>
Only the crude dare voice complaint<br>

Schizophrenia beats eating alone,<br>
It's better than having a clone.<br>
But, if the Fois Gras<br>
Leads to twangy patois<br>
Then don't share your pone or your scone!
<P>
A bum asked me, "Give me a ten<br>
'Til payday." I asked him, "that's when?"<br>
He looked at me slow<br>
And said, "I don't know,<br>

"The rain, dear, IS falling."<br>
She beat him to death with a hammer.

<i>The poet comments, "By Laurence Perrine in A Limerick's Always a Verse"</i>
<p>A limerick that isn't obscene<br>

But, for once, here's a poem that is clean.

A hillbilly from West Virginia<br>

A pansy, a pimp and a ponce<br>
Drew their weapons in darkest Provence.<br>
The ponce and the pimp<br>
Came over all limp,<br>
And the pansy escaped, for the nonce.

One trusts it is no longer true<br>
That you do what you once used to do;<br>
And I hope it's a lie<br>
That these days you try<br>
To do certain other things, too.

I am proud to invoke the demise<br>
Of this fool, whom we all so despise.<br>
When the bell rings, we'll start<br>
To rip him apart;<br>
Bags I for his balls and his eyes!

St. Petersburg's summer is gay:<br>
Golden domes take the sun's bright array<br>

<i>The poet comments, "Lim'ricks-R-Me!"</i>
<p>
A leprechaun stopped me today,<br>
Shook my hand, smiled, then went on his way.<br>
He carried a sack<br>
Like a hump on his back,<br>
What was in it, he never did say!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Lot's 'o Irish luck, I hope!"</i>
<p>On Patty's Day, there's Sean O'Malley<br>
Guzzling Guinness alone in an alley.<br>
How much he can drink<br>
I really can't think,<br>
And O'Malley, he never keeps tally!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Too-ra-loo-ra-hic!"</i>
<p>
<i>Oh, yes, that drunken gay-unfriendly festival <b>is</b> coming up, isn't it?</I>

<h3>Beelzebub shares a classic 03/03/98</h3>
As the good ship Titanic went down,<br>
A lady in shimmering gown<br>
From her glass took a sip,<br>
Kept a stiff upper lip,<br>
And commenced, most discreetly, to drown.

If your light turns to red and you stop<br>
You won't care who hides back of a shop.<br>
But if you race on through<br>
Your next light may be blue<br>
Flashing "Stop!" on the top of a cop!

A railroad without any trains?<br>
A highway without any lanes?<br>
I cannot conceive<br>
Or even believe<br>
A Mensan without any brains!

<i>Toast Point comments that he has met many Mensans with brains, but no common sense.</i><hr>
