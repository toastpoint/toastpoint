<h3>Dolphin replies to the <a href=#sandman>Sandman</a> 08/31/96</h3>
What's become of our oblate little world?<br>
All we've known off great cliffs has been hurled<br>
Society is crumbling<br>
While governments are fumbling<br>
Human rationality dries shrivelled and curled.
<p>
Yet from this great catastrophe we'll grow<br>
And rebuild lives from the past we did know<br>
Great works we'll re-write<br>
From the darkness a new light<br>
And from our new pinnacle a limerick will flow!
<p>

The Republicans, at a convention,<br>
Had a theme they neglected to mention:<br>
"If you're pro-choice or gay,<br>
Black or poor -- STAY AWAY!!"<br>
(The "Big Tent" party can't stand dissension.)

There once was a world that was a bit of a dud,<br>
For people kept dying, leaving graves in the mud.<br>
And it only takes but a minute to think<br>
That the lies written in ink<br>
Can't hide the facts written in blood.

Poor old Dole, he sure needed a "bump"<br>
(Pollster-talk for a big ratings jump)<br>
So he brought back the Voodoo,<br>
The tax-cuts, the doo-doo;<br>
He just may persuade... Forrest Gump.

O.J. Simpson's the name: I can tell<br>
That you all hope that I'll rot in hell.<br>
But when it comes to the crunch<br>
You know, I've got a hunch<br>
I can fool Him upstairs just as well.
<p>
"I think the Republicans stink!"<br>
Said Bill Clinton, "and what's more, I think"<br>
"That Perot is a jerk,"<br>
"That his plans just won't work"<br>
"And that Dole is a chicken-heart fink!"

Did you see the Republiconvention?<br>
Many luminaries to mention<br>
Then Bob and Jack ran in-<br>
To Patrick Buchanan...<br>
A bone of Republicontention?

A goldfish, a cat and a puppy<br>
Belonged to Agnes O'Grady the yuppie - <br>
One night she entered her flat with her keys<br>
To find her cat postprandial and morbidly obese<br>
Said the cat,"For dessert I prefer sauteed guppy."!

There once was a man named Shawn,<br>
Who always awoke at dawn.<br>
Once he did not -<br>
he must have forgot - <br>
Now he is buried under the lawn!

<h3><a href=mailto:collins7@mail.idt.net>Collins7</a> writes 08/11/96</h3>
How to respond to confusion?<br>
Intellectually, or in collusion?<br>
Since I'm not very fast<br>
And repelled by the last<br>
I¹ll just roll my eyes and say "screw it".
<p>
Confusion is a matter quite spurious<br>
Inviting all, but the mentally curious<br>
Still, letting it go<br>
To go with the flow<br>
Is ridiculous fun but quite serious.

<h3><a href=mailto:collins7@mail.idt.net>Collins7</a> writes 08/09/96</h3>
Perverse limericks are quite snickerey - <br>
Please believe that I'm not persnikery - <br>
But saintly or knightly,<br>
Low or high as a kitely,<br>
I don't like to fun hickory dickery.
<p>
Hickory dickery dock,<br>
Fun around the clock,<br>
But, when lovers meet,<br>
In bed under sheet,<br>
It's better love tic and not talk!
<p>
<I>Toast Point is very confused by these two.</i>

<h3>His Peace writes 08/09/96</h3>
There once was a young swimmer named Jewel<br>
Who was so fat, her friends called her a fool<br>
One night she secretly went for a swim<br>
But alas! when she jumped in,<br>
She heard, "Now EVERYBODY out of the pool!"
<p>
There once was a fat young lady named Dup<br>
Who liked to lay back and eat beans from a cup<br>
She once slipped and fell down on her couch<br>
And the poor piece of furniture shouted, "OUCH!--<br>
"I'VE fallen and I CAN'T get up!!!"

There was a dog called Munch,<br>
Who ate bananas by the bunch.<br>
When he got fat,<br>
He said,"Fancy that!"<br>
"I'll have to cut down on my lunch."

<h3>Sandman writes a Palindromic verse 08/08/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Is it love for tears I shed?<br>
Forgives all, heart broken yet has it bled<br>
Bled it has, yet broken heart all forgives,<br>
Shed I tears for love...it is<br>

Happy Birthday to her whom begat thee<br>
A toast to her superiority<br>
To a woman of great strength<br>
Who put up at great length<br>
With the likes of yourself, young siree!

A man sipping double martinis<br>
Decided to slalom using jet skis<br>
With the glassses to his lips<br>
And two skis below his hips<br>
He bounced his way to the Florida Keys!
<p>
While going on summer vacation,<br>
Rodney King's dog practiced some perserveration<br>
He barked all night long<br>
Rod asked,"Why can't we just get along?"<br>
And with canine friend, shared his libation!
<p>
My VISA! Oh, no, it's expired!<br>
A car thief...my car is hotwired!<br>
I'll walk home flagrantly broke<br>
And then I'll see smoke,<br>
"My house!" and my boss says,"You're fired."
<p>
<I>Toast Point played with the meter of that one.</I>

It started as just an adventure -<br>
They said,"Leave it to the men..." , sure...<br>
Health care, Red Bone, and Whitewater<br>
Made being angelic a tall order...<br>
So... I talked to Eleanor Roosevelt without censure!

Two men rowed a rowboat a flitting.<br>
Each rowed with an effort befitting.<br>
One stood as he rowed,<br>
One sat as they flowed,<br>
For one of them couldn't stand sitting!
<p>
<I>The poet actually submitted that twice, and then submitted the following.</I>
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I'm sorry for this double entry - <br>
I'm left with feeling quite empty!<br>
My apostrophe, well<br>
Damn it to hell!<br>
Please take out my el and correct me!

A woman I adore above all others<br>
They'd all be like her if I had my druthers<br>
So here's to the best years of my life<br>
Spent in the arms of another man's wife<br>
....my mother's

<h3><a href=mailto:collins7@mail.idt.net>Barkley Collins</a> writes 08/06/96</h3>
There once was a poet not laureate<br>
Who sought to rope fame with his lariat - <br>
When said his wife Harriet<br>
"As critic, I'd bury it"<br>
He stretched out his strife with his lariat.

<h3><a href=mailto:WRDOERN@PATHCOM.COM>Bill Doern</a> writes 08/03/96</h3>
There was a young lass at the lakeside<br>
Whose diminutive waist was her great pride.<br>
She'd sashay the shoreline,<br>
Producing a low whine<br>
From the young bucks, all fixedly wide-eyed.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There was a young lass at the lakeshore,<br>
Her figure was classed as an eyesore.<br>
Whenever she'd walk<br>
The whole beach would talk<br>
And her condition in general deplore.
<p>
<i>Note to Mr. Doern: your other limericks were deemed <a href=naut896.html>naughty</a> 
despite your footnote.</i>

The choir at St. Agnes-on-Tweed<br>
Was missing a baritone lead,<br>
But by holding her nose<br>
Whilst she sang through a hose,<br>
A soprano met the choir's need!
