Writerman's limericks are cool<br>
They make me laugh like a fool<br>
But those of Bill Ron<br>
Just make me yawn<br>
He should stick with yanking his tool!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Let the war begin!"</i>

<i>Bill Ron opened our December contest with a

Imagine the naughty exoticism<br>
Of a car which can pump out a lot o' jism!<br>
From <a href="#nocturnal">Og's wit</a>, so ample,<br>
We got this example<br>
Of limerick auto-eroticism!

<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 11/27/96</h3>
Some verses on here are atrocious<br>
To call them limericks at all is precocious.<br>
Replacing good wit<br>
With offensive bullshit<br>
Would make Mother Theresa ferocious!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Entries the past couple of days have been very good, 
but there was a drought for a while.  
I waver between thinking meter-less verses 
should be banned or mercilessly ridiculing the bastards."</i><p>
<i>Toast Point replies, "We reward the good here, and leave punishing the 
bad to our readers...  We haven't had a good limerick 
flame war in a long time."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> shares a classic 11/27/96</h3>
There once was a man from Boston<br>
Who drove a little red Austin<br>
He had room for his ass<br>
And a gallon of gas<br>
But his balls hung out, and he lost them!

There once was a man from Dallas<br>
Who wore on his dick a large callous.<br>
He played with his tool<br>
Like a grinning big fool,<br>
And said "I beat, but do so without malice!"

My auto - an older edition -<br>
Started leaking without my permission.<br>
It was always at night<br>
And the fluid was white -<br>
Diagnosis:  nocturnal emission.

<h3>Trainman writes 11/26/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Miss Manners is so prim and proper,<br>
And her etiquette!  No one could top her!<br>
'Til she gave some advice<br>
About blowjobs and ice,<br>
Which proved a real show-stopper!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My first limerick ever!"</i><br>
<I>Toast Point applauds the newbie.</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 11/26/96</h3>
There once was a man from Tel Aviv<br>
Whose dick was so long, it was up his sleeve!<br>
Although  he was a very friendly man<br>
You must be careful when you shake his hand,<br>
Or a big handful of semen you will receive!
<p>
There once was a man from Mynot<br>
Who was nasty even as a tot - <br>
He would wipe his runny nose<br>
With the sleeves of his clothes<br>
And cover them all over with snot!

<h3><a href=mailto:rhubarb@nicoh.com>Rhubarb</a> shares classics from the Pentatette archives 11/25</h3>
<h4>by Billington</h4>
When visiting a farmer, Mae West<br>
     Lay down near a cow barn to rest. <br>
     When she brushed a cow's udder, <br>
     She would sleepily mutter, <br>
     "Just one at a time, boys, is best." <p>
<h4>By  Unknown</h4>
     Helen Keller's pussy grew tight,<br>
     As she rubbed her clit late at night. <br>
     She tickled that gland<br>
     With just her left hand, <br>
     And silently moaned with her right.   
 <p>
<h4>By David Miller </h4>
     There once was a girl named DeWitt,<br>
     Whose breast a thrown horseshoe had hit. <br>
     Said one of the gawkers, <br>
     "It lodged in her knockers  -<br>
     A ringer got caught in her tit!"
 <p>

     "My best," said a flasher named Leach, <br>
     "Were Nixon's inaugural speech, <br>
     The Pope's coronation, <br>
     And Grand Central Station. <br>
     My worst had to be a nude beach."

<h3>Ange shares a classic 11/24/96</h3>
There once was a man called Racine<br>
Who invented a fucking machine-<br>
Concave and convex,<br>
It would fit either sex<br>
With attractions for those in between!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:rhubarb@nicoh.com>Rhubarb</a> shares a classic 11/24/96</h3>
There was a young lady of Kent - <br>
The facts she did misrepresent.<br>

That her love was for sale,<br>
But they proved it was only for rent!

Exhibitionist Enos<br>
Oft exhibits his extra-large penis.<br>
Now I'll tell you a secret<br>
If you promise to keep it -<br>
He is ME - so please keep it between us!!!
<p>
<i>Gee, if it's that big...</i>
<p>
Thanksgiving is here, Lass and Lad -<br>
Raise your glass in a toast and be glad<br>
For the health and good cheer<br>
You've had through the year -<br>
And for all the fine fucking you've had!

A singer (and swinger) was Joyce -<br>
She sang opera-- as such was her choice.<br>
She'd take men to bed <br>
And, after giving them head,<br>
Gargle semen to strengthen her voice!

There once was girl from Magruder<br>
Who had an affair with her tutor.<br>
She told her dad<br>
And he got very, very mad<br>
When he found out the tutor had screwed her!

There once was a whore from Atlanta<br>
Who dreamed of tricking with Santa.<br>
She dreamed of the dick<br>
That hung on St. Nick,<br>
With garland and socks from the mantle!
<p>
There one was a man from Palm Beach West<br>
Who decided to give his dick a test - <br>
So he tied the append<br>
To a truck's rear end<br>
And it stretched all the way to Key West!

The Discovery Award just may go<br>
To fair Sandy from fair San Diego<br>
She's discovered that sex is<br>
Much more fun in a Lexus -<br>
And today she discovered... she's prego!
<p>
An impeccable fellow named Becker<br>
Had an impeccable pecker<br>
Because everyone loved it<br>
He cared not where he shoved it...<br>
Now poor Becker sees a pecker-checker!!!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">

When one wants to purchase a teddy,<br>
Best be sure that your lover is ready.<br>
Shown too much, too quickly<br>
He or she may grow sickly<br>
When age-ed, infirm, or unsteady!
<p>
It's twenty-five minutes past three<br>
In the morning and silly old me,<br>
Wakened rudely when she snored,<br>
Sits in front of my keyboard -<br>
Thinking: sex is never for free!
<p>
<i>Toast Point breaths a sigh of relief.  "Og, show these youngsters below how it's done!"</i>

<h3>SiNC writes 11/15/96</h3>
Said a nun to the Mother Superior<br>
Are my breasts inferior?<br>
I know that I like them<br>
But would you try them?<br>
Said Mother Superior, "Everyone come and try.  The more the merrier."

<h3>Bill Ron writes 11/15/96</h3>
Ruba Dub Dub<br>
There was this man sailing his sub<br>
He was gay and friendly at every shore town<br>
But got rather confused when asked <br>
Do you in your sub ever go down?

<h3><a href=mailto:cmedl@nortel.ca>Chris Medl</a> writes 11/15/96</h3>
There once was a young man named Chris, and<br>
For him drinking was a part of his plan.<br>
He liked to drink beer<br>
'Til his vision t'weren't clear<br>
(Makes it harder to go take a piss, man!)

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I like to drink beer.  "</i>

<hr>
<h3>Joe Schmoe writes 11/15/96</h3>
There was a young man named Mick<br>
Who wanted a refined Lady to suck his dick<br>
While seated next to her a bar<br>
She unzipped his pants saying "I know who you are"<br>
And placed her elegant lips on his prick.
<p>
<i>Work on your meter, Joe.</i>
<p>
Sir Johnny used to drive a big truck<br>
With the ladies, he had all the luck<br>
But when Cindy Lou <br>
Became pregnant with two<br>
He ran off shouting "Oh what the fuck."

the dead whore in a cave has been banned.</i>

Roosted three owls, a duck, and a canary!

To everyone, we must be attentive,<br>
Yet same-sex marriage seems sans incentive,<br>
But it is a new age,<br>
So good luck to the Sage - <br>
Hope Wumpus is not anal-retentive!

<I>Oh, ha ha.</I>

Descartes sits down for some beers<br>
Between two chaps who are queers.<br>
As one grabs at his dink<br>
He declares "I don't think"<br>
And promptly Rene disappears!

A queer bloke from outback Australia<br>
Was obsessed with his own genitalia.<br>

With it all hanging out<br>
Nicely trimmed with a twig of azalea!

'Though <a href=#bigot>bigots may raise up a rumpus</a>,<br>

<h3><a name="bigot">Jim</a> writes 11/01/96</h3>
Same-sex marriages just don't do it,<br>
For marriage is two as a unit.<br>
When the wedding is done<br>
Two can't become one<br>
Unless the parts fit so's to screw it.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Social commentary seems to be my thing the last couple of months.  Must be the election year fever."</i>

Having just become engaged to his Wumpus, Toast Point eyes the poet balefully.
