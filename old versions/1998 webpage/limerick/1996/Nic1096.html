<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A Yalie lawyer named Hillary C.<br>
Was arrested for trying to be<br>
A substitute president,<br>
Not merely a resident,<br>
Of hubby Bill's menage-erie!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a cybergeezer reject. Shows what he knows!"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:101526.1610@compuserve.com>Kalkbrenner</a> writes 10/28/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A girl who displayed adiposity<br>
Incited a man's animosity.<br>
In the end, it was night<br>
When the man, out of spite,<br>
Committed a lipid atrocity!
<p>
<h3>and the following, entitled "Ough!"</h3>
There once was a man called McGough<br>
Who, out walking, tripped over a bough.<br>
He said that, although<br>
His leg hurt enough,<br>
He didn't mind limping home to Middlesbrough.
<p>
<I>Enow?</I>

<hr>
<h3>Mr. Wong writes 10/24/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
At a diner in greater Van Nuys<br>
Bill stumped, fabricating his lies<br>
"Trust me and my plan,<br>
I'm your number one man,<br>
Are you gonna finish those fries?"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:johnyrandy@prodigy.com>Johnyrandy</a> writes 10/22/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
 I pray for an internet ban<br>
On limericks that don't even scan,<br>
But merely abuse<br>
Dear Erato, our muse.<br>
T'were best they were flushed down the can!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Limericks that don't meet the test of meter or rhyme should be banned."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point agrees, but in fairness, posts them anyway.  Once posted, other poets can ridicule the sender with their own perfectly-scanned limericks.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Paul Yeung writes 10/22/96</h3>
There once a girl named Mary,<br>
Who wanted to go on a ferry.<br>
The ferry turned over,<br>
And never went back to Dover,<br>
And it was the end of  Mary!

<hr>
<h3>Ivytong writes 10/22/96</h3>
There once a boy named Sam<br>
Who likes to eat meats and hams<br>
When it was time for lunch<br>
The boy ate so much<br>
And his stomach hurt
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I like it."</i><br>
<I>The Sage responds, "But what about the last rhyme?"</I>
<hr>
<h3>Lem R. Ick writes 10/21/96</h3>
Clinton or Dole - who knows?<br>
Both are really big foes!<br>
Just make your selection - <br>
Neither's perfection -<br>
Or try your luck with Perot!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:RenWa@SeaNet>RenWa</a> writes ...</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Bill Clinton, he really pushed NAFTA.<br>
He pleaded, "We `hafta. we hafta."<br>
  But, H. Ross Perot<br>
  Kept saying "No, No."<br>
Insisting it will mean the `shafta.'.
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 10/21/96</h3>
Our leaders, they really have nerve.<br>
They bob, they weave, and they swerve.<br>
  But, come the election<br>
  They ooze with affection;<br>
Let's limit how long they can serve!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:dj@maji.com>Emilie Major</a> <a name="emilie">writes</a> 10/19/96</h3>
There once was a girl named Sue<br>
Who loved to suck on her shoe.<br>
She sucked and she sucked - <br>
OH MY!!  What luck!<br>
'Cause it tasted like Mountain Dew!

<hr>
<h3>Boy Pilot writes 10/15/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
While shopping for jewelry at Tiffany's<br>
She had one of her frequent epiphanies.<br>
She just took off her dress<br>
And with skill and finesse<br>
Said "The Frogs" from the Greek, Aristiphanes.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Your three-syllable last words for first lines make it tough, but it's a fun way to spend a morning."</i>
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Are all of those Usenet posts true?<br>
"Cause if so, I'll have nothing to do<br>
With the Globe or the Star - <br>
USENET's better by far -<br>
And I'll save a few bucks for some brew!
<p>
Consider the commonplace cantaloupe<br>
Engaged, as it is, to an antelope.<br>
Lest friends snicker and smile,<br>
They must wed in great style.<br>
Now you know why the cantelope can't elope!
<p>
Robert Dole - has he smiled even once?<br>
As he stammers and grumbles and grunts?<br>
With a wife like his Lizzie,<br>
I'd be all in a tizzy,<br>
Give a speech, and then off to the hunts.
<p>
To write a political limerick<br>
Needs some rhymes that just do not exist.<br>
So I'll just change the form<br>
From its usual norm,<br>
And then hope that you will not be ... annoyed.
<p>
<I>Hmmm...</I><p>
<h4> When your Clergyman's Coming to Call</h4>
You're always afraid you will blow it,<br>
If your house isn't ready to show it.<br>
But if God should get keen<br>
On your house being clean,<br>
HE'd inspect it, and you'd never know it.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 10/15/96</h3>
This Salk, who was famous, named Jonas,<br>
Promised wealth and a title and bonus<br>
  To these monkeys called Rhesus<br>
  Who agreed, "You can lease us,"<br>
"But don't come on strong like you own us."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:oolong@pobox.com>Oolong</a> writes 10/12/96</h3>
The <a href=instruct.html>instructions</a> that Toast Point produces<br>
Have poets all running for nooses -<br>
Verse two and verse three,<br>
Are quite fine, don'cha see,<br>
But the first and the last will raise bruises!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Okay, so my rhymes aren't perfect either . . . but gee whiz, Toast Point, they are the instructions and they ought to be perfect form. :-S"<br>
Toast Point sniffs back tears and will take another look at the instructions. </i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:tim@raptor.lpl.arizona.edu>Tim</a> writes 10/11/96</h3>
These Limericks Clean are quite sparse<br>
And mostly do not raise a laugh<br>
This one ain't the best<br>
It's as bad as the rest<br>
As for Gold Stars, it ain't worth a half!
<p>
<i>Self-fulfilling prophecy...</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ronl@travel-net.com>Bobby</a> writes 10/11/96</h3>
To write a political limerick,<br>
It's not that easy for me,<br>
Because I wish,<br>
That I was a doggie,<br>
And most polititians were trees.
<p>
<i>Hee-hee-hee!</i>
<hr>

Dear Toast Point: your contest is neat.<br>
Your meter is quick on its feet,<br>
But please take the time,<br>
To learn how to rhyme,<br>
Or prepare for your fame to be fleet.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Pedantry Rules!"</i>
<p>
It's not that I don't like your thought,<br>
But a limerick ought to be taut,<br>
And your verse, though instructive,<br>
Is counterproductive.<br>
Let's take it right out to be shot.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Money will buy you a fine dog, but only love will make it wag its tail.<br>
                                      --Kinky Friedman"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point shoots an arch look at Oolong, "Which verse are you referring to, o complaining one?"</I>

<h3>Canadian Spirit writes 10/10/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The little you do with your brain<br>
Is certainly causing you pain<br>
It's quite plain to see<br>
That counting to three<br>
Is causing those spasms again!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "For those who periodically suffer from brain f*rts."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:wrdoern@pathcom.com>Bill Doern</a> writes 10/09/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
The Pastor would never admit<br>
That he suffered an atrophied wit.<br>
He thought that a tumour<br>
Was a call for bright humour.<br>
Egads, good grief, what a twit!
<hr>
<h3>Billy shares classics 10/09/96</h3>
While watching a plane fly upside down,<br>
I spotted the  face of a clown,<br>
It was funny and hairy,<br>
And also quite scarey,<br>
And its mouth had a smile, not a frown!
<p>
I once knew a guy called old Jed,<br>
 He looked like he'd never been fed,<br>
 His legs were so skinny,<br>
 That he looked like a ninny,<br>
And I knew that real soon he'd be dead.

<hr>
<h3>Canadian Spirit writes 10/09/96</h3>
The elephant's elongated nose<br>
Should not be considered a hose.<br>
It's really much more<br>
Than a thing that gets sore<br>
When an mammoth-sized cold has arose.

<hr>
<h3>Bobby writes 10/09/96</h3>
That Oprah! She's fat or she's skinny,<br>
She's forever trying to lose weight,<br>
But because she likes food,<br>
She's in a bad mood,<br>
I'm afraid this must be her fate.
<p>
<I>Rhyme, Bobby, rhyme!</I>
<hr>
<h3>Toast Point writes 10/3</h3>
Limericks so clean, they're squeaky<br>
Have been timid, or just a bit sneaky<br>
For the month of October<br>
No clean one's come over<br>
'Cept this one (and it's just a bit creaky!)
