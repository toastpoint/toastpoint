<h3>CB writes 07/29/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Our reality's getting too stark<br>
And Western Civ's crawling towards dark!<br>
You can only say, "Cripes!"<br>
When bombs made of pipes<br>
Blow up in Centennial Park!
<p>
With these psychos now hogging the news --<br>
Energizing our ACLUs --<br>
I say:  "Round 'em up, Newt 'em!<br>
Take 'em out and shoot 'em!<br>
I'm abandoning liberal views!!!"
<p>
<I>The Sage knows what CB means.</I>

<h3>His Peace writes 07/26/96</h3>
It seems pretty odd that sometimes <br>
Public telephone booths accept dimes...<br>
Maybe the little men inside <br>
Have nowhere else to hide,<br>
So they're saving space for more dumb rhymes!
<p>
Have you ever wondered why on TV,<br>
Pretty girls come across as quite easy - <br>
All it takes is some dumb joke<br>
And you've got them under your yoke -<br>
In real life, they'd smack you quite silly!!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
If you ever go to a really small zoo,<br>
Be weary of the keepers, please do -<br>
'Cos if the animals, they say, don't feed,<br>
And their advice you refuse to heed,<br>
The feed might end up being you!!
<p>
When watching this year's Summer Olympics<br>
I really can't help but think this:<br>
"Is it just me, or is Atlanta<br>
So bad that jolly good Santa<br>
Won't give them any presents for Christmas?!"
<p>
When traveling to New York the other day,<br>
I met a funny-looking man on the way.<br>
I asked him, "Sir, what's wrong?"<br>
He replied, "My story's real long,<br>
And it's making a fortune on Broadway!"
<p>
There once was a young man from LA<br>
Who swallowed a drink the wrong way - <br>
After sneezing and coughing mildly,<br>
He started burping quite loudly,<br>
And when he finished, "Oops!," was all he could say!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a young girl named Betty<br>
Who dreamed she was in the Serengeti.<br>
Soon the lions gave chase,<br>
And 'cos she couldn't keep pace,<br>
Her bed was strewn with human confetti!!
<p>
If you ever see a Banglee say "hi",<br>
'Cos they're scarce, and you know why?<br>
They fight lions and are beaten<br>
And are subsequently eaten,<br>
Plus they rarely get a chance to say "Bye."
<p>
Have you ever wondered why this cool joint<br>
Is called (of all names) "Toast Point"?<br>
A place named after burnt bread<br>
Can make one go brain-dead<br>
And that's why I can't finish this (joint). . .
<p>
Excuse me, All-Powerful, Great Sage of Toast Point<br>
You should regularly post poems at this joint<br>
'Cos if you're really as good as you seem,<br>
We could get together as a team,<br>
And really "All-Powerful, Great Sage" you appoint!
<p>
<i>The Sage judges poems and leaves the writing to those who submit.</i>

<h3>CHRISADAM writes 07/24/96</h3>
There once was a man from Algiers<br>
Who had one too many beers - <br>
They found him on his belly <br>
With a can full of jelly<br>
And peanuts in his ears!
<hr>
<h3>Frode... shares a classic 07/24/96</h3>
A real fine bird is the pelican - <br>
Its bill holds more food than its belly can!<br>
It stores in its beak<br>
Enough food for a week<br>
And I don't understand how the hell it can!
<p>
<I>The submitter comments: Heard on TV on the show "Columbo".  Toast Point asks generally if anyone remembers the limerick that Marianne (Christine Baranski) wrote on the fly during an episode of "Cybill"?  The last line was "The zebras are running amok.".</I>

<h3>Travis Wyatt writes 07/23/96</h3>
There once was a dragon named Ned.<br>
He loved to eat crackers in bed.<br>
He laid on a crumb,<br>
and felt very dumb.<br>
If he were a dog, he'd shed.

My calico kitty, Sabrina,<br>
Never once, in her nine lives, has seen a<br>
Mouse, mole or rat;<br>
She's a spoiled, sheltered cat<br>
Who prefers salmon mousse and Wheatena!
<p>
<I>The poet comments that she saw Toast Point's photo of  
<a href="../../gifs/leopold.jpg">Leopold</a> and decided to send one of her "cat limericks" to the Squeaky-Clean
contest.  Sabrina is one of her four cats, all litter-mates, who just turned four years old July 22.  Like Leopold, they all have long hair and interesting dispositions.</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:rcorlies@post.kosone.com>Youngbeard</a> writes 07/16/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The marriage of Charles & Di<br>
Will soon no longer apply!<br>
The divorce date's been set <br>
And all criteria met<br>
To dissolve their betrothal tie.
<p>
It was Bertha they gave as a name<br>
To the storm on the east coast that came.<br>
People left in a hurry,<br>
Fearing its mighty fury<br>
But compared to some, she was tame!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:acole@mustang.uwo.ca>James Satoshi</a> writes 07/15/96</h3>
There was once a young scholar from Rhodes<br>
who prayed to learn all that was `knowed'.<br>
God granted his desire;<br>
this man became inspired,<br>
causing his head to quickly explode.
<hr>
<h3>Sandman writes an epic 07/15/96</h3>
In truth, I've taken a moment to pause<br>
To ponder burnt bridges and closed doors.<br>
Truth was an illusion,<br>
My life wrought with confusion,<br>
And women were mostly the cause.
<p>
I know to be loved is better than any<br>
Fortune in fame or in penny,<br>
But you'll get nothing but strife<br>
With two women in life,<br>
In fact I think it's two too many!
<p>
A weight has been lifted from these shoulders of mine - <br>
Detached emotions no longer entwine.<br>
One thing I do know - <br>
From here I shall grow<br>
And live my life truly as mine.
<p>
Indeed I've been up and been down,<br>
Sharing smiles but more often a frown,<br>
But from this slumber I'll wake<br>
And these shackles I'll break<br>
And emerge playing the well-known clown.
<p>
All of the stars in the night<br>
Now appear alike at first sight,<br>
But with their illuminating beams<br>
Come new hopes and dreams<br>
Of finding the whitest of light
<p>
<i>After much consideration, the Sage placed the penultimate verse on the 
<a href=naut796.html#sandman>Naughty Limericks</a> page.</i>
<p>
So no more will I rage<br>
As I pen my last page<br>
And the last thing to say<br>
As these words fade away<br>
Is adieu from Sandman to Sage.

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A traveller hailing from Parma<br>
Fell foul of the new Dhali Lama -<br>
On his way home again,<br>
He had no end of pain<br>
Attributable to bad karma!
<p>
A teddy with sticky-out ears<br>
At the picnic had too many beers - <br>
He got drunk as a wretch<br>
And his seams got so stretched<br>
He was ostracized by his peers!
<hr>
<h3>Emily writes 07/07/96</h3>
There once was a doctor named Jane<br>
Who thought her job was a big pain.<br>
She preferred liberal arts<br>
To red tape and clogged hearts<br>
And embraced English lit once again.
<hr>
<h4>Stan, how many times are you going to submit the "roo" limerick?  Look at the bottom of this page!</h4>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:storyvil@iinet.net.au>Herkin</a> writes 07/06/96</h3>
In Canada lives my beloved Aunt -<br>
She works in a food processing plant.<br>
They've got Mountains of Gammon<br>
And Rivers of Salmon- <br>
They eat what they can, and can what they cant't

<hr>
<h3>Sandman writes angst-filled limericks 07/05/96</h3>
Life is but a strange illusion,<br>
Full of false hope and delusion.<br>
The only way to stay sane<br>
And avoid all the pain<br>
Is to live your whole life in seclusion.
<p>
I feel that I'm all lost at sea,<br>
The waves keep crashing on me.<br>
I need some light<br>
To shatter this night<br>
For darkness is all I can see.
<p>
Now I've come to a fork in the road<br>
No more can I carry this load<br>
A decison to make - <br>
Which path I should take<br>
If only the right way I was showed.
<p>
It's hard to know what to choose<br>
Either way, I fear, I will lose<br>
For what goes around<br>
Does come around<br>
In the end we all get our dues.
<p>
All the cards have been laid on the table - <br>
I would play if I only were able<br>
But my hands I have tied,<br>
Sad tears I have cried<br>
I can't play when feeling unstable
<p>
The winds of change are blowing my way<br>
As alone in the world I do lay<br>
Against all my will<br>
I'm feeling the chill<br>
The sun has turned cold today

<h3>Stargazer writes 07/05/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Let's move <a href=nice696.html#langston>Langston's poem</a> from this page<br>
To the "naughty", O Toast Point and Sage!<br>
It's not just the sentiment<br>
That might cause resentiment,<br>
But the "s-word" for eyes under-age!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Stargazer is an old radical too, but mellowed..."  
Toast Point decided to 
blip the offending word out instead, as he did Langston's comment.</i>

<hr>
<h3>Sandman writes 07/04/96</h3>
"I don't understand you" I say in despair,<br>
"Your thoughts I'd like you to share."<br>
But I get no reply,<br>
And now I know why,<br>
For it's into the mirror I stare.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mrsmnch@aol.com>The Ang</a> writes 07/03/96</h3>
A trio of sorrowful hounds<br>
Was brought in to water the grounds.<br>
Said the man down in hell,<br>
"They've done their job well,<br>
I hope no one ELSE down here drowns."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A friend of mine and I wrote this one in a matter of 
moments for a ninth grade writing assignment, and I've never forgotten it!"</I>

<hr>
<h3>Stan Lee writes 07/03/96</h3>
An Australian "Roo" from down under,<br>
Which I sighted one day made me wonder,<br>
Though she was no slouch,<br>
Her marsupial pouch,<br>
Seemed to be getting rotunder!
