Through her dress you'll see tit<br>
And just a wee bit<br>
Of pudenda, which she's painted scarlet!

And with passion, his member, she grips<br>
With climax anew<br>
He says “Ooo ooo ooo ooooooo!”<br>
Pretty much like a cow with no lips!

I married this wonderful filly<br>
And since then I aint sunk my willy<br>
But I have a surprise<br>

"Would you boys like to tear off a piece?"
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

In claiming that this is a ruse.<br>

Wears pants with a zipper that's loose!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wrote this one the day after her deposition was made, back in February.  
I am also submitting a couple of others written more recently."</i>
<p>In the ol' Arkansas cabbage patch,<br>
Horny Bill was hoping to catch<br>
A cute southern doll<br>
Who'd say with a drawl<br>
"C'mon, lemme show ya mah snatch!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Just wrote this one in mid-March as the news about 'ol Bill caused me to reflect on Gennifer Flowers et. all. of yesteryear."</i>
<p>She seemed to be just a dumb filly<br>
To the eyes of old silly Willy.<br>

Kiss her, and grope Willey-nilly!

Just two pints of Guinness, that's it<br>
That gives the Irish their wit<br>
Or a wee dram of whiskey<br>
Makes their tongues frisky<br>
Much more and they're all full of shit!

"Willey Whacks Willy's Willie"<br>
As headlines would be silly.<br>
If what Starr knows<br>
Goes "Thar She Blows"<br>
Willie won't be laughing, will he?

Let's jog our thinking a bit.<br>
The one they should neuter<br>
Is the one whose "tooter"<br>
Keeps him in deep shit!

The emissions of which were volcanic!

From a roll in the hay,<br>
And that's how it goes, c'est la vie.

The nudists had lain in the sun<br>
Ever since the day's heat had begun.<br>

There was a grey wolf named Clinton<br>
Quite good at unzipping and hintin'<br>
Told a young gal to kiss it-<br>
She tried to dismiss it-<br>
Seems she'd never seen such a bent one!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sad,I wrote this in 1995. 
I am psychic,but am afraid will be called in Jones v Clinton!"</i>
<p>When Billy first heard of the draft<br>
He toked him a weed and laughed.<br>
"I'll tell 'em I'm dead-<br>
Or like mamma said<br>
I'll escape in a Whitewater raft!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Twinkle, twinkle Mr. Starr"</i>

A hillbilly way down in Texas<br>
Was seen out driving a Lexus.<br>
Said "I got it last night<br>
From a cowboy who likes<br>
The way my hard body flexes!"

A hillbilly from Carolina<br>
Married a cute girl from China.<br>
She likes to screw<br>
The way dogs do,<br>
So he spends lotsa time behind her!
<hr>
<h3>Teresa writes 03/12/98</h3>
I once met this girl from down under<br>
Whose thighs rattled like thunder!<br>
Her butt was so big<br>
It looked like two pigs<br>
In a Viking's big bag of plunder!
<p>
You can only catch mad cow disease<br>
If you get down on your knees<br>
And try to make butter<br>
By sucking her udder<br>
Till milk's past your eyes, you see.     
<p>
I once met a little green man<br>
He said he was Green Day fan.<br>
The size of a pint,<br>
But I saw a Green Giant<br>
When he unzipped his little green pants!
<hr>
<h3>Marvin  writes 03/12/98</h3>
I once met a little green man<br>
With his little green dick in his hand.<br>
He pulled on his meat<br>
Till it grew to 3 feet,<br>
And I was sure jealous of that!
<p>
Said an intern to President Clinton<br>
(who was only subtlely hintin'),<br>
"You used no protection,<br>
No, it's not an infection...<br>
But some baby boots I'll be knittin'!"
<p>
"Dear Father, I have a confession...<br>
I'll start with my favorite impressions<br>
Of Barbra and Cher<br>
And Garland so fair,"<br>
Said Joe at his therapy session!

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 03/12/98</h3>
A nun for the first time was kissed<br>
And the passion she couldn’t resist<br>
As her lips opened wider<br>
And his tongue deep inside ‘er<br>
Screamed “O Gosh, that’s my ‘G’ spot you’ve missed!"
<hr>
<h3>Shagnasty writes 03/12/98</h3>
Bill felt like a little out 'n insky<br>
So he called in Miss Monica Lewinsky<br>
He left a little drip<br>
Just  below her lower lip<br>
Right on her chinny chin chinsky!

<p>
Ol' Bill wanted to give Monica a try<br>
Then he hastily unzipped his fly.<br>
He whitewashed her tonsil<br>
And then gave her his council<br>
Saying "It's okay to tell a little white lie."
<hr>
<h3>Lars writes 03/11/98</h3>
This Toast Point website is grand!<br>
Why it's popular I can understand.<br>
Although triple X..<br>
Gets more hits, I guess.<br>
It's hard to surf with just one hand!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I thought I'd write about this website for my first submission.
"</i>
<p>
<i>Self-referential is always fun!</i>

<hr>
<h3>Steve writes 03/11/98</h3>
I once met this girl from down under<br>
Who made a terrible blunder...<br>
Her vibrator shorted,<br>
Shot fire, smoked and snorted,<br>
And her very first orgasm stunned her!
<p>
While sitting there, twiddling his thumbs<br>
Waiting for his woman to come,<br>
His dick wouldn't do it,<br>
So he fin'ly said "screw it!",<br>
And he got her off with his tongue!
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Oh, father! I have a confession!<br>
Hope it doesn't cause you depression.<br>
I applied as intern<br>

My lips made quite an impression!

<h3>Blowcephus writes 03/11/98</h3>
While having sex on Titanic,<br>
Wy woman started to panic.<br>
When she saw the berg,<br>
I thought she meant my worm<br>
When she said, "My God, it's gigantic!"
<p>
I once met his little green man - <br>
His dick had a big, purple glans.<br>
He had blue balls,<br>
And when he jacked off,<br>
He got orange cum on his hands!
<p>
You can only catch mad cow disease<br>
By eating contaminated meat,<br>
Or if you try to screw<br>
Ol' Bessie Sue<br>
When she's not in the mooooood (in heat)!

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 03/11/98</h3>
I’ve a theory I think is irrefutable<br>
Although you may think it’s disputable<br>
If the Sphinx were a mammal<br>
He would jump on the camel<br>
Then his smile would be wide - not inscrutable!
<p>
The Sphinx is not one to forget<br>
And the reason he smiles, I will bet<br>
He still knows to this day<br>
In a wry kind of way<br>
Only ONE hump the camel did get!
<hr>
<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 03/10/98</h3>
Said an intern to President Clinton<br>
"Oomph blobin de glabesh mif flinton."<br>
"That's all cock and bull.<br>
Your mouth is too full<br>
To make sense," said the Prez. "Shlockar jhinton!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Figure that one out!"</i>
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I once met this girl from down under<br>
The President's desk. You might wonder<br>
Would scandal have blown up<br>
If Clinton would own up?<br>
Ken Starr would have nothing to plunder!<hr>

There once was a whore named McGuinn<br>
Who often drank too much gin<br>
Which explains her soiled dresses<br>
Her disheveled tresses<br>
And the cum dripping off of her chin!

She smiled and she felt a lot gladder<br>
When the boys did their best to unclad 'er.<br>
Now she loved to revel<br>
And act like the devil,<br>
And, what is more, she was badder!
<hr>
<h3>Possum writes 03/09/98</h3>
A pervy young fellow named Peter<br>
claimed to be the best pussy eater.<br>
Said, "I'll lick a puss<br>
with a long, hairy bush,<br>
But snackin' on a shaved one is neater."
<hr>
<h3>Wildman writes 03/09/98</h3>
My sanity may be debatable,<br>
And some may think me undatable,<br>
It could be I'm crazy,<br>
And a little bit lazy,<br>
But I prefer my women inflatable!
<p>
An inflatable woman is great,<br>
No worry of babies or AIDS,<br>
If you get too elated,<br>
And she gets deflated,<br>
You can patch things up with duct tape!
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I asked this gay fellow, James<br>
If inflatable men was his game.<br>
He said that they'll do<br>
When he just wants to screw,<br>
But fake dicks don't taste the same!

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 03/09/98</h3>
You’ve been bad, old grouch Ebenezer!<br>
Your wife knows how oft you did please ‘er -<br>
That cute little whore<br>
In down town Singapore<br>
You should have used cash, not your VISA!
<p>
Politicians, it seems, always knock...<br>
Like men do when hard as a rock<br>
As Confucius would say<br>
If you pass door side-way<br>
You’re most guaranteed to Bangkok!

I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
Who had one that drooped down to floor<br>
It was the one in the middle<br>
Used to dry up her piddle<br>
And save her on Kleenex galore!
<p>
Disposable condoms? Not me!<br>
I find them restrictive, you see...<br>
When I’ve just had a screw<br>
And then dash for the loo<br>
I’m still hard and they fill up with pee!

A young lass was eagerly steering<br>
Her beau, by the chin, through a clearing.<br>
"Though a beard in the hand<br>
Is a pleasure quite grand,<br>
It's the beard in the bush that's endearing!"

But his balls dragged so he lost'em.

I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
Who constantly ate petit-four<br>
All the while, between bites<br>
Explained seduction rites<br>
Expounding on sexual lore:
<p>
"Disposable condom? Pas me!"<br>
With exquisite accent said she,<br>
"Parce'que condom - it cloak<br>
Votre tool de la poke,<br>
One MUST voyez le pedigree!"

On Saturday night, up on Mars..<br>
All the Martians were hitting the bars<br>
With 30 foot shlongs <br>
Nothing could go wrong<br>
Cause they all like to screw from afar!
<p>
I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
As she watched me from outside the door,<br>
When I asked her why<br>
She said with a cry<br>
I've heard that your balls number four!

<p>Disposable condoms? Not me!<br>
I just plant them beneath an old tree<br>
If you plant them with rocks<br>
Then the tree will grow cocks!<br>
Then just watch them when they all go pee!

<h3>Rhubarb shares classics to answer ALL of Sam Pittman's questions...</h3>
<h4>The Camel</h4>
The sexual live of the camel<br>
Is not quite what everyone thinks.<br>
One night in a moment of passion,<br>
He tried to deflower the Sphinx.
 <p>
Now the Sphinx's posterior regions<br>
Are clogged with the sands of the Nile,<br>
Which accounts for the hump on the camel,<br>
And the Sphinx's inscrutable smile.
<p>
<h4>Lady Lil (Rhubarb tells us he searched for this for over 30 years!)</h4>
Lil was the best our camp produced;<br>
And of all the gents that Lillian goosed,<br>
None had no such goosin', nor never will,<br>
Since the Lord raked in poor Lady Lil. <br>
We had a bet in our town,<br>
Thar warn't no geezer that could brown <br>
Lil to a finish, any style-- <br>
And no bloke ever made the trial.
 <p>
'Cept Short Pete, the halfbreed galoot,<br>
Who wandered in from Scruggins' Chute. <br>
His takin' it surprised us all,<br>
For Pete he warn't so big nor tall,<br>
But when he yanked his tool out thar,<br>
And laid it out across the bar,<br>
We 'lowed our Lil had met her fate,<br>
But thar warn't no backin' out that late.<br>
 <br>
And so we 'ranged to have the mill <br>
Behind the whorehouse on the hill, <br>
Where all the boys could get a seat, <br>
And watch that halfbreed brown his meat. <br>
Lil's start was like the gentle breeze <br>
That swayed the noddin' cypress trees, <br>
But when het up, she screwed for keeps <br>
And laid her victims out in heaps. <br>
 <br>
She tried her twists and double biffs, <br>
And all such m'neuvres known to quiffs.<br>
But Pete war thar with every tack, <br>
And kept a-letting out more jack.<br>
It made us cocksmen fairly sick<br>
To see that half-breed shove his prick.<br>
She gave Short Pete a lively mill, <br>
And wore the grass half off the hill.<br>
 <br>
'Til finally, she missed her shot, <br>
And Short Pete had her on the pot, <br>
But she died game, just let me tell, <br>
And had her boots on when whe fell.<br>
So what the hell! Bill! What the hell!

<i>(Eugene Field)</I>
<h4>Cornholed Dan McGrew</h4>
A bunch of the boys were whooping it up,<br>
In one of the Yukon halls,<br>
And the man who was cranking the music box, <br>
Was warily scratching his balls.<br>
The Faro Kid had his hand on the teats<br>
Of the lady known as Lou, <br>
And there on the floor, on top of a whore,<br>
Lay Dangerous Dan McGrew. <p>

And out of the night that was black as a bitch, <br>
And into the din and the smoke, <br>
Strode a rusty old prick with a crick in his dick,<br>
And a rusty old load in his poke. <br>
His pants were all slit and covered with shit,<br>
That looked like the white of an egg. <br>
His balls hung low and swung to and fro,<br>
Every time he moved his leg.
<p>
His face was as red as a baboon's ass,<br>
And the passioned within it burned. <br>
He pulled out his cock and displayed it about,<br>
And everyone's asshole squirmed.<br>
As he shouldered his way through the fleabitten crowd,<br>
He clutched the crotch of his pants.<br>
He looked like a man with a dose of the clap, <br>
And the last stage of St. Vitus dance.
<p>
The lights went out, I dropped to the floor,<br>
As the stranger sprang in the dark. <br>
With sighs and moans and farts and groans,<br>
His donnicker found its mark. <br>
The wind it blew and the shit it flew,<br>
As I looked 'bout the darkened room,<br>
There on the floor, on top of the whore,<br>
Three forms were stacked in the gloom.
<p>
The lights came on, the stranger rose,<br>
His cock hung limber and blue,<br>
And there on the floor, on top of the whore,<br>
Lay cornholed Dan McGrew.
<p>
(Woodland 1948) <br>
