Unmeaningful bliss<br>
Captured deep within my soul<br>
As the sweet rose dies
<p>
A hidden jungle<br>
So peaceful & beautiful<br>
A monkey swings by

The gentle breezes<br>
Blow through the blue summer sky,<br>
Cooling my hot face

Ecstacy flowing<br>
music sings with my heartbeat<br>
in light like diamonds

<i>The poet comments, "This is what my new year's eve was like until 
it all went horribly wrong..."</i>
<p>Now bad coke morning<br>
sanity is shattering<br>
in light like knife thrusts
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is how i felt after everything went horribly wrong.  Why was I so surprised, that's what concerns me.  Of course everthing was going to go horribly wrong.  i should have expected it. Oh well.  "</i>

While the snow melted away<br>
but you never came

Feet on frozen field,<br>
can you feel seedlings turning<br>
in the womb of earth?
<p>English horn. Few notes.<br>
Fox hunt? A distant thunderstorm...?<br>
Black rider, keep away!

A childs tear's are like<br>
A mothers milk - she feels it <br>
in her chest when they flow

New fallen snow a little<br>
Bird walks onward still

Behold the new year<br>
how many resolutions <br>
still left unbroken?
<p>Shirts, socks, pants,boots, gloves<br>
Christmas gifts which say out loud<br>
"You got the wrong size"!

This season is rough;<br>
Wind, rain, storm, snow, volcanoes--<br>
Look at these tax sheets!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Tax season is the worst season, 
it is a sly dig at the income tax system."</i>

tattered coats of frost
