Precipitously,<br>
fog eclipses clarity:<br>
Whiteness like a sheet.
<p>
Blank orbs in the mist,<br>
black and red at once, it seems.<br>
Alcohol?  Formaldehyde.
<p>
Blank mind, pale visage,<br>
wretched funk of human waste<br>
like orphaned shadows...
<p>
Then, at once, awake!<br>
Zippy, happy Jenks, alive!<br>
Vibrancy and vim!
<p>
Lo, and all around,<br>
white as before yet chang'ed:<br>
Light consumes the fog.
<p>
"How could such a thing<br>
remove me from that cycle?<br>
All at once, and why?"
<p>
"This is not quite right."<br>
Nervous apprehension;<br>
on its heels, terror.
<p>
Pain down below, hot.<br>
White hot pain eclipses light.<br>
"Oh God, end my life!"
<p>
Ever greater grows<br>
Unspeakable agony<br>
Demanding action.
<p>
Crazy shapes abound,<br>
Dance for Mr. Jenkins now.<br>
Jenkins joins the dance.
<p>
Push the shadows, Jenks.<br>
And clutch your white hot belly,<br>
Scream and shake in hell.
<p>
You couldn't escape<br>
the pain of life and of death.<br>
You just put it off.
