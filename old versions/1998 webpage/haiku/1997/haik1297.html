Shi stoops to conquer

Banish'd from heaven.

As the guru sits<br>
Beyond heaven's perfection<br>
She still cries like us.

The sun is shining<br>
Watching you through raindrops light<br>
I keep myself warm

Christmas day at last<br>
Squeaks, screams of delight, laughter<br>
Delirious joy

love reflected by the lights<br>
of Christmas--not gifts

golden sunlight streams through them<br>
treasure to behold

THE FEAR OF DEATH<br>

Survival and gain<br>
It's really taxing my brain<br>
Red, silvers and greens
<p>
<i>Toast Point assumed that "slivers" was really "silvers", but he could be 
wrong.</i>
<p>In silent forests<br>
The sword fern cuts through the night<br>
Black between greyness
<p>
I watched silently<br>
as a deer sat near a brook<br>
stealth not intended
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> How can something so<br>
simple be so hard to write?<br>
Good things take more time!
<p>Snow is worth getting<br>
If all else fails to please us<br>
A most simple thing
<p>Over at the toy store<br>
I saw the fake Santa Claus<br>
With his knowing smile
<p>Separation now<br>
Others cannot play with us<br>
at the holidays
<p>A wellspring of joy<br>
That the holidays appoint<br>
Celebrate all things
