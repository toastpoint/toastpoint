A gem of despair<br>
allowed by autumn breeze to<br>
float to its ground fire

Paper stream city<br>
screaming with the cheer of a<br>
million weightless flames

Trickle of water<br>
Encased in concrete banks flows,<br>

Drinking my milkshake<br>
Its cold hand embraces me.<br>
Why can't this be life?
<p>
Raindrops fall to earth.<br>
Tears from the eyes of autumn.<br>
I have dried my own.
<p>
Saturday mornings -<br>
Padding down the hall in socks.<br>
I sing as you sleep.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Written in honor of all those beautiful Saturday mornings spent with my love."</i>

You'll tell her it's over.<br>

One moment and she knew love.<br>
But moments die young.

Malls and MTV  <br>
Healthy fast food, internet<br>
short attention span

My feet have been scarred<br>
Where they drove those rusty nails<br>
So hard to wear thongs

I will come swimming<br>
But only when I have cleared <br>
Those hagfish away

Lady Cynthia<br>
Art thee but a shadow cold<br>
Dark, without substance?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Longer grow the shadows cold and deeper the night as time is
changed by the imperfect hands of man and his finite concept
of a universe without edge and light full of shadows, cold
and still he doth try to prolong that which is preset.  Oh, vanity!"</i><p>
<h3>Toast Point grins, and responds</h3>
Nay, gentle sirrah<br>
Lady Cynthia, she loves<br>
And loves you truly!</i>

About to fall asleep<br>
The first raindrops pouring down<br>
From the thundershower
<p>
Gay notes from the nest<br>
from hungry little bills<br>
eggs became birds
<p>
A young blue tit<br>
dangling on a little twig<br>
the world reversal
<p>
The sky reflected<br>
in a large waterpool.<br>
That's the Universe
<p>
Little owl in a willow -<br>
along the water dyke<br>
the footprints of mice

Bumblebees moving<br>
On the goldenrod, bodies<br>
Rounded like flowers.
<p>
Morning mist rises<br>
From the pond I pass each day.<br>
Roads go on forever.

The cold sound of rain<br>
In the middle of the night...<br>

Time is a Dragon.<br>
Its claws tearing me apart.<br>
Where is my white knight?

Be with her when day turns night.<br>
For now you are mine.

Glory distracts me!<br>
Small red ball nicks my top edge<br>
Lands in hands in slips

The cicada clacks<br>
In the bright hot summer sun<br>
Birth, mating, then death.

Screeches looking for his mate<br>
Solitary echo.

<i>The poet comments, "An image from a great camping trip I took, with three of my best friends.  I use the image every day, to bring back the memory.  Zen mind. The heat of the fireplace's flames and ambers, the glow on my eyes; hypnotizing.  We camped by a small river.  8000 feet, very cold.  A huge brown bear hit our camp and provided lots of excitement, but I remember the flames of the campfire, the embers. And the brook.  I am sitting."</i>
