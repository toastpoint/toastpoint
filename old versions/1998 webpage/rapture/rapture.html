<b>Warning -  - much work 
remains to be done.  But you're welcome to see what's here so far.</b>

<b>The History</b> - The Savoynet mailing list is an internet-based list for Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados.  Having recently joined the list, I sent out the following plea:<p>
<i>In the heat and boredom of rehearsals, quite often specific lines or
entire songs can be parodied and shared with the cast at cast parties or
tense moments of rehearsal.  Any good ones out there?</I>
<p>
There were so many wonderful responses I decided to sort them all out and give them a web page.  So here 'tis, in show order, with extra goodies thrown in.
<hr>
<h2>Trial by Jury</h2>
FOREMAN OF THE JURY: <BR>We've but one word, m'lord, and that is Rupture.

<hr>
<h2>The Sorcerer</h2>
J.W. WELLS: <BR>My name is John Wellington Wells,
                     I'm a dealer in magic and smells...

<hr>
<h2>HMS Pinafore</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
HEBE: <BR>"And we are the milkmaids and the farmers and the plants!" (which
quickly morphed into the alternate "...farmers in his pants!")
<hr>
<h4>Rica Mendes wrote:</h4>
Well, Eric, I recall a rather funny and sudden one that happened during
the 2nd run of Pinafore during my first year at Oberlin (it was also my
first lead [Hebe] and my first time tech directing). Our Ralph, an
incredibly talented fellow, was graduating that weekend, and came out
with a great improv in the middle of dress rehearsal - he remained in
character the whole time, so none of us dared stop him...<p>
	"My friends, my leave of Oberlin I'm taking...<br>
	For, ah, my (bank account/GPA*) is breaking... "		<p>
*I'm not sure which phrase he used... 
<p>
And I can't remember the rest, but it was brilliant.

<hr>
DICK DEADEYE: <BR>"You are but slaves. A _lady_ she? ...a ho! A ho!"<p>
CHORUS: <BR>"Shall we submit?  Are we butt slaves?"
<p>
DEADEYE: <BR>Forebear, nor carry out the scheme you've planned,<br>
                  She is a lady, you a music stand...
<hr>
<h3>Act II</h3>
From the bells trio: "...and the tar who plows his daughter."
<hr>
<h4>Mary Finn wrote:</h4>
I am prone to this sort of foolish behavior. My favorite is a rewrite of
"He Is an Englishman" that I think I posted to SavoyNet over a year ago. I
originally wrote it when I was costume designer for a production of
PINAFORE at MIT, "a many years ago.<p>
	For he is an English muffin!<br>
	Oh, he might have been a breadstick, <br>
	Or pancakes made from Bisquik, <br>
	Or even Stove Top Stuffin'. <br>
	But in spite of all entreaties<br>
	To become a bowl of Wheaties, <br>
	He remains an English muffin! <br>
	Yes, he is an E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-English muffin!
<p>
As I recall, at the time I wrote this, complex carbohydrates were a hot
topic in health news circles.
<hr>CAPTAIN CORCORAN:<BR>
	In uttering a proposition to any British tar,<br>
	I try to speak with cool persuasion, but you're way over par.<br>
	I'm always happy to examine a sailor in my spa,<br>
	So call the Bosun to my cabin: we'll try menage a trois.

<h2>The Pirates of Penzance</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
FREDERIC (to Ruth):<br>
Oh, falsies!  You have deceived me!<p>
RUTH:<BR>
I have deceived you?
<p>
FREDERIC:<BR>
Yes, deceived me!<br>
You told me you were 36D...
<p>
RUTH:<BR>
And master, am I not so?
<p>
FREDERIC<BR>
And now I see you're flat as a tree!<br>
(etc.)
<p>
FREDERIC<BR>
Faceless woman!
<p>
RUTH (who has no face, and therefore no mouth)<br>
Mmmmmmm, mmmmmm!
<P>
PIRATES:<BR>
"Yes, yes, he is a Major Genital!" and "Yes, yes, the Major
Genital comes." 

<h3>Act II</h3>
MAJOR-GENERAL STANLEY:<BR>
Resume your ranks and legislative duties,<br>
And take my daughters, all of whom have cooties!
<p>
(Herpes instead of cooties was suggested as well)

<hr>
<h2>Patience</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
CHORUS OF RAPTUROUS MAIDENS (at an ill-attended rehearsal): <br>"Twenty
lovesick maidens we; each of us is two or three..." <br>

or "Twenty brain-dead maidens we..."
<p>
SAPHIR: <br>Tis Patience!  Sappy girl!
<p>
DRAGOONS: <br>We soldiers all are queens, we dress in kinky leather,<br>
                     Upon the battle scene, we run away together...<br>
<hr>
When the Duke asks Major Murgatroyd if he's fond of
toffee in act one, the director of the particular production being
discussed rewrote it to "Are you fond of brownies?"  (Boy, *that* one
could have been milked if we wanted to...) Anyway, one night, the
sequence went this way:<p>
	"Tell me, Major, are you fond of large-breasted Swedes?"<br>
	"Uhhhhhhh.....very."<br>
	"We....are all fond of large-breasted Swedes."<br>
	"WE ARE!!!!!!!"<br>
	"Yes, and large-breasted Swedes in moderation are a capital thing.  But
to live on large-breasted Swedes?  Brigid for breakfast, Ingrid for
dinner..."
<hr>
BUNTHORNE: <br>It is a wild...weird...FLESHLY thing!  I call it "Bruno"...
<p>
DRAGOONS: <br>We've been thrown over, we're aware,<br>
                     But we don't care, but we don't care,<br>
                     There's fish in the sea, no doubt of it,<br>
                     And frankly we don't give a ....<br>
<p>
DRAGOONS: <br>Oh, horror! Urged by his solicitor,<br>
                     He's actually got the part he auditioned for!<p>

BUNTHORNE: <br>Oh Fortune, I am hard...
<p>
CHORUS: <br>But who is this, whose god-like grace<br>
                Proclaims he comes from outer space?<br>
<p>
ONE MEMBER OF AFOREMENTIONED CHORUS (OH ALL RIGHT, ME):<br>
                But who is this, with god-like grace<br>
                Playing Pink Floyd tunes on a five-string bass?<br>
<hr>
<h2>Iolanthe</h2>
<h3>Act II</h3>
LORD CH.: <br>For you dream you are crossing the Channel and tossing about in a
steamer from Dover,<br>
Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very small
second-hand Skoda.
<p>
LORD CH.: <br>In your shirt and your socks, the black silk with gold cocks...

<hr>
QUEEN:<br>"How would you like to be a fairy guardsman?"<P>
WILLIS:<br>"Actually, ducky..."<P>
(That was done during a rehearsal, but believe me, during performances,
some of Strephon's lines got laughs that I'm sure Gilbert never
intended.)
<p>
WILLIS: <br>Well ma'am, I don't think much of the British soldier who wouldn't
inconvenience himself to save a lady in dis dress. (indicating Fairy
Queen's dress)

<hr>
<h2>Princess Ida</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
FLORIAN:<br>Will Prince Hilarion's hopes be badly sighted?

<h3>Act II</h3>
CHORUS (replying to Katisha): <br>"Bow-wow to his daughter-in-law elect!"

<hr>
<h2>Ruddigore</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
DICK DAUNTLESS: <br>"My heart, it up and says... 'Dick,' it says! -- It calls
me 'Dick' because I am one --" 
<p>
DESPARD: <br>"I claim young Robin as my former lover!"
<hr>
<h3>Act II</h3>
ROSE MAYBUD: <br>"And I'll be asserting my freedom by flirting with ev'ry cute
fellow I meet: I'll cheat!"

<hr>
<h2>The Yeomen of the Guard</h2>
"Hark! What was that sir?"<br>

"Why an octopus, fired by a dwarf, unless I'm much mistaken."<br>

"Strange and at such an hour. What can it mean?"

<p>
This is our joy-day, Uncle Floyd!
<hr>
<h4> Steve Lichtenstein wrote:</h4>
Last night I played piano for a brushup rehearsal of the Lamplighters' Yeomen
of the Guard, which is being given two extra performances in Walnut Creek, CA
next weekend, following the recent successful run in San Francisco.
<p>
We were all fairly tired by the end of the evening, and as the rehearsal was
being run somewhat informally, I decided to liven things up a bit.  As Meryll
approached Carruthers in preparation for wooing her (just before "Rapture,
Rapture"), I struck up the opening chords to "Willow Titwillow."
<p>
After the laugh, somebody remarked:  "It's the same scene."  To which someone
else replied:  "IS it?"
<hr>
<h2>The Gondoliers</h2>
<h3>Act I</h3>
DUKE OF P.T.(to Casilda): It's extraordinary what unprepossessing people
one can love, if one gives one's mind to it.<br>
DUCHESS OF P.T.(to Casilda): I loved your husband.
<p>
As they know we object to pavilions and palaces,<br>
 How can they respect our republican phalluses?
<p>
Hey, it rhymes better than "fallacies"...

<h3>Act II</h3>
DON ALHAMBRA:<br>Now let the loyal leeches gather round...
<p>
INEZ: <br>"His name: Luiz! Behold his royal heinie!" 

<hr>
<h2>Utopia, Ltd.</h2>
ZARA: Tan-tan-ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra!<p>
FITZBATTLEAXE: Trumpet call of the Christmas fairy!

<hr>
<h2>Extra Goodies</h2>
<h3>The Patter Man Blues</h3>
<h4>Written by Mike Nash, 8th February 1997</h4>
Oh, a patter-man's lot is a happy one, NOT!<br>
If you'll listen to this brief oration;<br>
From "Trial" to "Grand Duke" he must ride each rebuke<br>
And regale 'em with rapid narration.<br>
He will hone and refine every word, every line<br>
And enunciate all with perfection;<br>
But when he tries to sing, well it don't mean a thing;<br>
All he gets is abuse and rejection.<br>
Though you polish your breathing, projection and tone,<br>
Still you finish up seething, when all's said and done;<br>
All you get is abuse and rejection!<br>
<br>
If you wish to succeed singing patter, you'll need<br>
To obey every rule to the letter;<br>
You must practise the art of the old D'Oyly Carte<br>
Till you're Lytton, Green, Pratt, Reed or better.<br>
You must copy the pros from your top to your toes<br>
Every line, every move, every gesture;<br>
For if you should say e'en a word your own way<br>
You'll incur the wrath of your director!<br>
It's a general law, though your zeal it may kill:<br>
If the pros you ignore and you do what you will,<br>
You'll be sure to upset your director!<br>
<br>
Comes Sir Ruthven maybe, or the Duke of P.T.,<br>
Oh, there's lots of traditional clowning:<br>
You must run here and there with your arms in the air<br>
Till you're gasping for breath like you're drowning.<br>
Then there's always a dance in a tight pair of pants<br>
As you belt out the bass of a trio;<br>
But to further the pain, you must sing it again,<br>
Only this time, allegro con brio!<br>
Oh, it adds to the chore of a patter-man's day<br>
When you have to encore the worst song in the play<br>
Once again, but allegro con brio!<br>
<br>
Though your brain it may teem with a marvellous scheme<br>
To be true to the script, yet original,<br>
There's so much of tradition debarred of omission<br>
Your thoughts become merely vestigial.<br>
Though you feel such a twit, 'cause your costume don't fit<br>
And it grips you too tight round the willy;<br>
Bless your heart, they don't care, it's the cross you must bear:<br>
You're the comic, you've got to look silly!<br>
You've a loftier goal; each audition you go<br>
For a serious role, but do you get it? NO!<br>
You're the comic, you've got to be silly!
