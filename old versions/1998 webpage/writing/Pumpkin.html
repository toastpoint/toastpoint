<h1>Autumn Comfort with Whipped Cream</h1>
After the first breath of frost, and the unsettling appearance of
Indian Summer ("Ha ha, you schmuck - you thought you were going to
wear all those sweaters you just took out of storage!  Guess
again!"), we were finally getting honest-to-god fall weather with
all the trimmings - the leafless trees, the chill in the air, and
the appearance of pumpkin desserts in restaurants.  I mention this
because I've always been a pumpkin pie fanatic, and have dabbled in
less common uses for the flavor (ice cream, mmmm!) and I've always
found the appearance of hot spiced cider and other fall cuisine to
be rather comforting, considering what's ahead - a mad rush of
holidays and then three months of cold and pointless weather.
<p>
I had moved to Philadelphia in August, basically on a whim - having
just finished graduate school, I thought it was probably a good
idea to start "real life" in a new city.  The first month or so was
tough - no one told me that I'd be paying more per annum for car
insurance than I paid for the car - but eventually, life got
settled.  The apartment was livable, I was working steadily, I had
met someone nice to spend weekends with, and I had been cast in a
play!
<p>
The play was <i>No Sex Please, We're British</i>, an inane farce
(but a lot of fun to be <b>in</b>), and the theater was Plays and
Players, at 17th and Delancey.  I could walk there from my
Fairmount apartment, and this particular Monday night, I had. 
Rehearsal was over, it was about nine o'clock, and I didn't feel
like walking home in the cold without an added incentive.  Coffee
and dessert seemed like relevant concepts, considering the time of
night and the weather, and I headed over to Uncle's, a restaurant
and bar on Camac Street.
<p>
It being a cold Monday night, the bar was pretty empty, so rather
than taking a table for my late-night indulgence, I took a bar
stool, asked the bartender for a cup of coffee and asked about the
dessert menu.  A waiter from the restaurant recited it for me, and
as I was thinking "Wouldn't it be nice if they had pumpkin pie, or
maybe cheesecake?", he said the magic words "Pumpkin cheesecake". 
The flood from my salivary glands that this caused made it
difficult to say "That will do nicely", but the waiter understood
and within minutes brought me some coffee and a scrumptious slice
of dessert.
<p>
No, usually people don't walk into a bar and get coffee and cake,
and I knew that, and it didn't surprise me at all to see the other
patrons casting a quizzical eye in my direction.  However, I wasn't
prepared for the "Aha!" looks on their faces.  Maybe it was the
whipped cream that got to them - anyway, there were hurried
consultations with the bartender and soon three other bar patrons
had cups of coffee and slices of pumpkin cheesecake in front of
them.
<p>
I rarely think of myself as a trend-setter, but on that particular
night, I set a (highly caloric) example for a bunch of guys
escaping from the cold on a bar on a Monday, and by example, gave
them the comfort of a seasonal dessert.  It was then I knew that
not only could I make this move to Philadelphia a success, but
maybe my presence would even have a positive effect!  With those
cheery thoughts, and the sugar rushing through my bloodstream, I
put on my coat, wrapped my scarf around my neck and set out.
