<b>December</b> -<br>
Wumpus and Toast Point are frantically preparing for the 
holidays, as they are hosting multitudinous dinner parties.  Toast 
Point had two business trips in two weeks (Philadelphia, where he 
visited old haunts and old friends, and Chicago, which was fun) and is now 
preparing to play Pish-Tush in a concert Mikado at CAMI Hall, 57th St., across 
from Carnegie Hall on Dec. 17th, 8:00 p.m. (it's free! Come see him!),
<p>
<h4>Within the last months...</h4>
Toast Point has
delightedly discovered <a

play original arcade games and is reliving his college days by incessantly playing Crystal
Castles.<p>
