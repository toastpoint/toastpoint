<h3><a href=mailto:danieloconnaughton@yahoo.com>TS O'Rama</a> begins a Science Fiction novel 01/16/98</h3>

  Recently I visited the famous Steinbergs Memorial in Lebanon,
 Pennsylvania. It was partly out of curiosity and partly out of fear. You
 see, the monument was modelled after some long lost sketches by the
 great Leonardo Da Vinci (a great Steinberg himself) who claimed that if
 his drawings were constructed in exact detail, anyone who approached the
 monument could discover for him/herself if they were indeed worthy of
 the name "Steinbergs".
<p>
   Desirous of knowing whether I could rightfully be called a "steinberg"
 by my friends, I paid the $38 round trip bus fare from columbus and
 headed out on an overcast and foggy morning. I did not know what to
 expect - I didn't even know what the monument looked like! - but I felt
 like somehow this trip would change my life forever. With such thoughts
 going madly through my head, I looked down at the crossword puzzle that
 I had clipped out of the Saturday morning Columbus Dogpatch. It was a
 daily ritual of mine to slaughter the various mind games that were
 printed out on the thin rag paper. Having long since tired of solving
 the CW puzzle the regular way, I now forced myself to fill in the
 squares with synonyms of antonyms depending on my mood. But no mixing
 was allowed. It made things difficult if, halfway through the puzzle my
 mood changed, because I really was more adept at figuring out antonyms
 to words when I was content and relatively happy and synonyms when I
 felt ornery and generally ant-social. (A shrink once told me that I had
 a displaced personality which explained my objective look at how I was
 NOT feeling at any particular time.)
<p>
   Anyway, I had been relatively content until I noticed that my former
 choice of entries to the puzzle had forced me to come up with an antonym
 for the clue "split ends" that was 5 letters long and had a "c", "z", and
 "k" in it. This was mildly distressing, but it was all that was needed to
 put me over the edge and into a gloomy frame of mind. I resolved to look
 through my foreign language dictionary collection to come up with an
 answer later, and then folded that paper up and put it in my jacket
 pocket. Luckily, we were almost there so I woke up the pretty young woman
 who had asked to use my shoulder as a head rest during the trip (she
 ended up slumped over asleep in my lap), and brushed a small pool of
 saliva off of my pants. She thought it was funny and said, "Your cotton
 pants and leg remind me of my pillow so I must've really dropped off!"
<p>
   I ignored the oddity of her remark and got off the bus feeling a little
 stiff from the 3 hour ride. The monument was in the center of town. I
 could see a crowd of people around it about 100 yards from where I stood.
 As I approached, I was amazed at the quietness of the large group of
 people gathered there, and let out an almost involuntary "Steinbergs!" to
 liven the people up. Immediately, I heard a few people to begin crying,
 and an elderly man turned to me and said, "Don't you have any sympathy? I
 can see you are not a true "steinberg" either so you of all people should
 understand their pain!"
<p>
   Only then did I notice the memorial. Only then ded I understand. And
 only then did I not understand. I realized that I was not yet one of that
 hallowed band of scholars, musicians, and free thinkers. I was confused.
 How could this be? I mean, I can do English crossword puzzles in 4
 languages; I'm a successful computer programmer who truly understands the
 difference between comp-3 and comp-5 data representation; I read
 vociferously on current topics and classical themes. I looked at my
 unenlightened reflection in the memorial and cried.
<p>
   To understand my dismay, let me briefly describe the Steinberg
 Memorial. It appeared, at first glance, to be a large slab of polished
 granite. The granite was very dark and of exquisite grain and quality.
 (I learned later that it was discovered about 100 feet below the rock
 strewn surface of Toucanman Ravine in the White Mountains of New
 Hampshire. Geology students analyzing core samples found the matchless
 underground rock formation.) As one got closer, it became a mirror that
 seemed to engulf you. The angles and dimensions had been precisely laid
 out, and their intricacy became very apparent upon micro inspection. The
 monument was designed so that the reflection was an all-encompassing
 three dimensioal view of the area in front. I said that I could see
 myself but that is only half true - my reflection was a hideous
 representation of what I really looked like. True "steinbergs" looked
 normal, but most of us non-steinbergs looked just plain hideous. There
 was one guy reflected there who had huge locks of nosehair billowing out
 and blowing in the breeze that reached down to his ankles. One female
 non-steinie looked like a simple stick figure that you would draw on
 paper except tht she had feet for hands - they looked to be size 18! My
 reflection was twisted so that I looked like I was made of a couple of
 large elastic bands that had been twisted into a quasi-human form. It was
 disarming, and I stood frozen in shock for a moment. The true steinbergs
 reflections ded not seem to be any different than a normal reflection,
 but they stood there for a long while contemplating themselves and I
 wondered what THEY saw.
<p>
   I walked away. I needed time to think. Would I ever enjoy a good
 steinbergs joke again? Could I possibly change the current course of events
 and by so doing become a respected member of that elite group? But it was
 time to get something to eat.
<p>
   I took a circuitous route back to the eatery "Guerny's Time-Killer Cafe".
 I wanted to avoid the image that resonated in my head - the image of myself
 represented in the Steinberg mirror of shame. The mirror made me look like
 I'd been shoveled between two pile irons; like a human representation of
 the Flatironz building in New York. I arrived at the Cafe and was relieved
 to see no mirrors - nothing that could possibly again bring back the
 Steinbergian horror. Still, with subtle glances I perused the faces of
 those at the Cafe...wondering who were steinbergs and who weren't. My
 curiosity led me to ask the waitress, a comely girl who wore a simple denim
 dress and smelled of Avon's Irish Creme ala Hand Cream. She looked faintly
 French, her lips small and head oval, and she warmed to my glance by
 lightly placing her right breast on my left shoulder.
<p>   "Whadd ya want?", she said in a heavy Brooklyn accent. My illusions were
 squashed, but I recovered quickly.
   <p>"I'll take the Chino stew and pale blue egg soup. Also, can you tell me
 the significance of the Steinberg monument and why some people's visages
 look horrible, and other's normal?"
<p>   "Honey, I ain't here on business babe, i'm only here for fun. Or
 vice-versa, you get my drift. I don't ask questions, and I don't answer
 them. Ask that man over there - the Al Ginsberg look-alike with the pipe
 in his mouth."
   <p>I thanked her and screwed my courage to approach the scraggly-bearded
 man.
<p>   "Sir, my name is Moon River, and I was wondering what the deal about the
 steinberg mirror is."  I had made up the name Moon River after havingread
 how these 60's survivors love strange & wacky drug-induced naming
 conventions.
<p>   "Well Moon, if I may call you that," he said.
   <p>"Call me Moon, or even Ol' man River - doesn't matter to me!" I said.
<p>   He ignored the joke.
   <p>"Steinbergs...ahh...son you got a lot to learn. You know you're a
 steinberg if-" AND THAT'S WHEN WE LOST TRANSMISSION!!
<hr>
   I came to my senses about 15 seconds later. I was dazed. Caught up in a
 vortex of confusion. Never before had I blacked out so completely - not
 even that time with Clarissa on my Uncle Jim's farm in Piddle, OH.
 Something was happening to me, and I was convinced that it had to do with
 this Steinbergian quest of mine. I mean, what else could it be - surely
 not the stew or blue egg soup that I had just forced down the hatch. The
 Al Ginsber look-alike was still talking, "...and the talk just won't die
 down. I reckon if someone was to get an itch in their heel they could get
 to the bottom of this Steinberg business. Like I was just saying...a
 steinberg is known by his sense of mystery, and you got more mystery
 around you than a dog has fleas. Why just a minute ago, your eyes glazed
 over and I wasn't sure if any of this was getting thru to you or not."
<p>   He leaned in my direction. I detected the scent of his Old Spice as he
 whispered, "Seriously, son, you'd be best to be careful. I seen alot a
 fellas like yourself come through this town, and I wonder what happens to
 them all.  They either go back to where they came from or, as some like to
 think, maybe they really do get swallowed up in their dream. I, for one,
 wish that confounded monument wasn't here at all. It may be  bringin' in
 some business, but it's bringin' in more bad than good - and that's for
 damn sure! They ain't been able to explain the recent disappearances in
 these parts, and I think it's due to the mirror rock out there."
<p>   "What do you mean by 'disappearances'?, I asked, "I haven't heard
 anything about stuff like that."
<p>   "And your probably the only one within a cow fart that hasn't...over the
 past 6 months there hve been nearly 50 missing persons reported in a 100
 mole radius around Leb'nun (that's how natives say it), and none of 'em
 has as much as showed a tooth around here. I think it's because of the
 monument 'cause it's only been here for a couple of years, and I think
 that there is something really strange about that rock. One feller told me
 he saw a steinbergian woman slowly fade away behind or into the monument -
 he couldn't tell me which it was. Now that's wierd sh-t! If you'll pardon
 me saying so...you ain't religious are ya'?" I lied and nodded the
 negative sign. "Sev'ral of your type that I met seem to be 'specially
 pious, and I got no cause to offend."
 <p>  I wasn't really listening to him. I was looking outside the diner. There
 on the sidewalk was the curious young woman that had travelled next to me
 on the bus. She was looking down at a map and then up at the sky toward
 where hte son was setting. Then she reached into her jeans and pulled out
 a piece of Bazooka bubble gum. She held the map under her arm while she
 separated the gum from the wrapper and I found myself admiring her
 suddenly. I hadn't really noticed her before on the bus, the crossword
 puzzle and my own thoughts preoccupied me on the way over here. But I do
 remember glancing once at her sleeping form, and realizing in a distant
 sense that she was an attractive woman. I remembered how soft her brown
 hair looked as it fell across her face and the one lock of hair that was
 strewn through the growing pool of drool on my leg.
 <p>  "Thanks, Al, for the advice." I interrupted. I threw a five and a one on
 the table and went outside. "You watch yourself!" he yelled behind me.
 <p>  Once outside, I quickly noticed the quaintness and charm surrounding
 this part of Lebanon. The rainy overcast look had abated to the east, and
 there was the quiet sun setting, on its way to the other side of the
 planet. I walked around the corner of the cafe, and went over to where the
 brown-haired slobber-sleeper was standing a few seconds earlier. She had
 started on down the street so I observed her as I followed. As I got
 closer, I settled it in my mind that she was one fine specimen of a woman.
 She was wearing an old pair of jeans that weren't too tight or too loose -
 the kind that take a year or two to break in that well. She was obviously
 looking for something from her map so she was completely unconscious of
 me. Not that she was ever that self-conscious probably. Anyone that can
 fall asleep on a strangers lap, and THEN drool all over them can't be
 self-conscious. The more I thought about it the more I liked that thought.
 <p>  There is nothing that I enjoy more than watching an attractive lady when
 she doesn't think she is being observed. She sauntered along, and I
 noticed that she had a natural grace to her movements that added to the
 well-formed shape that God had bequeathed upon her. As I caught up to her,
 I breathed a quick "excuse me" and watched her turned around to face me. I
 will not forget the look that I saw in her eyes!
 <hr>  The look was a look of desire of course, for any other look would've
 receded into my memory like sediment beneath a river. It was a look of
 familiarity too, for no woman falls in love at first sight, at least not
 with the kind of fervor this chestnut-haired woman did.
<p>   "Do I know you? I mean, I know I sat next to you on the bus, but I did
 not wake you because you looked so peaceful," I said.
 <p>  "Yes, I do know you. Or at least I know what type of person you are.
 I've lived in Leb'n for some time now, and good people glow on the
 outskirts of town, only to become monster-like as they near the Monument."
 <p>  "OH! I was wondering why reflections in the mirror near the Monument
 were sometimes terrifying."
 <p>  "You best not go near the monument again," she said, "because people
 seem to be disappearing. Come with me to my apartment and I'll show you
 the research I've been doing on it."
 <p>  I followed her like a dog follows its master - adoringly, obediently and
 with tongue residing outside of mouth. Her beauty had grown on me from the
 time her saliva graced my trousers. Her mouth had lain so engagingly on my
 thigh, and I had to suppress thoughts of adjusting its position higher.
 <p>  Her apartment, like her clothing, had a homey,lived-in look and I could
 appreciate the horse theme. There was a horse quilt, a photo of herself at
 the QuarterHorse Congress, a picture of her in chaps at a rodeo and a
 mural of a Kentucky horse farm.
  <p> "Nice horse stuff. I like 'em but I don't ride unfortunately" I said.
 <p>  She merely nuzzled against me. It felt easy and right, like a horse and
 a rider in rhythm.
 <p>  "Well, so, where's that research!?" I asked, a bit nervous.
 <p>  She brought over a Nike Shoe box and showed me faded newspaper
 clippings, photos and a few religious icons.
 <p>  "We've had twenty documented disappearances. They disappear within a
 radius of 20 yards of the monument and the only things that don't
 disappear with the person is any religious artifact that he or she may
 have on them. That's why I have the St. Christopher medal, rosaries and
 pocket bibles here. It seems the thing they have in common is a religious
 faith, notably Catholic. Also the women tend to outnumber the men by 5 to
 1. Looks like women are better people after all!"
 <p>  "Ha, must be a fluke. Not a large enough sample" I said.
 <p>  She was so beautiful now, being in town but not near the monument, that
 it was as if she had a halo. Her face was just inches from my own, and it
 was the most natural event in the world for our lips to touch - barely
 touch. We moved them slightly against the others' cushiony softness. Her
 lips were expert at pleasing mine, and soon my mouth fell to her spring
 buds that seemed to watch me like sentries perched over the valley created
 by her breasts. Her soft breath came into my ear while my lips roamed the
 crests of her chest, and she uttered faint whisperings as I fell into a
 milky reverie brought upon by her opulent skin.
 <p>  I unknowingly mouthed the word 'steinbergs' and then I came back to my
 senses. Well, sort of. The beautiful mysterious stranger was still
 whispering softly and it did not take me long to figure out that it was
 not entirely (if at all) due to my kisses. I held still for a moment and
 listened to see if I could make out any words. She said what sounded like:
 "...in time the human race...beyond mere matter...Cheerios and apple
 pie...wither and fall...I like the...wither and fall...sprite in you...
 fall...". Gently, I laid her down on an old couch and touched her lightly
 on the cheek to bring her back from wherever it was she had gone. She
 looked quite exquisite there in the semi-dark, and I could not keep myself
 from briefly noticing the obvious effects of my former caresses. For she
 was bra-less under her V-neck shirt. I was going to call to her, but I
 realized then that I still did not know her name. So I bent over her and
 nudged her a little more forcefully. All of a sudden, the glazed look left
 her eyes and she smiled at the unabashed concern on my face.
  <p>  "Sir, you ought to patent that kiss of yours. I feel more relaxed than
 I have in several days," she explained quietly.
  <p>  "Are you alright? I mean, what happened to you. I was worried. And, by
 the way, what is your name?" I asked.
<p>    "Oh Johnny," she exclaimed, "you saved me from flying couch stuffings!
 How brave of you to put yourself in the line of fire and take all those
 feathers in the gut!"
   <p>  "Ha ha.  How can you joke about something like this?  What the
 heckledeesyburgerillaters exploded?"
<p>     "heckle what?"
   <p>  "oh, heckledeesyburgerillaters - it was a saying we had as a kid.  In-
 stead of just saying heck.  Guess you had to be there!  I must've flashed
 back to my childhood while watching my life flash before my eyes.  We were
 silly kids; we used to chant the name of a local car dealer, 'Woody Sander
 Ford!' for no good reason at all.  We'd chant the name of any place of
 business along our bus route, and 'Woody Sander Ford' was the one that
 stuck.  To this day I still smile when i hear the word 'woody'.
<p>     She looked at me with her voluminous eyes and said seductively, "i
 smile when i hear the word 'woody' too, big boy."  I gently lifted her
 up from a spent pile of couch stuffings, and we examined the bullet holes
 near the window.
   <p>  "Who wants us dead?" I asked 'Gina.
<p>     "Well I'd say somebody knows that we know something.  Or maybe they just
 don't like the cut of our gib!"
 <p>    "You make me laugh Gina, and that's rare for a woman.  Your sense of
 humor is really wonderful."
   <p>  "Well Tom, er, I mean Johnny, the way you say 'woody' turns me on."
 <p>     We talked to our apartment neighbors to see if they'd seen anything.
 They all seemed strange, as if in a trance.  One neighbor, Hank Ketchup
 said he "ain't seen a thing" but did offer a bottle of Heines' finest.
 I said I never do the stuff before noon.
 <p>     We called the police, although Gina seemed reluctant at first.
 The police sent out a man who really didn't look like an officer - the uniform
 was right, but the way his eyes blinked it looked eerie - like a robot or
 something.

<hr>
<h3>11/17/93</h3>
      He surveyed the damage, the glass of the doomed chandelier crink-
 ling under his foot, and pulled out a notepad and began to write some-
 thing down. Regina walked over to the window on the front wall which had
 borne the brunt of the bullets onslaught, and looked out into the night.
 The air was clear and cool now. The escaping warm air of the house and
 the incoming cooler air stirred up a little breeze that was softly blow-
 ing the hair from her face. I was impressed by her calm and collected
 manner - she was definitely a low maintenance woman.
 <p>     The officer said, "You two are very lucky," he said while squatting
 down to look at something embedded in the far wall of the room, "...to
 still be alive." I felt like I was listening to cassette recording of a
 Matlock show. The officer spoke as if he were reciting a script.
  <p>    He picked up something that looked like a small electronic beeper
 device and lazily slipped it in his pocket.
   <p>   "What is THAT? - that thing you just put in your pocket?," I asked.
 Regina whirled around and the cop just looked at me dumbly.
  <p>    "Uh...I don't know, but we'll check it out downtown and let you
 know what we find out," he returned.
   <p>   "Can I see it please?" I put my hand out. Regina came over quickly
 and grabbed my arm with one hand and put the other on my face, "Johnny,
 let's just leave and let this man do his job. I'm sure he'll check into
 everything that needs checking into..."
  <p>   The man had backed away from me when I held out my hand, and now he
 just stood there watching Regina and me. I was beginning to get an ugly
 feeling in the pit of my stomach - I always felt this way after eating a
 Big Mac. I began to think that this man was an imposter, but I needed to
 find out for sure. I most certainly did not want to leave there without
 getting some questions answered.
 <p>   I thought of offering him a donut. No policeman ever turns down a
 free donut - especially ones that are creme-filled. The absurdity of
 that passing thought brought me back to the present.
  <p>  "Officer, either let me see what you put in your pocket," so much for
 subtlety, "or I'm gonna report your badge number..."
  <p>  "Johnny, let's get out of here!" It was Regina trying to pull me to-
 wards the door.
  <p>  I looked at her, "Are you crazy! Doesn't this whole thing seem a
 little bizarre to you?" I wasn't even bothering to be subtle anymore.
 She just looked at me with that pretty I-don't-get-it face.
 <p>  She pulled me close and whispered, "Come on, I need to talk with you.
 I'm gonna tell you something that will be difficult for both of us to
 take...Outside, not here."
<hr>
<h3>11/23/93</h3>
     Gina took my hand and caressed it as if she were trying to calm
 an unruly pet.  She led me outside and held her hand over my mouth.
 It smelled of Herbal Essence of Ching-A-Ling Dong, a moisturizer I
 remember from my days with Sang Yon Lee when I was in 'Nam slinging
 hash.  She then removed her hand and quickly replaced it with her
 lips - they were warm and wet and animated.  In the background the
 doors of Gina's apartment closed and unclosed noisily.
  <p>  "Don't speak unless it's a whisper. okay?"
<p>    "Okay," i whispered.
   <p> "Johnny I don't know how to say this but...but I will anyway.  Look,
 I'm in on it.  I'm supposed to get you to the Monument but because
 I'm falling for you I'm now targeted along with you by them-"
<p>    "Who is 'them'?" i said.
   <p> "They are militia from the Republic of Sudan.  They are
 working covertly for the Chinese government, but it's not what you
 think.  The purposes are noble believe it or not.  We are trying
 to free the Steinberg's from-".  Just then a flash came from nowhere
 and the heat from a huge blast fell upon us.  I grabbed Gina and
 we ran - ran like the wind until we were very far away and the cinders
 of what was left of her apartment began to cool.
<hr>
<h3> 11/24/93</h3>
    "Do you think he's o.k.?" I gasped for air while asking that quest-
 ion even though I really didn't care about the fate of the unfortunate
 officer at all.
 <p>   We were on the edge of a ridge with sparse trees here and there.
 There was some bedrock breaking out of the rough grass, and Gina was
 half-reclining on the grass with her back leaning back against a small
 rock formation. Looking back from where we had run, I realized that we
 were about a 1/4 mile from her apartment. The rising smoke was making
 the midnight sky even darker in that direction. From our slightly higher
 vantage point, I could see clearly the lights from the fire engine and
 the rescue squad that had been called there by somebody. The revolving
 lights from the vehicles cast a eerie glow into the smoky sky and I was
 a kid just for a moment taking it all in.
 <p>   In my best John Wayne voice I said, "Well, little lady, we'd best be
 gettin' on before they pick up our trail. Do you think we should go to
 the monument or just get outta Leb'nun?"
  <p>  "That's not a good idea - the monument, I mean. We are obviously in
 danger..."
  <p>  "But you said that you were part of a noble cause or something like
 that - why would they want to hurt us?"
 <p>  She looked up at me while I watched her delicate hand pull a clump of
 grass out of the ground, "I don't know what to think right now - I'm
 beginning to think that I've been misled for evil purposes." She dropped
 the clump of grass on my shoe, and then unconsciously pulled up more un-
 witting blades by the roots.
  <p>  "You said something about freeing the Steinbergs...what was the pur-
 pose that they presented to you to convince you to help them?"
 <p>  She was now on her tenth clump of grass and I couldn't see my shoes
 anymore as she brushed her hair out of her face and put it behind her
 ear.
  <p>  "Basically, they told me that these steinbergian people had a chem-
 ical imbalance that prohibited them from enjoying life properly. There
 was a sense of angst, in almost every case that they had researched,
 that kept steinbergs from just accepting life as it was. This angst or
 sense of the tragic was preventing them from being efficient, happy,
 and shiny people. You know, the type of people who go to malls and spend
 ungodly amounts of money on frivolous things - people who make them-
 selves busy, who crank their music loud, who believe in the axiom
 'discuss everything but religion and politics', who sit on their couches
 and let Matlock influence their lifes decisions, and...
  <p>  "Gina, I get the idea..."
  <p>  "The steinberg types question things; they question authority. They
 are the ones that do not blindly accept the so-called axioms of life.
 Some have weird haircuts, they read and comprehend cummings and poe,
 they buy a house and look forward to making it a home complete with a
 library, they tend to enjoy nature and doing belly-flops down wet,grassy
 hillsides, they..."
  <p>   I had leaned over and kissed her to get her to stop talking, not
 because I wasn't interested in what she had to say, but because she was
 suddenly irresistible to me in the soft light of night.
  <p>   Then I grabbed a handful of grass and stuffed it down the front of
 her shirt while dropping another handful on her head. She laughed and
 said I was "in trouble, buster" while putting her hand around my neck
 trying to get me in a headlock. She had a serious grip and she was pull-
 ing me on top of her, but I couldn't turn around and face her such was
 her grip on my neck. We were both laughing totally unaware of our sur-
 roundings caught up in the pleasure of each others company. I leaned
 forward onto my knees as she still clung to my neck from behind. She was
 on top of me, gleefully grunting in my ear, "I got ya now. Whaddaya
 gonna do about that?"
  <p>   I got one hand free, and reached down and squeezed her thigh just
 below her perfect behind, and just as I thought she was ticklish there.
 She loosened her grip a little so I quickly flung her underneath me and
 quickly she was pinned. I grinned at her and asked, "What are you gonna
 do now, my little gladiator?" I kissed her softly for a few moments, and
 neither one of us noticed the shadows that gathered all around us.<hr>
<h3>11/29/93</h3>
      It was the Raisinettes that fell from one of the shadows' pockets
 that alerted me to their presence.  Gina's eyes were half-closed in
 feigned orgasmic pleasure, but I noticed the burly guy with the belly
 the size of Manhattan because I'd been to the movies recently and
 recognized the sound of falling Raisinettes.
<p>     "Quick get them!" he yelled, while picking up loose
 Raisinettes off the ground and putting them into his enormous mouth.
   <p>  I had unpinned Gina and helped her to her feet but they trapped us;
 we were surrounded us on all sides.
<p>     "What do you want?" Gina asked plaintively.
   <p>  "Ahh my little chickadee," said the fat one, "i'd like merely to
 have the pleasure of your company."
<p>     "Calgon take me away," Gina whispered in my ear.
   <p>  "What'd you say??" the big guy said.
<p>     "I said, 'salmon let's go play!'."
   <p>  "oh," he said dumbly.
<p>     He stuffed a big ugly cigar in his mouth and then took it out and
 swirled it in Gina's face.  He made her take a puff before I took
 action.
   <p>  "Stop it right now!  Gina don't smoke!" I said.
<p>     "whatz dis look like? damn non-smoking section of a restaurant?
 Fella's - tie him up."
   <p>  At once the other three silent partners pushed me down and roped
 my wrists.  I felt like cattle at a Fort Worth ropin' contest.  But
 Gina had something besides handlebar-smooth wrists up her sleeve -
 she had a trick.  She'd hit a homing device that was taped delicately
 to her upper thigh.  Soon the Sudanese would come to our rescue, or
 come to our demise - either way our only hope was to make something
 happen.  Meanwhile we were forced to wait while Gina suffered in
 silence to the taunts and untoward suggestions of our kidnapper.
<p>    "So my little chickadee, you're in quite a mess.  Perhaps you
 should say your prayers." he chuckled.
   <p> "Sir you are the one in need of prayers.  Why are you doing this?
 Were you born evil or were you always this way?", Gina said, obviously
 flustered.

<h3>11/29/93</h3>
    "Well, it looks like you're gonna be making trip numero tres sooner
 than you think, if you don't leave us alone!" As Gina made this retort,
 I couldn't help smiling at her spunk. Egads, I realized how quickly we
 had bonded and that there was much that I didn't know about her.
<p>
"Heh heh...fellas, now there's a woman that'll curdle your cream and
 flatten your damn pancakes. It almost makes me feel bad to do what I'm
 about to do..."
<p>
"Hey, we didn't mean to get in your way," I reasoned, "we were just
 hanging out and..."
<p>
"Hangin' out all right - not that I blame ya' for wantin' to kiss
 them sassy lips o' hers. I got an itch to do the same thing..."
<p>
Regina recoiled but one of the silent partners held her tight. I
 said, "Not while I'm alive you won't!" Inside, I questioned greatly the
 necessity of saying something so dramatic. She looked at me for a moment
 and then her eyes flashed anger as the big man roared in laughter again.
 He was enjoying every minute.
<p>
"Boys, tie 'em up! I hate to do it, but these two look like trouble.
 And hey...don't think of screamin' cause I got a 25,000 volt cattle prod
 right here that'll send a quick signal to your whole body to shut up!"
<p>
"We don't give a rat's ass about your threats!" Gina and I exclaimed
 in unison as we were being bound, struggling all the while. Big Man
 shook his head for a second and laughed again.
<p>
"Stereo response. Did you two practice that on one of yer little
 dates in the hills?" he asked.
<p>
They tied us up both hand and foot, and let us lay there on the hill-
 while they talked quietly off to one side. I couldn't hear what they
 were saying.
<p>
"Are you o.k.?" I asked Gina. She couldn't even roll over to face me
 so I had to assume that a angry sounding grunt meant that she was.
<p>
I hummed a couple bars of 'Us and Them' by Pink Floyd and tried not
 to worry too much about our fate. I reasoned to myself that if these
 thugs were really gonna harm us (I mean, besides forceably tying us up),
 they would've probably done it by now. Also, I had this unexplainable,
 gut-type feeling that the Big Man was not an evil man - he was just a
 rough character who liked to ruffle people's feathers, especially pretty
 ones with nice curves and brown hair.
<p>
Shortly, they returned and picked us up by the shoulders and feet and
 began to carry us further up the hill. Looking up at the midnight blue
 that appeared faintly beyond the tree limbs overhanging their route, I
 thought about all that had occurred during my first day here, and more
 than anything else, I knew that I wanted to see another sunrise, if only
 to see my beautiful friend's face one more time in the bright sun.
<hr><h3>11/29/93</h3>
 I tried not to feel overdramatic, as they half-carried us up the big
 hill, in my mind the hill of Calvary.  The symbolism of the day ending
 as my life was ending brought tears to my eyes and I realized anew
 how difficult it was to get tears off your cheeks when your hands are
 tied.  I had to rub my face against Gina's hair, which was not an
 unpleasant endeavor.
<p>
  "Gina," i whispered, "we need to break loose don't you think?"
<p>
  "Na baby na, don't cry-"
<p>
  "I'm not," i protested a bit much, "it's my contacts!"
<p>
  We both chuckled despite our dire circumstances.
<p>
  "Listen, I think I can charm the fat one.  I think he's really
 a bozo who just fell in with the wrong poncers," she said.
<p>
  "Poncers?"
<p>
  "Poncers is Sudanese for 'those who would do wrong'. sorry, for-
 got you weren't hip to that!".
<p>
  "Gina, i trust you to do whatever you can, but be careful..."
 She smiled broadly and made eye contact with Fatso.
<p>
  "Hey guy, what are you doing with these lowlifes?  I sense in you
 greatness - you're like shakespearian character!".
<p>
  The big guy grumbled but appeared interested, thinking perhaps
 he reminded her of a prince or king, "oh yeah?  who?".
<p>
 "Falstaff," she said hiding her merth.
<p>
 "Er, was he a King?" he asked.
<p>
 "No, but he was a very important person.  Wasn't he, Johnathon?".
<p>
 "Oh yeah, Big Man on Castle.  Basically the kinda guy you'd like
 to sit down and drink a few at the trough with."
<p>
 The fat guy grunted and looked away but then said, "actually that
 doesn't sound like a bad idea.  Why don't we play strip poke-her and
 give da' lady a head start!".
<hr><h3>11/30/93</h3>
<p>
"Untie me, hon, and we'll see...but you got to wine and dine a
 woman first, don't ya' know?" Gina said sweetly.
<p>
"Maybe I will and maybe I won't. You strike me as the kinda woman
 that don't need much winin' and dinin'."
<p>
"Big Boy, you're so charming and handsome! I bet the women are just
 crawlin' all over you. Tell these lowlifes to untie me so I can hug
 your big, strong neck." She batted her eyelashes at him, and I could
 sense her trying hard not to break out laughing. I could do nothing but
 watch and listen in the dark. I couldn't even begin to figure out her
 plan.
<p>
Falstaff almost doubled over with loud guffaws when she said this.
 His laugh sounded just like Santa Claus must sound when he watches the
 elves trip over their work after drinking his secretly spiked Kool-Aid.
 He enjoyed seeing us squirm.
<p>
"Hey, dude," I said, "I didn't catch your name."
<p>
"It don't matter much now, don't it...so I'll tell ya'. It's Jimmy
 Beam Pritchard, and these fellas here are my boys. Hey, Sammy, you're
 losin' more of them Raisinettes out of your back pocket." He yelled
 to one of the silent ones carrying us.
<hr><h3>12/01/93</h3>
<p>
 Our heads turned towards Sammy and we watched as assorted Goobers
 and Raisinettes fell from his pocket like rain everytime he moved.
<p>
 "I'm losing these on purpose. I'm leavin' a trail in case
 we's get lost!" Sammy said.
<p>
 "DUFUS!!," stormed Jimmy Beam, "you're also leaving a trail for
 anyone else who might be looking for our 'clients'!" His fingers
 curled in that annoying hand-signal people use to denote quotation.
 "Gees can't take you anywheres.  Good help is hard to find, just like
 a good woman is hard to find - right babe?"
<p>
  He slowly untied Gina and she put her hands in his front pockets
 and murmured "yes".  I could tell he was smitten by the way his eyes
 glazed over.  He was going through the unmistakeable signs of a man
 being taken over, body and soul, by a woman - the amazing sight of
 a man with twice the physical strength of a woman giving way to her
 slightest whim, displaying the defect in men that allows women to rule
 the world.  In short, he was instantly henpecked.
<p>
  "Uh..that feels so good," his eyes lidded over as she got even
 closer.
<p>
  He then focused on his partners.
<p>
  "Boys get lost! This ain't no motion picture show!  Get a camera
 it'll last longer!  I mean it - scatter!," he bellowed.
<p>
  Sammy and the boys vanished.
<p>
  "Jimmy Dean," i said, "if you can untie me I promise I'll just
 take a walk and leave you two alone."
<p>
  "My name's Beam!  And there's no way-"
<p>
  "Jimmy," Gina said, "let him go...we need privacy don't we big
 guy?".
<p>
  "Yes, er...I guess so," he said, her influence on him like a drug.
<p>
  Jimmy untied my hands in one swift motion.
<hr><h3> 12/02/93</h3>
<p>
He stood there for a second as if contemplating what he really
 meant to do next. Gina was looking at me and motioning me away. Leaving
 her to be ravished by this big brute was never an option for me.
<p>
So I said, "Now, let's try to work things out like responsible
 adults. Jimmy, I can't believe that you mean to do us harm...what have
 we done to deserve this treatment at your hands?" Then I had an idea so
 simple and brilliant, "I'll give you a lifetime supply of Butterfinger
 candy bars...for the girl."
<p>
He looked at Gina as she shrugged her shoulders. Obviously, she
 had given up on the charm deception thing.
<p>
His face became serious, and for the first time, a spark of genuine
 intelligence crossed his large face. He stood there for a minute looking
 at the both of us, and I thought of grabbing Gina's hand and making a
 run for it. Maybe we could get away from him.
<p>
Instead, I said, "I'll throw in some Pirates season tickets and a
 Doug Drabek rookie card..."
<p>
He smiled and said, "You kids are alright...I didn't mean to trouble
 ya' too much. But I had to know if you was the ones or not, and scarin'
 ya' seemed pert near the best way to do it."
<p>
"What do you mean by 'the ones'?"
<p>
"Well, over the last few months, someone's been been stealin' my
 cattle. My cattle lots are just 100 yards or so further up the trail.
 We can't seem to catch 'em, but I'll tell you what's the truth, nobody
 steals cattle from Jimmy Beam Pritchard and gets away with it!" His face
 was dark and ominous now - the boyish amiableness was gone.
<p>
"I'm sorry about that - I can assure you that Gina and I have nothing
 to do with it."
<p>
"Why don't you two come in for some breakfast. Mrs. Pritchard's the
 finest cook this side of the Ohio River. It's the least I can do after
 scarin' ya' like that." He pointed to a farmhouse that was just becoming
 visible thru the trees as the early morning sky began to change to a
 lighter shade of midnight blue. We said that it sounded good to us and
 followed him to his home.

<hr><h3> 2/1/94</h3>
<p>
 We followed Jimmy Beam Pritchard through orchards that had the
 aroma of apples with Worchester sauce.  It became clear we were
 actually inhaling the quiet domain of Mrs. Pritchard, or Ms.
 Pritchard as she called herself after reading one of the woman's
 magazines that came to her house on a monthly basis.
<p>
"How-deee thar folks, well I do say I wasn't a-spectin' nobodies!"
 Ms. Pritchard said.  Obviously the magazines had little impact on
 her speech I thought to myself.
<p>
"Sally Jean, I accused these two youngsters of stealin' my
 cattle, and I believe I owe them a hot breakfast!  This here's Gina,
 and...and...what'd you say your name was son?"
<p>
"Johnathon."
<p>
"Oh yeah, John Bonds, JB - like Jimmy Beam!" he said with an
 overexuberance that expressed just how proud he was of himself.
<p>
We sat down to a simple brunch of bacon, eggs cooked with Jim
 Beam and for dessert a perfect apple pie.
<p>
"Y'all should be careful 'round here, " Jimmy said, "there's
 strange sh-t going on.  I had a feller on my cattle drive last
 year that said he saw a space ship!  I told him to get on home,
 he's seen too many cattle drives."
<p>
Gina and I looked at each other and shared a secret laugh.
<p>
"Well sounds like he did stay a little too long on the range.
 I've heard of cowboys looking at the cows kinda funny, but never heard
 of seeing space ships," I said.
<p>
After eating we said our goodbyes and Gina gave Jimmy a quick
 kiss, which in turn caused Ms. Pritchard to kiss me.  In fact,
 Ms. Pritchard salivated in my mouth which caused me to buckle backward
 and wonder if maybe Ms. Pritchard had stayed a bit too long on this
 lonesome homestead.
<p>
 "Nice people...salt of the earth," said Gina.
<p>
 "You are right mam!  So are you gonna tell me what that device
 you've so deftly hidden on your left hip is for?"
<p>
 "Johnny, you were not supposed to see that."
<p>
 "I see all when it comes to you.  I know every curve, every
 nuance of skin, every gradation.  So don't try to hide anything!
 I even know the exact location at which your back becomes buttock.."
<p>
 "Johnathon Bonds!  That is just not appropriate," she said
 while smiling.
<p>
 She pulled out the tiny device and held it over her left thumb.
 Immediately I heard the sound of voices speaking an alien language.
 I was being fadered through time, although I didn't know it at that
 point.  All I knew was that I had the sensation of flying while
 being firmly on the ground.  And the sensation that Gina was not
 quite telling me everything.
<p>
 "Relax Johnny, you'll never forget your first fader," she said
 tongue firmly planted in cheek, "I told you that I am involved with
 the Cabootan's and I need to check in with them.  I hope to recruit
 you, but they have your doubts about you."
<p>
 "What doubts?"
<p>
 "You are 100% human, and thus to an extent unpredictable.
 I'm 50% Cabootan, which makes me a little more trustworthy.
 I'm not saying we Cabootan's are machines, but we have eliminated
 crime, have clean streets, and would never be caught dead watching
 "Regis with Kathee Lee".
<h4>
Captain Cajun was in a bind. First, an assistant had accidentally set
 the portable transgalactic communicator right on top of his Ray-Bans
 which he had placed on the corner of the desk. He only had time to say
 "why I oughtta..." as the offending party left the room. Herthang Cajun
 was a Cabootan, and Cabootans were friendly people and full of patience.
 He looked sadly at the squished glasses only half of which were visible,
 the other half pulverized under the heavy weight of the communicator.
<p>
And then there had been the message from his home planet of Caboot.
 He was to depart within 2 solar days whether or not he had been able to
 reclaim one of their most promising prospects. The current shipment of
 humans was desparately needed in Caboot.
<p>
As if that wasn't enough for a red-eyed Cabootan to take, the tracer
 alarm of Ms. Hapsburg had gone off which meant that she was in some kind
 of trouble. He sent eight of his men to find out what was going on, and
 reminded them to be careful to avoid detection. They could not afford
 to let the earthlings of Lebanon, Pennsylvania know that they had alien
 intruders among them. Even though their intentions were peaceful, the
 abduction of steinbergs would not be seen as a friendly gesture by the
 earth people.
<p>
The most disturbing thing, however, was the report by scouts that
 Ms. Hapsburg's apartment had been bombed...
<p>
"Sir, we have traced the alarm beacon to an old farmhouse just out-
 side of town. Ms. Hapburg and the steinberg have gone inside. They do
 not appear to be in any danger. Awaiting your orders, sir." This message
 came over the ships comlink. It was addressed to him from the party that
 he had sent out to reconnoiter.
<p>
"Wait until they leave, and then bring them here. Use the fader unit
 to transport if you have to, but get them back here quickly and safely."
 Captian Cajun hoped that things would start to go his way again. He
 looked at the bowl of breakfast cereal (he liked the particular human
 brand of Cocoa Pebbles) that was fast becoming a soggy mess. He grabbed
 a spoon, took a big bite and sighed...assignments to Earth did have
 some perks.
<hr><h3> 12/02/93</h3>
<p>
 Herthang contemplated his crushed Ray-Bans and wondered aloud
 why it was that they could put a Cabootan on Pluto's moon, but
 couldn't artifically whiten their eyes.  He examined the monogrammed
 glasses and cursed his parents anew for naming him "Herthang"
 with all it's baggage.  It seemed to him that his parents must've
 been doing some brown acid space dust that day.  Team member Horton
 interrupted his thinking.
<p>
"Cap'n, sir!  I believe I've heard something in the geotransmitter
 that may prevent our successful transmission!" Hortie said.
<p>
"Horton what did you hear?" the Captain said scoffingly.
<p>
"Not what, sir but who-".
<p>
"You heard a who?  Horton hears a who?!!", and the Captain
 rolled onto his side as the chagrined Hortie watched the chortling
 Herthang.  Wiping tears from his eyes, finally the Captain got back up.
<p>
"So sorry Horton, continue please!"
<p>
"Anyway, I heard the unmistakeable sound of our enemy the
 Hossenpheppers talking on the intrafrequency network, and they hinted
 that they'd found a way to block the neurotransmitting capability of
 our mass collider program thus stopping any DNA movement."
<p>
"That tis ponc!," yelled the irate captain.
<p>
"Sir, what's that?"
<p>
"Nevermind, just something I picked up from some of the earthlings.
 I find it an onomonepia, meaning it sounds like what it is.  But that
 is no concern, we must immediately try to fader Ms. Hapsburg
 on board and see if they've succeeded to block it.  Then we must
 hope that we can be geotransmitted back to Caboots, where the
 people are friendly and the girls are above average."
<p>
 The geotransmittal room looked as if a geothermal thunderstorm
 had struck it.  All over were signs of beaurocratic red tape, including
 actual rolls of 8 mm. tapes with the word 'red' taped on them.  Large
 stacks of papers called "long sheets" were present as well as shorter
 pieces appropriately called "short sheets".  All of them
 had signatures on them, which were required (in triplicate) any
 time a program (aka alien) was being transmitted from the field to
 Caboots or vice-versa.  Horton stopped by to talk to the assistant,
 a wise-cracking alienette named Arista.
<p>
 "Arista, we have difficulties.  We need to fader Ms. Hapsburg
 immediately and then all of us must be transmitted to Caboots.  I
 fear if we don't act immediately we will be blocked by the Hossen-
 peppers and never go back to our sweet homeland where the people
 are friendly and the girls above average."
<p>
  "Sorry dude. You know the rules.  Do the paperwork, get it
 signed, kiss my feet and maybe I'll let you go," Aries said dryly.
<p>
  "Ms. Teal," he said, controlling his anger, "i fear you don't
 realize the importance.  You, yourself may never set foot in Caboot
 again if you don't expedite this matter!"
<p>
  "Hey blow off, chow boy!  I ain't here on business babe, I'm
 here on fun.  But if my own pretty redneck is on the line, maybe
 I'll cut you some slack.  Proceed at your own risk."
<p>
   With that Horton proceeded to fader Gina (can you say that in
 a novel?) and Gina magically appeared before him, her seductive lines
 and jackknife curves tangible on board.
<p>
   "Hortie!  Egads!  Why did you fade me and not Johnathon?" she
 asked.
<p>
   "Oh yes, quite right.  We'll fader the steinberg also.  I regret
 to inform you that we need to test our transmitter to see if we can
 still get to and from Cabootan."
<p>
  With that he fadered me.  I fell into Gina's arms and she planted
 a right hook to my temple.
<p>
  "Very good Gina," Hortie said, "you seem to be getting the hang
 of that."
<p>
  "Well it was most unpleasant as I'm very fond of him.  Where's
 Herthang?"
<p>
  "The Captain is involved with those prehistoric Cocoa Pebbles.
 I do fear for his sanity, as I heard him mouthing the words 'coo-coo
 for Cocoa Puffs' over and over.  My word, if you're going to whistle
 commercials at least get the right cereal!"

<hr><h3> 12/29/93</h3>
<p>
To be a Hossenphepper was to be a warrior - there was no debate
 about that among any race that knew of their existence. And you were
 sure to know of their existence if they knew about yours. An innate
 character trait of all Hossenpheppers was the desire to conquer
 and destroy other lifeforms apart from their own. They were the
 Darwinian catalysts of the universe - they forced other lifeforms
 to fight for their existence. If an alien race's desire for life was
 strong enough, they would discover ways to successfully fight the Hos-
 senphepper. If not, they would be swiftly exterminated. The Hossenphep-
 bent towards destruction was builtinto them like quality into a GMC
 truck. One couldn't really say they were evil since they were just doing
 what they had been designed todo.
<p>
Hossenphepper philosophy was constructed upon the foundational
 premise that life was one big video game. Their optical scanners or eyes
 only saw 2-dimensionally - mathematicians and physicists say they see
 in the y-z plane which meant that they could see completely through
 objects but they had no sense of width as we know it. Their eyes rotated
 360 degrees around the middle of their torso and sent a signal to their
 brain which constructed a three dimensional image of the immediate sur-
 roundings.
<p>
The video game of Hossenphepper life had only one rule: Destroy any
 lifeform that comes within your 3-d view provided, of course, that it
 was not a fellow Hossenphepper lifeform. They derived a great sense of
 satisfaction whenever some other unfortunate lifeform stumbled across
 their path and they found the means to dispatch it. It was all just a
 game that they were constantly trying to get better at - a game they
 enjoyed playing almost as much as they enjoyed "quinking".
<p>
Yuuuu, a fine specimen of the above-mentioned race, was shuffling
 along with his buddy Alll, his eyes scanning rather quickly the terrain
 around him, even as he laughed at Alll's latest "quinking" tale.
<p>
"We'll see how you do tonight! For all your talking, one would think
 that you have been to Cabooties (as they called the planet of Caboot)
 and had your mind altered by the dreaded Steinbergs." They were on
 their way to do some quinking. Tonight was their last night here on
 Hossenphep before being sent out on a war mission.
<p>
They arrived at the quinking place and slinked inside.
<hr><h3> 01/24/94</h3>
<p>
"Hey Yuuu, Alll!" said a gregarious Hossenphep engaged in the act
 of quinking.  "Come join us!", he said.
<p>
Quinking was the Hossenphep equivalent of sex, although done in
 the sterile, antiseptic way that emodied almost everything they did.
 They made love like they killed - with little emotion other than
 glee, with neither guilt nor love.  The action itself involved
 having the neurons between their optical scanners meet and then
 revolve 360 degrees.  At the end of the circle, they had a small
 orgasm, which guarranteed the partners to have one and to have one
 together.  The one drawback was that the female sex would be blind
 for up to one hour due to a sensory overload. This resulted in fe-
 males sometimes not 'being in the mood' due to inconvenient down-
 time for their optical scanners, and thus the challenge to the
 male sex, and the challenge led to the usual boasts and quinking
 tales spoke of earlier.
<p>
"Hey Bite!!  Where's your buddy Meeee?"  said Yuuuu while Bite's
 head turned at a remarkably fast pace.
<p>
"Meeee's got guard duty at the Fort Braggadocia, should be here
 tomorrow."
<p>
Fort Braggadocia was the major bootcamp for training Hossenphep's
 in warfare techniques.  They were fully aware that as nature
 giveth, so it tooketh away, and did not take lightly the fact that
 someday a bigger & stronger race could do to them what they so
 gleefully did to others.  They knew that their Achille's heel would
 be their 2-dimensional vision, but were able to compensate for it
 by quickness in seeing 360 degrees.  Still, there toughest opponent
 had been the 4-dimensional seeing Analthugs, a group of Neandrathals
 from the galazy Woeisme.  They were freaks of nature for sure, but
 who could predict when an even more powerful freak of nature would
 appear?
<p>
 Just then a newcomer sidled into the quinking saloon. It was
 an alien life form glistening with tensile strength, with rippled
 white sides and the sterling silver handles of an ice-making
 General Electric Refrigerator.  The tension in the air was
 thick as sludge, and every quinker stopped dead in their tracks,
 some at 90 degrees, some even at 350 degrees - a nanosecond
 before orgasm.  How the life form got thru their defense system
 and managed to get to the bar was on no Hossenphepper's mind.
 Just the gluttonous pleasure of killing.  The unfortunate life
 form walked one step and was instantly sent into the twilight
 zone by 2 hundred cathorays from a hundred pairs of Hossephep eyes.
<hr><h3> 01/25/94</h3>
   "Got him!" yelled 10 or 11 of the killers in unison, and for a moment
 they completely forgot about quinking. There were hoots and hollers and
 high fives all across the room as each one related their prowess in the
 kill to each other.
   There was a fine silver mist that was slowly dissipating towards the
 ceiling, curling upwards like cigarette smoke, marking briefly the
 location where the alien met his quick and terrible fate. For the
 moment, noone noticed the small grayish black disk that lay partially
 hidden among the scant ashes on the floor.
   "It was a long shot from here, but I just knew that sucker was mine,"
 Meee was saying to Yuuu, Alll, and Bite. "Look at that beautiful cloud
 that rises over yon spot of ground - it's silver color is a testimony to
 my skill."
   "Shut up, Slow-Eye, you didn't even see it 'til it was just so much
 charred meat. Why do you think you never get picked for War duty? I was
 the one who took the unfortunate soul to his certain demise - he never
 knew what hit him! Thanks to my newest latest acquisition..." Alll
 pointed to a device that was completely covering his scanners as he said
 this.
   Meee ignored the insult, laughing instead as Yuuu and Bite locked
 scanners in preparation for a little quinking. It truly was a humorous
 sight watching quinkers.
   One Hossenphep near to the smoldering alien's ashes noticed the disk
 and moved to get a closer look. His scanners told him that there was
 something odd about the disk. And then his suspicions were multiplied
 when he noticed a little red light start blinking.
   He yelled out, "Boooooooooooommmmmmmmmbbbbbbbbbbb! I think its a..."
   Kaboom! Before anyone could move or scan, the nearest 15 or 20
 Hossenpheps were killed and nearly as many more were hurt as they were
 hurled through the air. Yuuu and Bite were thrown apart in mid scan,
 they had no idea where they were, while Meee and Alll felt like pancake
 batter splattered on the wall.
   "Steinbergs!" they yelled as they tried to extricate themselves from
 the rubble. "It's those bloody Steinbergs!"
   Sheer panic was overcoming everyone in the quinking hall, optical
 scanners were spinning wildly, as the Hossenpheps rudely attempted to
 exit. Meee watched as one of the smaller 'Pheps was shoved scanner first
 onto the floor, "Get outta my way ya' lousy steinberg lover!" yelled the
 one responsible for the unfriendly shove.
   "At least my scanners quink without giving pain to my partner, ancient
 obese one!" the little one yelled from underneath a quinking booth.
   The place was totally cleared out within five minutes, though nobody
 went too far away. Yuuu, Alll, Bite, and Meee stayed as the town's
 automatic cleaning system was alerted, by way of a computer link, of the
 mess of unfortunate Hossenphep's that had been killed.
   "I would've liked to have known more about that creature that carried
 the bomb - was it even real? Or was it just a decoy of some sort
 modelled after a real alien lifeform. My scanners didn't detect any
 falseness in the living tissue, but we all know that Steinberg
 technology is improving exponentially." Bite went on, "Why does everyone
 shoot first and ask questions later...?"
   "Bite, you got some wierd ideas in that organ you call your brain
 there, always questioning the kill, like some half-baked, crimey,
 Steinberg-lover. Your gonna get into some deep cabootie if you don't
 watch out. Noboby likes a wierdo!" Meee chided.
   "Wouldn't it be better for the war effort if we asked some questions
 before we pulverized them? - maybe we could learn something useful."
 Bite was trying to convince the others, and possibly himself, that he
 wasn't crazy. Where did these ideas come from, anyway?
<hr><h3> 01/28/94</h3>
<p>
Wherever they came from, the ideas wouldn't let him go.  He was
 a unique child, starting with his name, which his mother gave him
 when he bit Uncle Kuukie on the goosenheiter.  It left an indelible
 scar that Uncle Kuukie proudly showed everyone, as if it were a
 mark of affection.  Bite seemed to have a more questioning attitude
 towards authority, and at times he wondered if perhaps he was slightly
 more evolved than the others, as his nature was more thoughtful
 concerning the killing of aliens.  But was it a step
 forward or backward?  Was the tiny amount of compassion he felt
 a weakness?  Certainly the thought of using an alien in order to
 learn more was surely beneficial and a step forward, though he
 couldn't convince the others of that.
<p>
 "Hey Bite, bite this!!!" roared one of them, to the general
 delight of every quinker and quinkette.  The joke was almost as
 old as Bite himself, yet it never failed to bring the house down.
 Bite left the quinking palace neverously, because he was about to
 meet the Head Hossenphep - Herthang himself.  He took a quick
 shower to remove bomb debris as well to mentally cleanse himself from
 the seedy atmosphere of the quinking palace.  He put on his finest
 uniform, complete with military ribbons and regalia.  He knocked on
 the solid brass door of secretary Horton, through whom all audiences
 with Herthang were arranged.
<p>
"Horton?  Horton-hears-a-who?", the name had already stuck on poor
 Horton, and it was heard so often in the halls of Hossphepdom that
 it no longer sounded strange even when said in the serious tones
 of the ill-at-ease Bite.
<p>
"Yes?  Who brings himself to Herthang Cajun, Lord of the Hossen-
 pheps, world-class Cabootan spy, and all-around good guy?" he said.
<p>
"I am Bite Myass, son of Kissss & Grab.  I am here to warn of
 a possible alien lifeforms that can cover their machines with
 pseudo-living tissue which then mimic actual lifeforms."
<p>
"I appreciate this information.  I will arrange a meeting with
 Herthang immediately if not sooner.  Please wait here."
<p>
 Just then the disk that had lied smoldering on the quinkroom
 floor came flying headlong towards Bite.  It came inches from
 his head, seemingly missle-guided by the way it's course
 changed.  Herthang walked out of his back office, and with a timing
 that seemed reminiscent of a B-movie, found the disk right in
 his path.  It exploded into his gut, and with the force of a small
 hurricane, Bite was thrown clear of Herthang, some 60 feet away.
 Immediately a small group of onlookers and rambul-chasers gathered
 around Bite, giving him suspicious and questioning looks.
<hr><h3> 02/10/94</h3>
   "I didn't do it!", Bite said as he gingerly checked his body for
 damage, especially paying attention to his optical scanners. "That disc-
 bomb almost got me too..."
   He heard voices over near where he presumed Lord Cajun would be lying in
 a pool of Hossenphep slime, the consummate sign of termination. As he
 regained more of his senses, Bite realized, much to his surprise, that
 Cajun had survived the blast. How could that be? He himself had been more
 than twenty feet from the blast which had knocked him unconscious while
 the Hossenphep lord had been at the epicenter of the explosion. For a
 split second, he thought about the famous Hossenphep film character,
 Jayyymes Frond, who was famous for his ability to escape termination at
 the hands of hostile races. His curiosity began to overcome his pain as he
 struggled to right himself and then walked over to where the others were.
   "Confound it! Where's Horton? What's the matter with you people? Ain't
 ya never seen a Cabootan bomb go off...?" Cajun was huffing and puffing as
 he tried to pull himself together. He had been wearing some top-of-the-line
 body armor to which he surely owed his life, but he had not escaped
 unscathed.
   "Sir, you've been badly injured...maybe you better lay still and wait
 for the medics", Horton said as he surveyed the small crowd that was
 shuffling around in the debris of Cajun's outer office.
   "Horton? Is that you? I'm having quite a time getting my scanners to
 work...not to mention these infernal rambul-chasers and ne'er-do-wells
 that look upon me with dread even as they plot to steal my office
 furniture...my vision comes and goes, you see...Horton?"
   "Sir, I would say by the look of things that you have received extreme
 trauma to your occipital lobe...how I know that is a mystery to me (having
 never been to college) but I can say that you definitely got a bad knock.
 I don't think you'll be quinking anytime soon." At this last remark, a few
 of the onlookers let a chuckle escape, thinking to themselves: better him
 than me.
   "Horton, wait 'til I get my...oooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!" A chunk of
 ceiling material had come loose and fallen on one of the lord's limbs. He
 shook it off and continued, "I'll send you to Caboot without your
 disguise, and see how long you last in Steinberg-land! Which reminds me,
 where's the pup that we recruited...I was gonna meet with him today."
   "Lord Cajun, we really should attend to your wounds first...here come
 the medics now." Horton asked the others to leave as the medics entered
 the disheveled building, he noticed Bite at the last minute and motioned
 for him to stay.
   Cajun said, "Steinbergs! do I have a mission for the pup?! We'll turn him
 into more than a match for that Jonathan Bond and the charming Ms.
 Hapsburg! He will be their undoing...and thus the undoing of the whole
 Cabootan bunch! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA." And then he passed out from loss of vital
 slime.
<hr><h3> 03/28/94</h3>
<p>
 It was my first fader, and it was as exhilarating though anti-
 climatic as it was over in less than a minute. Gina put me at ease by
 alerting the menancing guards that I was with her, as well as
 by spraying a heavy perfume on me that she said would keep me from
 setting off the scent alarms.  Ironically, the aroma was a mixture
 of apples and Worchester sauce.  I drank the mix and it took me in the
 way-back machine to Gina and me's days with the Pritchard's out on
 their ole homestead.  It reminded me of Ms. Pritchard's salivating
 in my mouth, and I recoiled slightly at the memory.  But then I
 remembered the rolling hills and vales of their farm and the
 music "Suddenly...last summer" came to mind.  "Will summer never
 end, will summer never begin?..it takes me standing still...it
 takes all my will... when suddenly....last summer."  This segued
 neatly into another song, a country song, that went: "i shoulda
 been a cowboy...i should learned to rope & ride...mrs. kitty
 will you marry me, if i ask you twice & say pretty please?  She'da
 said yes in a new york minute, but my heart just wasn't in it...".
 I was in an acid-induced state, and looked at every flower and tree
 as if it were the most incredulous sight.
<p>
"JOHNATHON!  Johnathon's left the building!" Gina yelled.
<p>
"Oh, wow, mon.  Bit distracted.  With a fantasy life as rich as
 as mine, it deserves ample time to ripen.."
<p>
"Yes, I know you're buzzin'.  It is nice the first time.  But
 not now buddy, we've got aliens to see and steining to do!"
<hr><h3> 05/16/94</h3>
<p>
 The rambul-chasers came and whisked Herthang to the Inhospitable.
 He recovered briefly from his fainting spell, revived by a slime
 injection from a pair of medics.  He said as loud as he could muster,
 "bring me food!  real food, not the bland shit that passes
 for it at the Inhospitable!".  True to his core, even while his core
 was spilling, he thought of food.
<p>
 Meanwhile, the pair of medics continued working on Lord Cajun.
 He mumbled in pain when they retracted his spincter
 and replaced it with a paper-mache' one to be used until a spincter
 donor could be found.
<p>
 "Bite," Cajun moaned in a voice barely above a whisper, "we
 need to surprise Hapsburg and Bonds when they fader in.  I want you
 to telegraph Herr Buttahfinga and have him rendezvous with them
 at their most likely fader point.  Have him knife Bonds and 'cuff
 Gina.  I want her alive, and besides it'll be more difficult killing
 her since she's not completely human."
<p>
 Bite was suprised such a plum assignment would fall to him and not
 the more likely Horton.  He wondered if maybe it was a set-up and
 he might bite the big one too.  He cringed at his pun, but smiled
 at Cajun and nodded.
<p>
"Should I be present with Herr Buttahfinga at the killing?" he asked.
<p>
"Ya, I want you there in case something goes wrong.  Besides,
 both of them may be hard to handle for the Herr alone."
<p>
"Yes, sir."
<p>
Bite left Herthang but not before noticing a strange tatoo on
 his abdominal area.  The medics had ripped off Lord's clothes
 when replacing his spincter and exposed a small red tazmanian devil,
 under which said "Warner Bros", - an American cartoon company.  The
 letters "Warner Bros" when added together after being assigned
 equivalent English numbers - eg. A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc. - totalled
 166, the magic number held sacred by the arch enemy Cabootans, and
 Bite shook with excitement.  Surely Herthang was not a double
 agent, playing off both sides?  Nah couldn't be, he thought.  Must've
 gotten it years ago...although it did look to him of recent vintage,
 given the way the skin did not enlarge or distort the image.
<p>
 After summoning the chief of protocol to attend to Herthang's
 culinary request, Bite left and called Herr Buttahfinga.  Herr was
 a brutish fellow, who took pleasure in other people's pain.
<p>
 "Buttah, we need to stick it to Bond & Hapless, I mean Hapsburg."
 (It helped to humor the guerilla Herr.)
<p>
 "Aye, quink 'em, they're dead!"
<p>
 "Not so fast, we need Hapsburg alive.  You can kill Bonds.  He's
 an antique." (Hossenphep slang for earthlings).
<p>
 "Quink you! I'm offing the both of them."
<p>
 "These are direct orders from Lord Herthang.  You kill Haps at
 your own risk."
<p>
  This evidentally swayed Herr, as he changed tacs and
 enthused over ways to kill Bond.


<p>
   Meanwhile, Johnathon Bond lay in a heap rubbing his chin.
<p>
  "Did you-".
<p>
  "Yes Johnathon.  It hurt me more than it hurt you.  I had to
 clobber you so you wouldn't know our location.  It's a Cabootan thing,
 just being careful."
<p>
  "Gees Regina if you can't trust me then who can you?"
<p>
  "it's tough sometimes."
<p>
  "I feel like I'm in an old Batman rerun, where people are knocked
 out to avoid entrance to the Batcave.  Gees you'd think somebody would
 follow him back to the Batcave!  I don't see how-".
<p>
  "Ok Johnathon, focus with me, we need to be super-alert to alien
 presences.  My intuition tells me that we have something to fear."
<p>
  Just then Herr Buttahfinger leapt out at them as they walked
 along the fader route, and stuck a knife into Bond.
<p>
  "I'll finish 'im!" cried Bite.
<p>
  "Bite my ass, Bite Myass!", Herr said, uttering a line that
 cut Bite to the core.  Buttahfinga had spoken the unspeakable, the
 one line that brought to mind a million childhood rages.
 Like a serverd Achillies heel, Bite reacted with red-hot fury.
 He shoveled a lead ball into the Herr, knifing like buttah
 into his belly.  Herr grabbed his guts and died quickly.
<hr><h3> 06/01/94</h3>
<p>
 Bite felt regret almost immediately.  He tried to force Herr's
 guts back into his body but they slipped out, and he felt the stinging
 sensation caused by non-Hossenphep ectoplasm.  How could this be?
 He put it out of his mind and went back to kill Bond.  But he was gone.



<p>
 "Where are we?" Jonathan asked, groggy and weak from lack of
 blood.
<p>
 "I carried you here to Aunt Mame's barbeque.  Figured the smell
 of ribs would waken you."
<p>
 "This is no time for a joke - how could you carry a 180-lb man?"
<p>
 "Johnathon you know I work out!  Or maybe it's the Cabootan in me."
<p>
 "What?"
<p>
 "JB, I didn't want to tell you but...I'm half Cabootan.
 I have a earth mother and a Cabootan father.  Hmm, always wanted
 to say the phrase 'earth mother'..."
<p>
 "Can't you stay serious for even a flecko-second?"
<p>
 "I am serious.  I am half-Cabootan, which means I'm a little
 sharper in most of my senses than humans...Don't look at me like
 that!  Don't hate me because I'm Cabootan, hate me because I'm
 beautiful!"
<p>
 I gave an exasperated sigh while we cleaned up the wound.
 I wanted her to put alcohol on it, like they do in westerns, but
 neither of us drink much and so we didn't have any.  She put nail
 polish remover on it instead, and it hurt like hell.
   "I think we ought to go to a hospital, though I'm loathe to admit
 it," I said.
   "Okay, there's a hospital about three miles east of here.  I should
 tell you that we are currently in an earth simulation, on the planet
 Caboot.  The doctors are good so don't worry, but I'll understand
 if you want to fader to earth.  It may be safer here though, since
 obviously someone is trying to kill us there."
  "Gina, tell me the truth - why is somebody trying to kill us and
 why do the words of McArther Park elude me?  I've spent a lifetime
 trying to forget them, and now that I have it scares me."
  "Ok, you're entitled.  You have a war wound to prove it.  The fumes
from the nail polish I used cause you to slowly lose all memory.  Don't
fuss, it's just till we're safely ensconced on earth or North Caboot &
can check for bugs.  If we're captured, I think you may be a teller."
<p>
 "A teller?"
<p>
 "Yes, one who tells.  Like I said, your memory will be returned
and amplified when we're safe."
<p>
 "Gina?"
<p>
 "Yes?"
<p>
 "What's a teller?" I laughed at myself even though it hurt to do so.
<hr><h3> 06/24/94</h3>
<p>
 "Apparently the fumes weren't strong enough as I see you still retain
 full use of your twisted sense of humor. Just relax and keep your eyes
 open. Try to learn as much as you can about Cabootan society because
 you're probably gonna be here for quite some time - at least until the end
 of this war." Gina explained.
<p>
 "Why should I work so hard at remembering stuff when my mind's so
 messed up that it won't make any difference anyway? It's sortuv like that
 brainwashing the politicians use to convince us that the more money we pay
 into the government the better off we'll be.  It makes just about as much
 sense as a wolf trying to blow down a brick..."
<p>
 Regina broke in, "Jonathan, you're rambling!"
<p>
 I stopped talking and started walking in the direction where Gina said
 the hospital was located. So we were going east. Not that I could tell any
 difference between north, south, east, and west - it all looked the same to
 me. It was just then that I noticed that there was nothing like the sun to
 gauge your direction upon, and yet it was light, so that I could see clearly
 towards the horizon until my vision was lost in a diffused dusty
 rose-colored atmosphere.
<p>
 "How's come there's no sun up in the sky? This light has to come from
 somewhere, but I don't see any sun..." I began.
<p>
 "Don't see any sun?! Don't see any sun? What do you mean you don't see
 any sun?" She stopped to look at me.
<p>
 Then after thinking for a minute she did her best impersonation of a
 person "who could've had V8 vegetable juice" and while slapping her forehead
 said, "You 'don't see any sun' because we are WITHIN the sun! It's a long
 story and I don't think you'd get it in your current condition anyway..."
<p>
 "HOLD IT RIGHT THERE EARTHLINGS!" Bite jumped out into the open. He was
 looking rather perplexed in his assumed human disguise, but the revolver in
 his hand (also part of the disguise) looked real enough to Jonathan.
<p>
 Jonathan was more surprised than scared at the moment, and after a
 delayed reaction, due mostly to his knife wound and partly to his all
 engrossing conversation with Gina, he asked Bite, "Are you security around
 here or what?...hey, wait a minute! Aren't you that guy that was with that
 other guy that was tryin' to knock us off back there...why don't you just
 pull the trigger pal? why all this theatrical..." and then he fainted dead
 away.
<p>
 That was all the distraction Gina needed as she kicked the confused
 Hosenphepper in what she thought was his groin area. Little did she know
 that that blow almost killed him. Even though Bite outwardly looked
 like a human, his insides were Hosenphep, and the area of his body that
 corresponds to the human groin was even more delicate with vital tissue. As
 it was, he survived the blow, because the Disguise Division back home had
 thought that a protective cup was standard earthling attire and so had
 equipped him with one.
<p>
 Bite dropped to the ground in merciless writhing pain.
<hr><h3> 7/13</h3>
<p>
"DOL!!" he shouted at nobody in particular.  His countenance turned
 blue, another unique accuracy in the Disguise Division, who enjoyed
 a good kick in the balls just as much as the next Hossenphep.
<p>
"Why I outta!"
<p>
Gina took the opportunity to step on Bite's head and extract his
 gun.  She examined it and threw it back at him.
<p>
"Nice try - shootin' blanks huh guy?"  She snickered at the irony
 as the toy gun hit him just above what appeared to be his aching groin.
<p>
"So who are you?" she asked.
<p>
"Bite Myass," he answered.
<p>
"Excuuuse me?  You're in a rather precarious position to be hurling
 insults!"
<p>
"My name is Bite Myass.  Let me explain - I am a Hossenphep-"
<p>
At this Regina became enraged and she was about ready
 to finish him off since the Cabootan in her hated Hossenpheps
 for their murderous ways.
<p>
"Wait," he yelled, "I'm not a killer.  I dislike the ways of my
 race - really i do - and to prove it I'll kiss your feet."
<p>
Regina smiled despite herself.  A Hossenphep in desperate
 straits appealed to her sense of justice.
<p>
"You're kinda cute, though I know you're just assuming a form.
 Now that I know you're a Hossenphep it makes sense your groin aches!"
<p>
With that he knelt at her feet and began an awkward kissing motion.
 This tickled her feet, which she found sensuous.  She looked over
 a bit guiltly at Johnathon, who lay unconscious not five feet away.
 Bite slowly progressed up her leg, until he was uncomfortably close
 to her groin.  She still didn't trust him, but she couldn't stop.
 She wouldn't let him stop now.  She let her dress fall upon his
 head like a flower petal falling softly to earth.  He looked up
 through the fabric and saw big pink breasts shading him, looming over
 him like a lost Atlantis.  Her smell became overpowering, the juices
 of nature flowing out towards him.   As if her ripeness were too
 much for one man to take, Johnathon groggily began awakening.  Gina
 grabbed the silken hat off Bite's head and quickly clothed herself.
 Bite laid back on the ground.
<p>
"What happened?," asked Johnathon.
<p>
"We've run into a Hossenphep who looks to be changing his stripes.
 I think he was sent here to kill us, but now wants to be our friend,"
 she said, without irony.  'His name is Bite, Bite Myass, and he
 could be a great source of information.  That is your mission Bite,
 should you decide to accept it.  I hope it isn't more than you can
 chew.' They all groaned at the pun, finding bad humor universal
 in any culture.
<p>
"I will gladly accept it," and he proceeded to tell all he knew
 about Lord Cajun and Buttahfinga to Gina and Johnathon.
<p>
"Well now brown cow, we need a plan, a plan we need.  I'd say
 we need to lie low for awhile, have Bite report our killing while
 he gathers more information for us," Johnathon said.
<p>
They agreed and Bite left after a lingering look at Gina.  John-
 athon thought it odd, but said nothing.
<p>
"So are we inside the sun?  I remember little, but I do remember
 you vaguely saying we were inside the sun?"  Johnathon asked.
<p>
"Yes, we certainly are.  Although it's not our sun.  It's a smaller
 sun off Pluton that gives off very much less heat and light.  Even
 now we are protected from it by virtue of an invisible layer of skin
 that I applied while we were en-route.  This is a safe place, or so
 I thought until Bite appeared.  We need to be more careful, and I
 think earth itself might actually provide some spheres of privacy.
 Let's see...April in Paris?  Germany in June?  You know I'm pretty
 good at time-traveling too."

<hr><h3> 7/14 <-liar, liar pants on fire</h3>
<p>
Completing the walk to the hospital, they went inside where Gina informed
 the Cabootan staff that Jonathan needed immediate attention. Jonathan was
 guided to a private room, and because of the recent loss of blood to his
 system, he was hardly aware of anything going on around him. It seemed
 at times that he was quite lucid and would talk with the staff
 in a friendly gregarious manner, but this would quickly pass into periods
 of halucination with the frazzled earthman mumbling incoherent gibberish.
 All was unintelligible except for one word. An attendant leaned close to
 unbutton Jonathan's shirt at the same time trying to decipher the quiet
 rantings. The only word that could be made out of this delirious babble,
 heard as the Cabootan was bent close to his reclining form, cleaning his
 face and neck of blood, was "steinbergs".
<p>
 As soon as Gina was sure that Jonathan was receiving good care, taking
 five minutes of constant assurances from the Cabootan doctor in charge to
 convince her he would be o.k., and after asking the good doctor to recite
 the universal Hippocratic oath by rote, she left to update her superiors on
 the current state of affairs including the information about the Hossenphep
 spy ring that had almost thwarted the Cabootan master plan.
<p>
 As she walked briskly toward Cabootan HQ, she felt the care and stress
 of her recent assignment, which had been her first foray off of her home
 planet, melt away. To think that she had actually pulled the whole thing
 off during her debut in "the big show" (She laughed at her own reference to
 a phrase from the American culture from which she had just returned.). She
 wished Jonathan was with her so they could celebrate together at one of the
 Cabootan watering holes.
<p>
 Looking around, the similarity of this landscape compared to where she
 had just been, in spite of the hundred trillion or so miles separating the
 two places, that distance broken only occasionally by a Cabootan Taco Bell
 spaceport, was impressed once again to her mind. It helped her to
 understand in a small way why the humans from Earth might be able to help
 them in their struggle for survival against the Hossenpheps. She hoped, as
 she neared the security checkpoint that guarded the way into HQ, that she
 could find out exactly how the steinbergian humans brought back from Earth
 could help her race.
<p>
 She walked up to the unmanned checkpoint, placed her head in a small
 cavity, and watched the red glow as the machine identified her as a true
 Cabootan, the visible ray causing her eyes to glow fiery red. A voice
 prompted her for a password, she quietly mumbled "I like the Sprite in you",
 and then she wasn't there anymore. She had been fadered deep into the HQ
 building.
<hr><h3> 7/15  < yeah, right.</h3>
<hr><h3> he mumbled something he shouldn't have.  The incomprehensible word</h3>
 "steinbergs" had been replaced by "hossenpheps".  This caught the
 attention of attending physicians, but they thought little of it
 until he started stringing words like "plot" and "killed" and
 "bite myass" together.  The physicians let him go on until they
 pieced together what they thought he was saying: that humans on
 the planet earth were being sacrificed for the Cabootan cause.
 Being sensitive sorts, they were skeptical of governmental abuse
 of power, and hence were receptive to any perceived violation
 of rights.  In fact, they had recently signed petitions against
 the Cabootan government's use of the mood enhancing drug "Xeon" on
 Cabootan's poor - the petition title was "No Xeon for Peons!".
<p>
The physicians huddled to discuss what to do.  Immediately one of
 them, an aging surgeon whose mask was so tight as to retard oxygen
 to the brain said, "let's sign a petition.  No pep for a 'Phep!".
 He was ignored.  They finally agreed that doctor-patient confidence
 was appropriate, but did embed a small tracking device in his
 spleen subdivider.  Since this pouch is often jostled during sex, one
 doc said, "I always wanted to study the sex habits of humans -
 - think we can get any grant money?", to which another replied
 "not after our 'No Xeon on Peon' campaign!".
<p>
 Gina, or Regina, whatever the hell her name is, walked confidently
 into the HQ conference room.  She knelt and kissed the large
 Cabootan ass that was embroidered on the floor rug.  The others
 welcomed her and asked how her mission was going.
<p>
 "Very fine, I have some interesting news.  The Hossenpheps have
 a spy ring and came dangerously close to finding out the mission.
 The leader is a rather odd character who tried to kill Bonds."
<p>
 "Who?" asked one crusty grandfatherly-type into his snifter of
 brandy.
<p>
 "Bite Myass," she replied.
<p>
 At this the man looked up from his snifter and gripped it as
 if he would throw it, but then softened.
<p>
 "Well come here then."
<p>
 She came over hesitantly.
<p>
 "Turn around," he said as the engrossed audience watched.
<p>
 "Undo your pants."
<p>
 "What are you talking about-" she said, then added "Oh, jeez
  grow up, that's his name.  For Bootans sake!"
<p>
 "Oh...sorry...please continue then."
<p>
 "Anyway, Bite was assigned to kill JB, but ran into me and I
  incapacitated him.  We convinced him to become a spy for us,
  which seems on it's face ridiculous, but I have a certain suasion
  over him, if you know what I mean and I think you do.  I seem to
  have it over ol' Charlie here who was just about ready to
  kiss my ass!"
<p>
 They met for over two hours discussing strategy while Gina
  struggled to fan away the cigar smoke.  Bite was an unknown
  quantity, and they agreed they needed to meet with him and test
  him.  To do so Gina would meet Bite and tell him that
  a new fuel source had been found - fat earth people.  She would
  tell him that it could drop the Cabootan reliance on intergalatic
  fuel by over 50%.  Then they would carefully monitor Hossenphep
  reaction (if any).
<p>
  Gina rendezvous'd with Bite outside a Union 76 station in
  Hoboken, New Jersy.  They kissed briefly, and he made a reflexive
  quinking motion towards her.  Then she pointed out fat people,
  not a rare sight in Hoboken, and said one 300 person could power the
  city of Reboot for 20 days.  The fat could be converted to Poncnall
  simply by heating and then adding Freon.
<p>
 Bite was breathless, both from lust and the story she was
  concocting.  He was torn between loyalty to her and loyalty to his
  race, which still tugged at his heart, though his mind knew the truth.
  He promised not to tell, of course, but she couldn't see that
  inside his jacket his plier fingers were crossed.  She told him she
  had a business meeting in 10 minutes & the fader routes were clogged
  with orange barrels.  He looked at her quizically, not understanding
  the reference, so she just said goodbye and to wait for further
  instructions.   In less than a second she was back in front of the
  Cabootan elders.  She knelt again to kiss the Cabootan ass, another
  ritual developed by a superstitious people.  It began some 50 earth
  years ago, when during their first visit to earth they were mooned.
  Almost immediately afterwards, word came via their teleprompters that
  the Cabootans had won Hossenphep War XIV which gave them the belief
  that the mooning had caused the war to end positively.  On such
  whims tradition is born.
<p>
   "The trap is set.  Let the mice bring the cheese back to the
  Big Cheese, so that we know what we're dealing with.  Either way
  he can be used," said a heavy-set pale man.
<p>
   The next day they re-convened and all wore smiles except
  Gina or Regina, whatever-the-hell-her-name-is, because it was
  now clear that Bite had told.  Poncnall had fallen five
  points on the intergalatic market due to "huge sales by Hossenphep
  insiders."  Also over 30 people were declared missing in Hoboken,
  and all were over 250 pounds.  Gina sighed that her love be so
  easily cast aside, and vowed that she would never let him lick
  her feet again.  They all knew now that Bite could be used to
  bring disinformation to the 'Pheps, so Gina rendevous'd with him
  again, hiding her disappointment.
<p>
  "Hey Bite.  Bite my ass!," she said.
<p>
  "Yes?"
<p>
  "Listen got bad news on the fat people as fuel.  Our scientists
  found it doesn't work.  It was only theoretical anyway.  Turns out
  that the grease from all those McDonald hamburgers combusts with
  the Freon.  Just blows up - can't keep it as a steady fuel supply.
  So we're back to the drawing board."
<p>
  "Gina you're kidding...why I...that's terrible."
<p>
  "Indeed."
<hr><h3>  11/1/94</h3>
<p>
   "Something's not right...I...uh...don't know how to tell you this. My
  superiors say that something terrible is about to happen..."
<p>
   "Oh no! Letterman isn't moving to Fox! Tell me it isn't so!", Gina
  interrupted.
<p>
   "Hey, I'm serious! This is not a joke. You never listen to me
  anymore. Ever since you became 'Ms. Big Caboot'," Byte moved his fingers
  in the classic quotation gesture with his arms raised to both sides of his
  head, "you don't care about a word I say!"
<p>
   Regina stifled a yawn and for a split second thought about how good
  it would feel to be lying somewhere safe in Jonathan Bond's arms. She knew
  that THAT could only happen when the war with the Hossenpheps was over,
  and crucial to the Cabootans plans for ending that war was Byte and the
  information that he could give or misgive - depending on how you look at
  it.
<p>
   "I'm sorry, Byte. It's been quite a week for me. I would like to say
  that it's been a quiet week for me, but that could never be true
  considering all the mayhem going on. Isn't it funny how the difference of
  a couple of letters totally changes the meaning of the word? Take 'quite'
  and 'quiet' for instance, these two words are..."
<p>
   "Will you shut up a minute and listen to me? I can't believe how
  insensitive you are; you ramble on and on and on. Who cares about the
  difference between 'quite' and 'quiet'? Only a complete moron would ever
  get them confused!" Byte was blustering and Gina almost laughed out loud,
  but she kept a straight face.
<p>
   Bite continued, "I am trying to tell you that we may not have much
  time together. Not quality time, anyway. Not any of the kind of time that
  brings two people closer together. Sure, time spent shoulder to shoulder
  fighting on the same team for a worthwhile cause is good, but it isn't
  quinking time, that's for sure. I want to be with you! But there isn't any
  time...no time to smell the roses...no sugar for my coffee...no thyme for
  my tea..."
<p>
   Bite hesitated as if he were thinking of something, then said, "You
  know what? I just did one of your word things - time and thyme." He looked
  at Regina as if he expected her to rip off her clothes and throw herself
  at him, completely wowwed by his cleverness. Instead, she pretended to
  play the drums, doing an Anton-Figg-finishes-off-a Letterman-joke
  impersonation.
<p>
   "What do you mean? No time? Why is there 'no time'? She asked.
<p>
   "Because of the quasi-cosmological space anomaly headed our way!
  We're doomed...at least, that's what Hossenphep scientists say. This whole
  Universe is toast. We're gonna be cleaned out. Skinned!"
<p>
   "Wait a minute, Phephead! Slow down - you're not making any quinking
  sense. What are you talking about when you say quasi-cosmological space
  anomaly...?"
<p>
   "Q-CSpA, for short. Scientists, politicians, and programmers all
  have to have their cheesy acronyms. It refers to a physical phenomenon
  approaching our Universe that our scientists have been keeping a quinking
  eye on. They describe it to be like one of your Hoover vacuum cleaners,
  only in this case, the Universe is the carpet. It just 'cleaned' a
  parallel universe close to ours, and they said it looks like its veering
  our way."
<p>
   "That's impossible. How can anyone know what is going on outside our
  Universe. How do your scientists know? The Universe is so big! How can
  anybody see around it?"
<p>
   "I don't know. It has something to do with the Elvis Effect - that's
  what they call it. The Elvis Effect. I don't know a thing about it, but
  that's not important. What IS important is that you and I spend some
  quality quinking time together. Whaddaya say?"
<p>
   Gina clicked on her communicator and said into it, "Hapsburg ready to
  fader." To Byte, "I can't right now, but you must come with me and give
  this info to our people. I've got some other business to attend to." She
  was thinking only about her Steinberg man that she had left in a sorry
  state a couple of days ago.
<hr><h3>  11/5/94 (never gets old)</h3>
<p>
   In a time increment so small - so small ('how small is it!') that
  it dwarfs in smallness the time interval between when your brain
  realizes the car door is going to slam your fingers and the time it
  actually does - Gina was fadered into semi-oblivion, until she
  appeared yawing but fetching before the tribunal council.
<p>
   "Hey y'all, I'm here with Bite," she noted.
<p>
   "You may begin," said the Grand Poobah at the grand HQ, "but
  first let me add something.  We have been techno'ing your
  movements, both visually and auditorially.  We trust you, but
  felt it necessary for CYA purposes.  Personally, I find your
  choice of bedroom attire provactive but Cerone Bonaparte here
  wonders if you might not catch your death of cold."
<p>
   "You...you snakes!  The right to one's privacy is paramount
  on earth you weasely quinkin' shriveled egg-suckers!"  Gina cried.
<p>
   "We felt it necessary.  If it is any comfort, the evidence was
  destroyed upon viewing.  Your breastful body with it's willful
  breasts and pouting lips the shade of a burgundy wine will never
  be shown."
<p>
    "Thank you," she said sarcasticaly, "now can I leave?  You
  must know quinkin' everything."
<p>
    "Just one thing that bothers me.  While watching the techno-
  viewer we couldn't help noticing the one-dimensionality of most
  of you.  Bite, Johnathon, Gina - all of you express yourselves in
  wordy, rambling, sarcastic sentences that show a disregard for
  seriousness, or seriousity, if i may make up a word on the spot!
  Hey pretty cool huh?"
<p>
   Gina sat down slowly, even gravely.  Her world felt crumbly
  beneath her, like an overmoist grandcracker pie. DOL!, she mused,
  even her thoughts!  She felt exasperated at the nitemare of her
  every movement viewed on a surround-sound SuperX 60-inch screen.  She
  thought back to everything she'd done, every potentially embarrassing
  action.  And now to think that the Grand Poobah was babbling on about
  one-dimensionality?  What was that sh-t she wondered?  Where
  was that coming from?  Didn't they know about the drug?  The drug
  that made them all take on a similar personality?  How it had
  infected the 'Phep water supply about the same time it made it's
  way into the local hotdog seller outside the Steinberg monument?
  She gasped at the ignorance of the Poobah.
<p>
 "Did you ever think," she thought about pausing there indefinitely
  but continued on, "that maybe the Lixium that the triple-agent hot
  dog vendor spiked his dogs with also made it into the Hossen's
  water supply?  And that drug might produce similar proclivities,
  such as my heightened sex drive and rambling pointless sarcasm?"
<p>
  The Poobah looked amazed for a minute and then asked how that
  would be possible.
<p>
  "Well Poo, it's like this.  Listen up, & listen up good.  LIke
  I said, my sex drive has been high.  I went to a quinkin' bar on
  one of my faders to Phep-land & I went looking for a quick quink.
  Hey, I'm not proud of it - I see your scowls and wear them as a
  badge of honor.  Anyway, their interest in me was underwhelming.
  In a moment of pique, I added Lixium to their water, figuring
  it would help me out the next time I was looking for a quink."
<p>
 She winked while saying the word 'quink', and one of the elders
  slumped over, saying he wished Clarence Thomas would leave the Court.
  Then he died.
<hr><h3>  1/9/94</h3>
<p>
 "How dare you...!" There were some mumbles and muffled outrage at her
  misdeed, but most of the council members weren't even paying attention,
  shuffling quickly to remove any valuables that might be on the cooling
  body of their dead member.
<p>
 "I was in a bind at the time, and a woman's got her needs - i think you
  know what I'm talking about here", a couple of the scavaging council
  members glanced up at her, proof that they had been listening out of the
  corner of their ears, "but there is a much more important matter that
  needs to be discussed..."
<p>
 "Discussed? discussed? What do you think we are, young lady? Some
  neighborhood sewing club? That has nothing to do but drink tea and talk
  about greedy baseball players? I am not aware of you knowing any matters
  to bring up that I don't know...!" Grand Poobah was getting himself all
  worked up.
<p>
 Regina interrupted, "Do you know about Q-CSpa?!?"
<p>
 "I sure do...it stands for quasi-cosmological space anomaly. I don't
  know anything about it, but I absolutely positively know the acronym. The
  key to modern leadership and management, be it corporate or judicial or
  military, is to be well acquainted with acronyms. I've found that in most
  cases, I don't need to know any real useful information to be successful,
  I just need to know when to insert the proper acronym.
<p>
 "Surely, beautiful miss, you remember such Cabootan national projects
  as NAFTA, HMO-FREE, ICP, TUVM, and KMFD..."
<p>
 Regina broke in on his rapidly expanding exhortation again, "Sir, they
  were all Cyrrhian-type victories - programs that were paid for by
  enslaving a large portion of the peoples they were supposedly designed to
  help."
<p>
 "And they did eventually help people", Poobah enjoined.
<p>
 Regina was not detered, "Sure, so did the transcontinental railway way
  back in ancient American times on Earth...but what the price to the
  developers? And, I'm not talking about the select few with the money and
  leisure to pull off such a feat; I'm talking about the immigrant laborers,
  the despised and downtrodden who, in many cases, gave their lives for some
  silly out-moded, land-hugging, fossil-fuel-hogging, air-polluting
  means-of-transportation."
<p>
 "The price of progress...", Poobah started to say only to be bowled
  over by the ongoing tirade of the beautiful woman standing before him.
<p>
 "THE PRICE OF PROGRESS!?! You say that like it was just piffle. People
  gave their lives, and so it has continued to this day. Think of some of
  the massive galactic projects that have been 'good' to intelligent life
  over the past 500 years: Ringdo discovered the carbonite galaxy that we
  call HostessTwinkieWorld (thanks Hostess!) and some Cabootans have been
  eating well ever since. The only price is the lives of the unfortunate few
  who have literally died on the spongy-breadlike surfaces of the planets
  in that galaxy. (Sure, now we've been secretly exporting this product to
  earth for years and selling our Cabootan products under the cover name of
  Hostess, and it generates quite a nice revenue due to the number of law
  enforcement officers, but shouldn't we be concerned about those who are
  giving their lives to produce a decent Hostess Twinkie...?"
<p>
 "Hold it right there, Ms. Hapsburg! You will not use oxymorons in my
  presence. Acronyms are o.k., but that's where I draw the line. Hmmm...
  let's talk about Q-CSpa...you were going to tell us something about it."
<p>
 Regina was trying to catch her breath. She wanted to finish her
  argument against mindless leadership by describing the absurdities of the
  Cabootan Hands-Across-The-Galaxy Initiative, the Tie-A-Red-Ribbon-On-Your
  -Spacecraft to show support for the Cabootan Rainbow Coalition, the
  Acronym-Way-of-Life Movement, and the Mandatory-Saturday-As-A-Work-Day to
  promote the Earth-based ICP project.
<p>
 Her chest was heaving from the exertion of maintaining a loud, firm
  voice for the council. As the sweat ran down slowly between her breasts
  and shoulder blades, she wondered why she even bothered. Where was
  Jonathan? Was he o.k.? Would she ever get to hold him again? He knew how
  to make her laugh. She slowly sat down across the table from the council,
  and felt the soft cloth of the chair on her bare legs. She realized that
  it must have looked rather odd for a female Cabootan to be attired in a
  tank top and Daisy Duke shorts engaged in serious formal conversation
  before the tribunal council.
<hr><h3>  1/20/95</h3>
<p>
  She tugged at shorts that barely covered her navel, but to no avail.
  The tight red shorts were worn for Johnathon, whose memories of
  childhood flooded back whenever he saw her in them.  The summer nights
  in front of the comforting light of the TV, everything seeming to
  be magical, watching the hopelessly erotic and exotic Daisy Duke
  hop into the General Lee.  He told of the almost unbearable hunger,
  the craving, that caused a certain peristalsis within him whenever
  he saw Daisy.  But to wear such an outfit in front of the stuffy
  Tribunal begged for trouble, and trouble she had.  One lay dead,
  apparently caused in no small way by her feminine power.  Power
  wielded so freely and casually that she'd forgotten she had it.
  And so she sat demurely, legs crossed and tightly held together,
  in anticipation of her possible dismissal as a Cabootan agent.
  She noticed the sweat had left her nipples soaked, so she discretely
  reached beneath her tank top, unhooked the bra and wriggled free.
<p>
 "Miss Hapsburg, what are you doing?" asked the Head Braumeister.
<p>
 "What-".
<p>
 "Nevermind, let's just proceed!  Now, this is your assignment -
  I want you to visit Johnathon and then meet at the Memorial.  I
  know you're ready to get back to earth, not to mention a cold
  shower.  You're fortunate we don't dismiss you from this case!"
<p>
 "Thank you sir, may I have another?"
<p>
 "What?!"
<p>
 "Just an earth joke.  I will fader myself out."
<p>
 With that Regina went to the bedside of Johnathon who was
  almost fully recovered and enjoying a hearty dinner of SPasoplasm.
<p>
 "Oh...Oh....OH Regina," Johnathon moaned between bites.
<p>
 "Yeah I thought you'd like this.  Haven't seen it for awhile huh?"
<p>
 Johnathon nodded and then his head began swimming.  Parts of his
  body began to disappear, to fader in and out.  The doctors had given
  him the drug Zeckvenom which had the unfortunate side effect of
  fadering people back in time if they wished it hard enough.  They
  lost two patients last year in their sleep, when their subconscious
  pined for some lost youth.  The doctors were worried that they would
  side effect.  In a closed society, such information was routinely
  hidden.  So it was only by accident that some patients became time
  travelers, and John was on the verge of it by virtue of his
  youth spent watching Daisy Duke.
<p>
  "Johnny what's happening to you?" asked Regina, "why are you
  fadering?"
<p>
  Johnathon immediately became fully present.  "I don't know.
  I was just thinking about how great it was to be a kid.  Everything
  so intoxicating.  Or at least in hindsight - like your hind's sight!".
<p>
  She slapped him playfully and then explained the plan.  But
  Johnathon still imagined the peruile wonders of a another world.
  Who could have thought that he would live more than one lifetime?
  There were precious few similarities between the person he was at
  age 9 and the person he was now - except for Daisy, and his mind's
  eye returned to iconic images that he could not rub away.  A world
  that for a moment was perfect and complete.  In a wisp of a moment
  he was gone.
<p>
  Johnathon was shrunk to less than half his normal size.  The
  ground reared up at him, hedges became tree-like, and there was
  a skateboard beneath his feet.  He slipped and hit his knee on the
  sidewalk. There was an indentation of a sneaker & the inscribed date
  6/71.  There was a lady's voice coming from a record player next
  door - "I've got a brand new pair of roller skates.."  His favorite
  babysitter, Linda, who he'd had a crush on for eons was coming
  towards him.  Her legs suddenly loomed over him, slender and longer
  than any legs he'd ever seen.  She was wearing 60's style hot pants.
  He swallowed hard and felt as if he saw a ghost.
<p>
  "Johnny, did you hurt your knee?"
<p>
  She rubbed his knee and soothed it with long, gentle fingers.
  It felt to him like the softest kiss offered with the smoothest lips.
<p>
  "No, it's okay," he said, his voice an octave higher than usual.
<hr><h3>  01/20/95</h3>
His voice indeed sounded strange to him. It took a second for him to
 figure out that he was hearing the voice of a 9 year old Jonathan Bond...
 what's going on here? He moved his hand in front of his face and saw the
 spindly young fingers of his young hand...yep it was his hand - there was
 the scar from the time he had grabbed the spinning wheel of his bike,
 which was sitting upside down balanced on its handle bars and banana seat.
 The wheel's momentum had carried his hand under the fender before he could
 let go, causing a deep half-crescent gash on the back of his thumb. Five
 stitches. Ouch.
<p>
 "Are you sure you're o.k.? You look a little shaky." Linda knelt down
 beside him as she continued rubbing his knee.
<p>
 Jonathan compared how she looked to him now with his grown-up brain to
 how he remembered her. He was beginning to realize that he must be dreaming
 or hallucinating...why, sometimes, Linda's face blended into Regina's and
 then it was Linda again. He felt slightly alarmed, but he was more curious
 about this dream? that he was experiencing. What person doesn't dream of
 going back in time while retaining all of the wisdom of life's experiences
 lived up to the present point.
<p>
 She looked smaller to him than he originally remembered, even though
 she was quite a bit larger than his 9 year old frame.
<p>
 "Yeah...I'm alright...", he said as he slowly leaned over and gave her a
 kiss on the cheek.
<p>
 Linda seemed surprised. She stopped rubbing his knee and said, "You're
 so sweet! Too bad you weren't older..."
<p>
 Perhaps it was because Jonathan only thought he was dreaming, but he
 then reached out and slowly brushed his fingers across her firm breast
 noticing the softness through her T-shirt and bra.
<p>
 "JONATHAN...!", Linda's face had changed. It was Regina now looking at
 him with anger or alarm, he couldn't determine which.
<p>
 Then, Linda was back beside him again. She didn't look angry at all.
 She had a tiny grin on her face that she was trying unsuccessfully to hide.
<p>
 "...made you do that? You probably shouldn't go around doing that -
 most girls don't like being touched there by just anyone.", she was saying
 as she started to stand up.
<p>
 "I'm sorry. You look so inviting...uh...I want to feel you...do you
 have any idea how you look to me...?" Jonathan struggled to his feet, his
 bruised knee giving him a low throbbing pain.
<p>
 "Look, you're just a 9 year old kid - maybe a little precocious for your
 age - but still, you're way too young to be thinking about these things.
 See ya later." Linda turned and started walking down the sidewalk.
<p>
 Young Jonathan stood for a second mesmerized by the slinky way that her
 body moved, and then without knowing exactly what he was doing, he ran up
 behind her and grabbed at her fine bottom. He felt the silky tightness of
 young skin under her pants and quickly slid his hand down between her legs
 and gently rubbed his hand underneath...
<p>
 Suddenly, he felt moisture all over his body and a stinging sensation
 in his neck, and then he saw beautiful Regina leaning over him, peering
 anxiously into his face.
<p>
 "It's just a shot of puracane...we thought we were losing you", she explained.
<p>
 Johnathon smiled, but his head was spinning with the last image that he remembered: Linda turning around in complete shock.
<p>
 Linda's shock was only seconds old before the boy, her charge, seemed immediately changed.  One minute she had felt Johnathon's distinctly nonpeurile hand, which resuscitated feelings and longing she immediately became ashamed of, but now he appeared childish again.  She shrugged it off and wondered at a boy as changeable as the weather.
<p>
 Johnathon looked into Regina's agate eyes and immediately felt his hand slip up the silky wall of Regina's legs.  She slapped it away, not a bit nonplussed. 
<p>
 "I see the Puracane hasn't affected your sex drive, but look we have important business, or as I say when in the South, 'impotent bidness'.  Don't groan at me like that mister, you know it's the Lixium talking.  The Tribunal's been a pain, but I'll tell you about that later.  Right now I just want to get back to the Memorial.  Things seem to be coming to a head, one member of the Tribunal is dead and they seem to be edgier than usual.  Something seems to be going on but I just can't seem to put my quinker on it."
<p>
 Before Johnathon could mutter a word Regina had him up ou of bed.  He leaned on her for support, and then she fadered them to earth and Pennsylvania.  Johnathon quipped, "with your bra off it brings new meaning to the phrase 'Lebanon or bust!'.  They groaned in symphonic harmony.
<p>
 Lebanon, Pennsylvania wore dull colors.  The ground was a sort of perique brown, and the sky an indistinct mixture of soot and clouds.  People still gathered around the Memorial, despite the talk show jabber about people disappearing near the Memorial and the funhouse mirrors.  Most citizens viewed the talk shows as irresponsible tabloids and didn't believe a word of it.  They put those listening in the same category as those believing that a crop of black helicopters were taking over the U.S.
<p>
Just then what looked like a large bird came flapping from the distance.  Johnathon was still leaning heavily on Regina, who was suffering from a bit of fader-lag. As the bird approached, it was Johnathon who first noticed the evil-looking black helicopter.  The sides of the copter were covered with convex ramekins and the spokes of the propellers appeared ramous.
The noise was so loud as to defoilate small trees and suck everything towards it.
<p>
"Let's get to the monument," Regina yelled to his ear, "I was told to get us as the monument in Lebanon, and then what we have done will be finished."  Johanthon just looked at her oddly, wondering what that comment meant.  The pages of a novel, or perhaps a dictionary, lay swirling at his feet, until ascending towards the strange aircraft.  The noise was deafening and his life passed before his eyes like the favorite strophe of a childhood poem:
"the long midsummer ripening...in this, his own country."
