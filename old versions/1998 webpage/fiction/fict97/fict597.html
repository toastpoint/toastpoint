<h3><a href=mailto:GWTW98@aol.com>Scarlett</a> begins a <a name="tira">Romance</a> novel 05/16/97</h3>
Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.   Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.  But his discontent lasted but a second.  He stared in disbelief at the clerk who now smiled, flashing all 300 of his gleeming blue alien teeth.  <p>
"Pongo!" the emperor cried out, almost falling from his throne.  Pongo approached the throne and bowed slightly. <p>
"The years have been kind to you Emperor," he said slyly. <p>
Emperor Zog stood up and extended his huge arms out to Pongo and squeezed him.
"Tell me where she is Pongo or this time I will finish you off!" <p>
Pongo chuckled lightly and then flashed another one of his debonair smiles.
"Alright old friend, you got me. She's in you palace bedroom, asleep.  She was quite tired after the hyperspeed ride from Planet Arate and at the thought of seeing you was just plain tuckered out." <p>
Zog dropped Pongo to the floor and ran, stumbling a bit, of the room.  Pongo just laid there on the floor laughing as Zog's footsteps got further and further away. <p>
The Emperor threw open the heavy titanium door to his bedroom and found her laying upon his triangle shaped bed.  He ran to her and sat beside her on the bed.
"Tira," he whispered softly into her ear. She stirred a bit and then opened her eyes. <p>
"Oh Zog!"  she said, throwing arms upon him.  He held her so close, closer than he had ever held her before. <p>
"Tira," he said, stroking her face with his hand,"Let us never be parted again." <p>
She smiled mysteriously and drew him close again without a word.

<h3><a href=mailto:svyazov@atlas.chem.utah.edu>Pollie</a> begins a  fiction novel 05/06/97</h3>
Leila sat on the couch beside the window.  It was a disgusting,
blustery and rather rainy day. Beside Leila sat her, black, fat cat  
Fifi. He had green sparkling eyes which stared upon
Leila's face.  No other soul exept Leila and Fifi was in the house,
and since she was not fond of books and there was no television
in there, she just stared out the window, which was rather dull.
Suddenly her eyes met the eyes of a man putting a letter on the front
porch of her house.  As soon as the letter was on the porch he ran
away in a hurry.  Leila decided that she must see the letter, so
she put on her new, huge and red rubber boots.
<p>
As she opened the door
that was leading to the front porch, she picked up the letter.  After
tearing it open she read this "BY THIS TIME YOU PROBABLY REALIZE THAT 
THE DOOR TO YOUR HOUSE IS SHUT AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KEY, SO YOU 
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO MEET ME UNDER THE BIG OAK TREE IN THE FOREST
I WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING." As Leila looked at the door it was shut 
thousands of questions started going through her mind.
The one she worried about most was  WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?...

<h3><a href=mailto:hotmail.com>Ingrid Sweet</a> begins a Horror novel 05/03/97</h3>
Although grandly appelled Fortescue Manor by its original owners, the 
townspeople still referred to the aging structure as Jezebel's Den, 
although the tragic events therein had reached their conclusion decades earlier.
But the manor had acquired a new tenant.  She was a young woman who just wanted to get away from the city's hustle and bustle of everyday life.  She needed a place to rest and regroup her thoughts.  She hadn't meant to hurt Walter, but he had pushed her once too often.  She hoped that no one found the body until she
had put enough distance between her and her previous life.
<p>
This place had been advertised in the city paper as a summer rental.  She had
used one of her many aliases when applying for the rental.  Here, she could
change her identity and quietly fade into obscurity.  She was a little curious
why the place was being rented so cheaply.  But she had decided that getting
away from the city was more important then worrying about something to good
to be true.
<p>
Well this little miss was in for a surprise.  The manor was haunted and the 
resident spirit was looking for a new host to carry on it's macabre history.  
When the young lady arrived at the manor, a pair of disembodied eyes watched
her from an upstairs window.  It could smell her sin, and feel her fear.  Its
appetite whetted, he floated down to greet its new hostess.  Boy, was it going
to have fun with this visitor.

 Gannon stood at the threshhold of an enormous cliff, his toes peering over the edge.  He was awash with the golden light of the low western sun.  Though the burning globe appeared massive against the sprawling countryside below, a huge form loomed in front of it, appearing as if it were trying to snuff out its light.  It was a citadel, more closely resembling the groping hand of a demon than a physical structure built by his immortal enemy.  Though the golden light was penetrating, the darkness emanating from the stronghold far outmatched it.  They knew that he was here, standing in the presence of their dark sanctuary.  Even now they were coming for him, the silhouettes of twisted creatures black against the failing light.  Winged beasts, ready to seize their last enemy.
<p>
His mouth twisted in a faint smile which scarcely creased the fine features of his Elven face.  A breeze softly touched his long, white hair and sent the small trinkets and pouches at his tunic swaying just a little.  He stepped back from the cliff.  The creatures were closing, faster now.  His smile broadened.
<p>
"Fools," he whispered, his hand tightening around his sword in response.
<p>
Even now he could hear their screeching...

<h3><a href=mailto:wyatt@inconnect.com>Ashley</a> begins a Fantasy novel 05/01/97</h3>
The Queen of the Time, Borjade Vila, took exquisite pride in herself.  She adorned her head with the purest gold and a clear droplet of crystal fell just above her eyes.  She had her tailors fashion her gowns with only the most expensive fabrics imported from Greece and India.  This was not to say, however, that she was only interested in herself.  She did, in fact, attend an annual benefit for the poor and organize other sundry entertainment events for her people.  The more she entertained them, the more they loved her.  She offered them the freedom to choose their own leader, but because they knew of her great generosity and integrity, the people unanimously chose Borjade to be their Eternal Queen.  Well, perhaps not quite unanimously was the Queen chosen...

<h3><a href=mailto:wyatt@inconnect.com>Wyatt</a> begins a  novel 05/01/97</h3>
	He often used to wake suddenly in the morning hours, long before the sun had given color to the eastern horizon.  There was an old rocker in the window alcove of his room.  It's varnish was peeling, it was missing a few slats in the backrest, and it creaked softly when he rocked it, but he found it comfortable and wouldn't replace it.  He would light a candle and sit and smoke, bundled in his robe, the window cracked just enough to admit the fresh night air which smelled so often of rain.  He never really knew why he woke or what, perhaps, might have woken him, but soon came to enjoy the time spent in the deep and misty thought that accompanied the occasion, and therefore soon ceased to fight the restlessness when it drew him from sleep.
<p>Beyond the window in the darkness lay fields strewed with the trampled husks and stalks of corn left behind by the machinery that noisily cleared them in early autumn.  Still beyond those near the highway stood a small and time-worn church with its accompanying cemetery.  Both patiently endured the last few years of waning use, having fallen in favor to newer and more adequate facilities further into town.  In the pre-dawn darkness, he could sometimes detect their faint outline by the light of the autumn moon, or as dawn coaxed the world beyond the windowpane slowly into sight.  He wondered often what it might be like to spend eternity in such a place as that.  He found it simultaneously comforting and disturbing to imagine it.  It provided him with a feeling of security in and of itself, now in the shelter of leafless, overarching boughs and the nighttime shadow of the quietly deteriorating church, but beyond that into the surrounding fields, uncomfortably open and exposed, where the coyotes competed on moonlit nights with the howling of wind past the rotting cornices of neighborless houses and through the missing slats of swaying fences.
