<h2>Wumpus and Toast Point Do the San Francisco Shuffle</h2>

I was slated to give a week of software training for one of our clients in Novato, CA, which is 
north of San Francisco.  Knowing that a trip to San Francisco is like a trip to Mecca for one 
such as I, my bosses were considerate enough to schedule this trip for Memorial Day week, 
thus giving me a long weekend before and a weekend after for exploration.  
<p>
Even better, my Wumpus had the vacation time and the frequent-flyer miles to come along 
with me and play!  The Wumpus had actually been to San Francisco two years before and had 
done the city to death, but before he could start whining, I told him we'd be north of the city 
and he could visit all the beautiful places he hadn't gotten to before, and that even visiting 
familiar haunts with me along should be a thrill for him.  He grumped a bit, but came anyway. 
I had only been to SF once before, for a <A
HREF="http://agora.rdrop.com/~joe/lgba.html">Lesbian and Gay Bands
of America</A> concert and while that trip was lovely, I didn't 
have a lot of time for sight-seeing and never got out of the city, so I was willing to go 
anywhere and see anything.  Since he was going on a frequent-flyer ticket, we unfortunately 
had to return on separate flights a day apart, but were able to fly out together and even sit 
together.
<hr>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
The flight wasn't until 3:30, so we spent the morning packing.  A car service brought us to the 
airport at company expense (yay!) and the Wumpus frantically stoked up for the smokeless 
five-and-a-half-hour flight.  I was worried about him slowly getting antsier and even perhaps 
losing it completely on the flight, but he had bought some Nicorette for the occasion, and that 
took care of the problem just fine.  We had a lovely flight, which included the movie "Fierce 
Creatures", although I kept the poor stewardess scurrying back and forth to find me a headset 
that (a) worked (b) for both ears and (c) had ear pads.  It was still crackly, but I put up with it, 
as the stewardess was starting to snarl.  Wump and I played several hands of 500 rummy and 
he won, as usual.
<p>
Landed about six-ish (nine-ish to us), picked up our dark-purple rental Corsica, and drove to 
the hotel.  Since the airport is south of SF, and the hotel is north, we went straight through the 
city and even over the Golden Gate Bridge! (several times that week, actually).  The first trip 
it was clear, but we had many opportunities to observe the odd San Francisco weather, where 
the GG Bridge is shrouded in fog while everything around it is clear as day.
<p>
Spotted: rainbows painted over the mouths of the highway 101 tunnels on the SF side.  Not on 
the other side, strangely enough.
<p>
California is very hilly, which makes it looks like you're in Bag End or something.  Also, all 
the grass was brown.  "Honey, all the grass is dead!"  "No, it's not, it's just brown."  Very 
odd-looking.
<p>
The hotel is in San Rafael.  (It is pronounced "San Rafel", which led to typos and 
pronunciation confusion.)  We didn't know which exit, but by luck and only one wrong turn 
and asking at a gas station, we found it.  The desk clerk, handing us our two keys, suddenly 
began to switch us to a room with two double beds, not one, until I told him that what we 
were reserved for was fine, hee hee.  Hotel was nice - we had a hairdryer and a coffeepot in 
our room, and the bed was king-size.
<p>
We unpacked a bit, then went and had dinner in the hotel restaurant (although to us, it felt like 
11:00 p.m. or midnight by this point).  Wumpus had a full rack of ribs, I had shrimp 
quesadillas and caesar salad, both of which were light and fine.  And then to bed.

<h3>Sunday</h3>

We of course woke up <em>bright</em> and early, being three hours ahead of our 
surroundings.  I made coffee for my Wumpus, then of course realized they had only supplied 
Cremora.  I threw on some clothes and went down to the kitchen, where I quickly persuaded a 
hotel employee to obtain me a glass of milk.  Back upstairs, showered, etc.  Drove into the 
city dressed for any temperatures between 50 and 85 (and a good thing, as we got the whole 
range).  Weather was clear and gorgeous.  First went to a park in the middle of the city on 
which are located seven rowhouses known as the "Seven Sisters".  Barely avoided getting 
trampled by a busload of German tourists armed with photographic devices.  Walked around 
the park.  
<p>
Drove down to the municipal pier, right by Fisherman's Wharf. The municipal pier is a giant 
crescent-shaped thing enclosing a circle of water containing a three-masted schooner, a 
maritime museum and foolhardy swimmers.  I took a picture of <a href=wumpus-alcatraz.jpg>Wumpus with Alcatraz right behind him</a>, and then some nice lady asked if we wanted a picture of <a href=wumpnme.jpg>both of us together</a> Walked around the pier, <a href=wumpus-pier.jpg>took a picture from the end</a>, and walking back, saw the cutest little 
Asian toddler chasing a seagull from piling to piling.
<p>
Over to Fisherman's Wharf, described in the Berkeley Guides as "a tourist attraction because 
it's a tourist attraction".  Lots of shopping, tacky stores, tacky tourists, and seafood - and the 
sea lions, too.  We had breakfast at a coffee bar and then did the whole length of the wharf.  
The sea lions were quite entertaining.  Walked back, did the shops (there was a great one that 
sold very expensive musical instruments from around the world, and a Ghirardelli's chocolate 
shop, at which we bought chocolate cable cars for our various offices).  Had lunch at a 
wharfside restaurant called Boudin's (sp?, pronounced Bodeen's) that Wumpus had been 
describing excitedly to me from the last trip - they serve clam chowder in a hollowed-out 
sourdough loaf.  (Apparently, sourdough is a San Francisco thing - I was not aware of that.)  
Not being a fan of clam chowder, I tried it anyway and it was fine.
<p>
Back to the car (parked in a four-hour-free zone - little did we realize how lucky we were).  
Drove around the Embarcadero (along the bay coast), and crossed the city on Market Street, 
up to the Castro.  The Castro is of course the gay neighborhood, but it's really only a couple 
blocks of shops.  But we did have a good time.  A bubble machine outside one of the shops 
was sending bubbles wafting down the Castro, adding to the festive air.
<p>
Spotted, less than a month after the "Ellen" episode airing: t-shirts reading "Yep, I'm gay - 
now where's my toaster oven?"
<p>
In the Castro, ran into Doug Litwin, San Francisco Winds of Freedom clarinetist and former 
president of the <A
HREF="http://agora.rdrop.com/~joe/lgba.html">Lesbian and Gay Bands
of America</A>.  Nice to see him, and he was surprised to 
see me, so there.  Had a nice chat about the recent SF LGBA conference, which I had missed.
<p>
Wump and I walked around trying to find the International Male store, but could not.  Had 
drinks at the Metro, but could not sit outside because all the stools were taken, hrmmph.  
Bought a paper and decided to go to see "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (the movie), which 
happened to be playing at the Embarcadero.  So we retraced our steps back there.
<p>
The movie was, in fact, quite good and, we thought, better than the play, which we had seen 
largely with the same cast on stage two years ago.  Post-movie, we decided to go to the 
Stinking Rose, a restaurant celebrating everything that is garlic, for dinner, but by this point 
the streets had filled up with tourists, there was a huge line waiting to get into the restaurant 
(as we drove by) and we couldn't find a parking space anywhere.  So we decided to drive back 
north towards our hotel and go to Mill Valley, a small little section of Marin County which 
apparently had nice restaurants.
<p>
By this point we were quite tired and didn't appreciate the beauty of Mill Valley, but 
appreciated being able to get into La Ginestra, an Italian restaurant, with no wait (unlike the 
other restaurant we tried).  Had a perfectly OK meal which was probably our 
<em>worst</em> dinner of the trip (meaning all the others were really really really good).  
I had veal, I forget what the Wump had.  I asked for tiramisu for dessert, and the waiter, a 
cute little boy-thing, pranced over and said to me conspiratorially, "We've only got a little 
piece left, but I'll give it to you on the house!".  Which he did.  Such a nice boy.  Back to 
hotel and crashed.
