<h2>Part Five</h2>

<h3>Saturday</h3>
Saturday, we had to get up horribly early (4:00 a.m., but at least we had a head-start on getting back into the Eastern Standard Time grove) to get Mr. Wump to the airport for his 7:00 a.m. plane.  We got him all packed and out the door, and across the street to the mini-mall, where, frighteningly, the Starbucks opens at 5:30 a.m. (even on a Saturday).  There was, of course, no traffic, so we made great time to the airport (good practice for me for the next day).  I was all set to park and see him off properly, but he said, "Nah, just drop me off".  The SF Airport has a "smoker's cage" in the departure lounge, so I knew where he would be spending the next hour.
<p>
Got back to the hotel circa 8 a.m.  Esther and I were planning a day of frolics, but we knew not where and when, so I went downstairs and worked the breakfast bar.  And also realized, although I've traveled alone a hundred times before, it's no fun when you don't have your Wumpus with you.
<p>
Called Esther, found out we were going to the beach, but we had to wait for certain other parties to get up, so I went for a walk around the area and went to the musical instrument store in the mini-mall.  No bargains, but some interesting sheet music.  Back to the hotel, and another phone call with Esther.  I was to meet her and her father Don at Stinson Beach.
<p>
Stinson Beach is on the coast (duh) of the Pacific Ocean, and to get there, you drive on a really frightening mountain road - the sort where every turn brings you another fabulous view, but one wrong turn and you're off the road and down a two-mile deep gully.  But the microsecond views <em>were</em> gorgeous.  Made it down there and Esther and her dad followed not long after.  <p>
Her dad just parked at a picnic table and read, and Esther and I went and played in the surf.  The water was slightly cold, but not too bad, and the surf was great!  There were honest-to-god surfers out there, although they were wearing wetsuits (the wimps).  Esther built <a href=esther-sandcastle.jpg>a lovely sand castle</a>, and then we went walking around the rocks and <a href=esther-on-the-rocks.jpg>I took a picture of her</a>  and <a href=eric-on-the-rocks.jpg>she took a picture of me</a>!

<p>
Having our fill of the beach, Esther and I went in search of something to eat.  I was delighted with the offerings of the snack bar, but Esther went into a frenzy of indecision and we ended up going across the street and getting her a blueberry muffin and some weird Mexican peanut paste thing.
<p>
<block><b>Spotted</b>: an ad posted on a bulletin board, reading "Girl/Sister/Female/Woman-child seeking sublet or housesitting opportunity.  Perhaps land where I can pitch my own tipi?</b></block>
<p>
Esther and I headed back to the picnic area, where we read her high school literary mag and discussed science fiction with her dad.  Finally, we bid a sad adieu, as she had to go home and primp for that night's Senior Ball.
<p>
Sad, friendless and Wumpus-less, I decided to go back to the hotel, get changed and go see a movie.  Quite amazed to find out, once I perused the movie listings, there was an entire mall two blocks from the hotel which we had not seen the entire week simply because we'd never been in that direction.  So I got all clean and changed and went over to the mall.  Did the mall thing.  Bought a graduation gift for Esther, so I could bring it east with me 3,000 miles, buy a card to go with it, and ship it all the way back.
<p>
Went to see "Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery".  Choice of movie determined by "what will Wumpus not be interested in seeing in the movie theater (almost everything), or eventually renting (not too much)".  Despite a large number of tacky jokes that went on way too long, it was very much fun and had some great concepts and moments.
<p>
I had pondered throwing all sanity (and my digestion) to the winds and eating at Taco Bell (because I <em>never</em> get to at home), but decided to go back to the hotel for my last guilt-free restaurant meal.  After getting up early and spending a lot of the day in the sun, I was done in and couldn't even drag my butt out looking for a restaurant, so I had shrimp diavolo at the hotel, which wasn't bad.  Was going to get a little split of champagne to have up in my room while I packed, but the bar didn't sell them.  Damn.  Went upstairs, packed, read my book, was in bed asleep by 8:45.

<h3>Saturday</h3>
Luckily, my plane was at 9:00, not at 7:00, but unlike the day before, I had to check out of the hotel and return the rental car.  They had slipped a "pre-bill" under my door which I checked out when I got up, and it was <em>wrong</em>!  Or at least odd.  So on my way out, I went over the bill and got some things corrected and got it all squared away.
<p>
One final bagel and coffee from the local donut shoppe (no Starbucks for me!) and farewell to San Ra-fell.  Down the highway to the city, where I realized I was about a half hour ahead of schedule and maybe I'd have time to check out the wave organ that Esther had told me about it.  It was supposedly by the marina in a little park.  Well, I found a little park by the marina, but because of the way the streets were laid out, it took me forever to actually get there and park, and it turned out it was the wrong park anyway, and by that time, it was too late to go to the other end of the marina.  Ended up having to drive across the city hitting all lights, into the sun.  Sigh.
<p>
Dropping off the car at the airport was absurdly easy, and I ended up with quite a wait at the airport for the flight, 'cause I was so early.  Flight back was uneventful, except that they charged money to rent those stupid headphones (they were free on the way out, as I pointed out to the stewardess).  The movie was "Beautician and the Beast", a perfect "trapped on an airplane" movie - and then when I got home, Wumpus said that they had NOT shown that movie on <em>his</em> flight - and he's the one who had wanted to see it more than I.  Sigh again.
<p>
And that was it!  It was a fabulous trip!  Ta-da!  
<p>
Oh, a postscript - Marianne and Gaylord had a baby boy, Campbell Hannegan Holder, on June 30th!
