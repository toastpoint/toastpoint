<h2>Part Three</h2>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
Wednesday was another workday for me, but one filled with anticipation, as the night would be spent meeting <a href= http://www.best.com/~donh/esther/>Esther</a>, my internet friend of several years now, who I had never actually met in "meatspace".  We had been conversing on the phone the past few evenings and we were meeting her in Berkeley.  Wumpus spent the day exploring Oakland, which turns out to be a really depressed sad town with a large population of really poor people and a small population of really rich people.
<p>
Esther told us to meet her by the Berkeley BART station, and described to us how to get there, and with only a couple of wrong turns, we actually got there very early.  Parked the car and walked around the college campus.  Very exciting for me, as the '60s is a fascinating historical period for me and Berkeley was a hotbed of revolution and was featured in a documentary, (called, get this, "Berkeley in the '60s") which I thought I had on tape, but cannot find now that I am home.  Pretty campus in some parts, and sort of seedy in others.  One sad folk guitarist, who looked like he easily could have been there 30 years before, and just stayed, was displaying more vitality than talent as he loudly sang something perched on the fountain.
<p>
Back to the BART station, where we met Ms. Esther.  In her inimitable bounciness, she led us through block after bohemian block of Berkeley.  For a college town, Berkeley is surprisingly run-down, as if no one has repaired the sidewalk in years.  Not happy vibes.  I thought it would be cleaner and neater, somehow.  But there were lots of new-agey bookstores, sidewalk vendors, and children of the 60s who haven't moved on and I would have loved to have more time to fully explore.  Ran into a friend of Esther's, a lovely Asian girl who sadly had bizarrely dyed hair and multiple piercings, including tongue (eek!).  
<p>

The meal was indeed eaten without utensils, but it's not just dipping your fingers in stew, you pick everything up with pieces of their special bread.  It was really fun.  I presented Esther with a big cylindrical can of Ghirardelli chocolate non-pareils, which I had purchased for myself in a fit of weakness, and then realized could do me no good.  (Esther's young and thin and a package of chocolates will have no lasting effect.)
<p>
We then went to an ice-cream store to clear our palate, but it was closed, so we went to a frozen-yogurt store instead.  Ms. Esther had a huge concoction involving gummie bears, and Wump and I had Mocha Madness, but it was fat-free and sugar-free and tasted not unlike frozen spackling, so I didn't finish mine.  (Sorry, Esther, not your fault.)  Saw her back to the BART station, bid her farewell until Saturday, and drove back to the hotel.

<h3>Thursday</h3>
Another work day for me.  The Wump went into San Francisco and walked around and went shopping, then back to the hotel for a swim.  We had decided not to do anything special for Thursday night besides dinner, but we wanted to try a restaurant recommended by a different boss, called the Buckeye Rodeo.  We called for a reservation, and they had no seatings available till 9:30 p.m.!  So we debated, then decided to try to get a reservation for the next night, and called back, and they didn't have anything open except for 5:30 and 9:30, sigh.  So we gave up on them and went down to the hotel front desk and asked for a recommendation.  They steered us to a place called Marin Joe's  (by pressing a little button and directions on how to get there from the hotel printed out on a little slip of paper - very impressive).  I drove, Wumpus navigated.  I got mad at him for reading too far ahead in the instructions, then it turned out that it got so complicated I needed to know all the steps at once, and I apologized.
<p>
The restaurant was a hoot.  It was very noisy, fun, and had everyone from families with kids have birthdays up at the counter, to businessmen and trucker types, all enjoying themselves.  Since we had set ourselves in the mood for steak, we ended up ordering the Porterhouse for two, which turned out to be an amazing slab o' cow.  Not bad, but imposing in quantity.  The marinated mushrooms and the vegetables and french fries and stuff that came with it were wonderful, and we got mildly drunk and had a very enjoyable, stuffed time.
