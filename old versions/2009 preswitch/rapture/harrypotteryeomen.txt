An excerpt from "Harry Potter and the Yeomen of the Guard" (Sharon Brindle)

WIZARDS:
Harry Potter! Harry Potter!
Grappled Voldemort, the rotter,
Gaining power by the hour,
Making every wizard cower!
Every wizard cowered low!

DUMBLEDORE:
Dids't thou not, oh Harry Potter,
When no more than babe in arms
Face a deadly wizard's slaughter
And survive through magic charms?

WIZARDS:
Harry Potter faced his slaughter
But survived through magic charms!

DUMBLEDORE:
Dids't thou not when danger heightened,
And the Stone was under threat,
Rescued it, though very frightened,
Putting Hogwarts in your debt!

WIZARDS:
Harry Potter, what a lot o'
Wizards now are in your debt!

HARRY:
Truly it was very humbling
Facing such a deadly foe
But I set his spirits crumbling
Voldemort was soon brought low

Oh, the tales that are narrated
Of my deeds of derring do
Have been much exaggerated
Very much exaggerated
Though I must say all are true
Every word of them is true!

WIZARDS:
They are not exaggerated, etc.

RON:
Harry!

HARRY:
I beg your pardon!

RON:
Don't you know me?
I'm little Weasley!

HARRY:
Weasley? Is this Weasley?
What! Little Weasley?

(aside to Dumbledore):
Should I know him eas'ly?

etc, etc.
