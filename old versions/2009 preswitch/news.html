Welcome to <A href="http://www.toastpoint.com/bio.html">Eric Peterson</A>'s <I>Toast Point Page</I>, where we celebrate all that is scintillating and tweaks one in interesting places! 


<H2><A name=news></A>News</H2>
<STRONG>Dec. 16, 2008</STRONG> - We come to the end of a weird and not great fall.  Nothing much to report, see my blog. 
<hr>
<STRONG>Oct 18, 2008</STRONG> - A quiet September has led into a fairly hopping October.  I went to St. Paul for a week for business, but the Wumpus came along to sightsee - we'd never done that before, and it made for an unusually fun business trip.  Since then I've been playing the occasional <i>Into the Woods</i> rehearsal, getting ready for the chamber music workshop, starting Blue Hill Troupe concert rehearsals (every other Tuesday) and playing horn in band (every Monday).  Holidays coming up, too, egad.
<p>Still no word on the Savoynet job, although I suspect they are making that decision <i>right now</i>.
<p>Also very much caught up in the election.  I've also fallen in love with Rachel Maddow.

<hr>

<p>
<STRONG>September 7, 2008</STRONG> - Wow, that was quick.  The Oslo wedding <i>did</i> happen, and I did go - see the Photo Gallery.  The Wumpus couldn't get away from work, so instead of going to Amsterdam, I went to London for a few days, walking around the city and getting together with G&S and internet friends.  It was a <i>great</i> trip, I had a blast.  

I didn't audition for Mikado because of that trip, but my big concern right now, besides practicing the VERY DIFFICULT <i>Into the Woods</i> score, is getting ready to run a chamber music workshop for the LGBA band conference that the Big Apple Corps is hosting over Halloween weekend.  I'm very excited - I miss doing that sort of thing.

Had a business trip to Boston at the end of August, will be going to St. Paul the end of September.  The Wumpus might come along, that would be awesome.  He's never seen the Twin Cities.
<hr>
<p>
<STRONG>August 6, 2008</STRONG> - Much up in the air right now.  I auditioned for, but did not get cast in "Into the Woods".  However, they are tapping me to play piano for some rehearsals, and I'm going to enjoy getting my fingers into that score.  I might audition for a "Mikado" coming up (VLOG).  Also, best friend may be getting married to his Norwegian partner in Oslo over Labor Day weekend (or if not then, within the next couple of months). We're eyeing the possibility of making a trip to Oslo and Amsterdam to take part and to sightsee.

I'm also throwing my hat into the ring (finally) to conduct next year's Savoynet show.  Cross your fingers!
<hr>
<p>
<STRONG>July 4, 2008</STRONG> - Let's see.  I went to Orlando to sing Gilbert & Sullivan.  It was very warm, but I did get to go to <a href=http://stanharding.livejournal.com/295798.html>Islands of Adventure</a> and ride rollercoasters.  Then BHT did "Thespis" - it went very well and was very well received.  Next up - "Into the Woods" auditions.
<hr>
<p>
<STRONG>June 1, 2008</STRONG> - I have been cast as "Preposteros" in the Blue Hill Troupe's concert of 
Thomas Z. Shepard's version of <a href=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/118149.html>Thespis</a>.  That will be a lot of fun.  I'm also going to Orlando for another G&S sing, doing a lot of roles this time.  Work is very busy for both of us, but things are going along very nicely.  I'll have a full page of trip reports and pictures from the Italy trip up within the month.

<hr>

<STRONG>April (end of), 2008</STRONG> - <i>We went to Italy again</i>, woohoo, with several days in Milan and a two-week tour of Sicily.  You can see a quick rundown of the trip highlights and lowlights <a href=http://stanharding.livejournal.com/276688.html>here</a>, and I'll be following that up with many many reports and pictures.  I forget what happened to the rest of March, it's all a blur.  There was a business trip in there, and gathering props for a production of <i>Follies</i>.  And I didn't get the BHT fall show (sux), but have some other possibilities in the works.

<hr>
<STRONG>March, 2008</STRONG> - In limbo, performing-wise.  Not going to Buxton this year.  Have not heard about the BHT fall show yet.  On the other hand, getting some life-stuff done and working on the Italian.  This trip is going to be a lot of fun.
<hr>
<STRONG>February, 2008</STRONG> - January was busy, but not in an exciting way.  We were both hammered at work - still are, actually.  The Wumpus has been planning our trip to Italy and I've started taking Italian lessons on Rosetta Stone.  It's fun, and if anyone in Italy asks me what color that bicycle is, I'll be all set.<p>
I have no performing projects going on now at all (sob) because of the trip, but me and a bunch of buddies put together our videotaped auditions for Savoynet's <i>Princess Ida</i> this summer and got those sent off.  We should find out the casting news this month.
<p>Oh, and we celebrated our 13th anniversary on Jan 15.  Lucky 13!
<hr>
<STRONG>January, 2008</STRONG> - Happy New Year!  December was about the holidays, of course.  Mom and Dad were in town for a week, Sam and her lady friend for a few days.  We had a great time and the Wumpus's cooking was extraordinary, even more than usual.
<hr>
<STRONG>December, 2007</STRONG> - Oh my.  OK, so we went to Mom and Dad's in South Carolina for Thanksgiving week.  It was <i>so</i> relaxing.  Lots of food, lots of shopping, lots of Scrabble.  Then the band concert was Dec 1 (see the Dec 2007 header picture) and was very much fun.  Then it was off to St. Paul for a business trip, with high temperatures in the teens and lots of SNOW.  The rest of the month is about holiday prep, of course - a family gathering for his half, then my half shows up for a week over Xmas.  Eek!

<hr>
<STRONG>November, 2007</STRONG> - <i>Mame</i> is over.  It was <i>excellent</i>.  Possibly the best theatrical experience I've had in a long time.  Mr. Man and I are going to my parents' house in South Carolina for a much-deserved rest Thanksgiving week.  Then I'm playing bassoon (!) in the <a href=http://www.lgbac.org>BAC</a> concert on Dec. 1.
<hr>
<STRONG>October, 2007</STRONG> - Hip-deep in <a href=http://www.bht.org/mame.php3>Mame</a> right now.  The first two weeks of September rehearsals was learning music, which the cast did VERY well.  Now it's about staging and finding an orchestra - luckily my <a href=http://www.lgbac.org>BAC</a> buddies are happy to help.  Work's been busy as well for both of us.  I had a birthday, got an iPod, that was cool.  The Wumpus has his this month.
<p>
	We're talking about going to Milan and Sicily in February - stay tuned!
<hr>

<STRONG>September, 2007</STRONG> - Hmmm, what was August like?  The England trip was wonderful and easy.  Since then, it's been Mame Mame Mame as far as my brain is concerned.  Workwise, I've got several projects on the burner, and was back in Boston for my sixth trip this year.  
<p>
This month Mame rehearsals actually <I>start</i> - hurrah.  Mom and Dad will be in town - they're taking a cruise up to Canada and will be in town before and after that.  And it's my birthday near the end of the month - the Wumpus has already sheepishly reported that he's overspent on my birthday list.  Sweet!
<hr>
<STRONG>August, 2007</STRONG> - The end of last month was all about Harry Potter, of course.  Now that it's over with,  I can get my life back.  I'll be spending this first full week in England, at the G&S festival - that should be a lot of fun.  I'm leaving the Wumpus on his own, just like last year, but his personal situation is SO much better than it was then - he'll be just fine.
<hr>
<STRONG>July, 2007</STRONG> - Summer is proceeding very nicely.  I'm rehearsing sort of casually with the Mame principals, work has been very quiet and I'm getting a lot of home projects accomplished.  Such as buying this new computer that I'm working on now.  Unfortunately, I'm have a hell of a time doing simple HTML edits - must address that at some point.  <p>Mr. Man's job continues to be wonderful, but also stressful and he's trying to surmount some personality issues there.  <p>I'm also practicing "Pinafore" like mad and also putting together the Savoynet cabaret.
	<hr><P><STRONG>June, 2007</STRONG> - All is in very good shape here.  The Wumpus still loves his new job, and they love him.  (He's very busy, though.)  My job is also very busy and very interesting.  I'll be in St. Paul for a week this month.  Also heading to Rochester for a few days to attend the high school graduation of a friend's son.  Yes, it's true, my friends' babies are now becoming adults, eek.
<p>Mame is cast, and the cast is excellent.  I can't wait to start working with them all.  Also, because Mr. Man can't take vacation for a while, I decided to go BACK TO BUXTON to play rehearsal piano for the Savoynet <i>HMS Pinafore</i>.  Only for a week, but it will be a lot of fun.	<hr>
<P><STRONG>May, 2007</STRONG> - The biggest and best news is that the Wumpus got a new job!  He'll be doing database support and training for an organization that Does Good.  After what was pretty much a hellish job search, this is a fabulous outcome.  It's a real job, too, with benefits!  And vacation, lots of it!
	<p>
		As for me, I'm typing this from a hotel in Boston, where I've been travelling a lot on business.  That's been fun.  Yeomen was terrific - and I'm glad it's over.  I sang my first Ko-Ko and Paramount at a Troupers Light Opera event this past weekend, I'm singing The Foreman of the Jury in a semi-pro <i>Trial by Jury</i> on Thursday, and then Mame auditions are coming up.  Busy busy.
	<hr>
<P><STRONG>April, 2007</STRONG> - And all is abuzz abuzz abuzz.  <i>Yeomen</i> is in the final stretches and it's really going to be something special.  Pity I have so little to do in it.  There are also some other G&S events coming up: I'll be singing Foreman in a quickie <i>Trial by Jury</i> and (hurrah!) both Ko Ko and King Paramount at the Troupers Light Opera singout next month (plus accompanying some other stuff).
<p>
Workwise, the Wumpus is <i>this close</i> to landing a new job, and I'll update this if he gets it.  We're very excited.  My job has also suddenly become more interesting and I've started making little business trips to Boston, a city I'm enjoying getting to know.  Did you know about the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Molasses_Disaster>Boston Molasses Disaster</a>?

<hr>
<P><STRONG>March, 2007</STRONG> - February was pretty hopping, with various out-of-towners visiting, a couple of Broadway shows (<i>A Chorus Line</i> and <i>Company</i>), Valentine's Day and so on.  "Yeomen" rehearsals continue on - disheartened to discover that, as a townsman, I'm cut out of some of the best men's chorus music, sung in this production by Yeomen only.  Nevertheless, it'll be a good show.
<p>
The <i>big</i> news is that I was asked to music-direct the <i>fall</i> show, traditionally a musical.  As of this writing (March 4th), it's down to two shows, "Mame" and "Guys & Dolls".  We should know in a day or so which it is.  (I'm hoping for G&D, myself.)  Very exciting.  Whichever show it is, we'll probably have auditions in May, then start rehearsals bigtime in September for a late Oct/early November run.
<p>(3/11) The show is "Mame".  I've gotten the score and script and am hard at work already.  Fun stuff!
<hr>
<P><STRONG>February, 2007</STRONG> - Well, the last month was about various sinus problems for both of us, which continue in mild form.  After the scarily-warm December and early January, it's now very very very cold here.  I wish we'd get some real snow, though.
<p>
The Wumpus continues in his increasingly-more-frustrating contract job, and I have my fingers in more and more pies at work.  I do have the possibility of moving offices to midtown - that would be great if it happens - less noise (I hope) and a shorter commute.
<p>
Also in rehearsal for Blue Hill's "Yeomen".  I'm the minister, which means I'll be presiding over both the execution and the wedding - what fun!  Also, doing the Blue Hill concerts - three presentations of G&S highlights - two at fancy private clubs in NYC, and one at the Met!  The Met museum, that is.  
<p>
And I'm enjoying working out at the gym.  Have had two sessions with a trainer.  Slight weight loss.  Go, me!
<hr>

<P><STRONG>January, 2007</STRONG> - We had a very nice holiday, hosted my parents for a week and threw a great Xmas day dinner party.  Now it's about getting in shape - physically and otherwise - for the new year.  I'm starting rehearsals for "Yeomen" and the Blue Hill Troupe concerts now, and I've joined the gym in my building.  
<hr>
<P><STRONG>December, 2006</STRONG> - Lots going on.  <i>ALNM</i>'s went beautifully, and I still miss the company, we had a great time.  The Wumpus and I went to Rochester for Thanksgiving, a nice little getaway.  I auditioned for a principal role in <a href=http://www.bht.org>Blue Hill Troupe</a>'s <i>The Yeomen of the Guard</i>, but did not get one - however, I will be doing chorus, so look for that in April.  Now it's all about preparations for Christmas.
<hr>
<P><STRONG>November, 2006</STRONG> - <i>A Little Night Music</i> <b>continues</b> to go splendidly!  At this writing, we're in tech, then dress rehearsals and then we open.  Blue Hill rehearsals are also going along nicely.  But the best news is the Wumpus is <i>working</i>!  He has a contract job where he gets paid quite a bit for performing very very simple tasks on a computer.  It's a living.  Best of all, it's in midtown, not in effing Jersey City, so the commute is half as long as his last job.
<hr>
<P><STRONG>October, 2006</STRONG> - <i>A Little Night Music</i> is going splendidly.  A great cast, a wonderful director, and we're moving along very quickly.  Blue Hill Troupe rehearsals start up this month as well.  In other news, the Wumpus is getting job nibbles right and left - cross your fingers.  Maybe he'll be employed by the time his birthday roles around the end of the month.
	<hr>
<P><STRONG>September, 2006</STRONG> - An eventful month. 
<P>The Wumpus's mother passed away on September 14 after a serious illness. She was 83 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>I've been cast as Mr. Lindquist, the bass of the quintet, in <A href="http://members.aol.com/bartsweb/shows/lnmusic.htm">A Little Night Music</A> with <A href="http://members.aol.com/bartsweb/">St. Bart's Players</A> in Manhattan. I'm very excited about that. Performances are Nov. 9-19. 
<P>I also have been accepted into the <A href="http://www.bht.org/">Blue Hill Troupe</A>, which means I'll be performing in <I>The Yeomen of the Guard</I> in the spring. Nice to have my year all set up now! 

<hr>
<p><strong>August, 2006</strong> - I'm back from the International Gilbert & Sullivan festival!  I had a great time.  Ruddygore 
went extremely well. See the <a href=travel/buxton2006.html>Buxton 2006</a> page for pictures and links to blog entries.
<hr>
<P><STRONG>July, 2006</STRONG> - The Wumpus and I 
	<a href=http://stanharding.livejournal.com/181635.html>went to Bermuda</a>
 for a quicky long-weekend vacation!  Then it's a business trip 
	to St. Paul, and finally leaving for England at the end of the month.  
<hr>

<P><STRONG>June, 2006</STRONG> - Even with the minor tweaks I've been making, the Toast Point page has gotten more attention from me in the last month or so then in the previous eight years.  I blame the band!
<p>
Our big news is that we lost <a href=gifs/leoonbed.jpg>our beloved cat</a>, Leopold.  He was sixteen years old.  There will be a Leo tribute page up here eventually, with lots of pictures.  We miss our little fluffboy very much.

<hr>
<P><STRONG>May, 2006</STRONG> - Hmm, what happened to the beginning of the year?</P>
<P>Well, the big news is that <EM>www.toastpoint.com</EM> has moved to a different host - for the first time since it was founded in 1995.&nbsp; Remember back then, when 5 mgs of space was a big deal?&nbsp; Well, <A href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network Solutions</A> gives me 3 gig!&nbsp; So I can dump all sorts of crap up here.&nbsp; You can be frightened now.&nbsp; Anyway, you can expect a lot of changes to the Toast Point Page over the next few weeks, but all content is staying, and I hope to add new stuff - music, video, all sorts of stuff.</P>
<P>A side effect of the move is I now own the domain <I>Wumpus's real name.com</I>. We haven't done anything with it yet, but he will want to use it for self-promotion at some point as he markets himself as a consultant.&nbsp; Yes, it's true, he's losing his job of 15 years.&nbsp; His office is moving to Durham, NC, and (well) he's not.&nbsp; So, his last day is in mid-August.&nbsp; Yes, it's worth his while to stay til the end, so it's <EM>not </EM>worth it for him to start interviewing yet.</P>
<P>In other news, I'm now an official Business Analyst instead of a Documentation Specialist.&nbsp; And I'm going back to Buxton (yay!) for the <A href="http://www.gs-festival.co.uk/">G&amp;S Festival</A>: I' m in the chorus for the <A href="http://web.mac.com/robertray/iWeb/Ruddygore%20Public/Ruddygore%202006.html">Savoynet Ruddygore</A>.</P>
