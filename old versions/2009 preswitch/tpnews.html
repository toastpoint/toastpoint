<BASE target=_top>What's going on with this web page? 
<H2><A name=news></A>Updates</H2>


<p>12/16 - I think it's time to give up on The Toast Point Page.  Everything 
I need to do in terms of keeping current can be done through Facebook and my blog.  
My hope is to keep the <i>toastpoint</i> domain and the static content somewhere free.  But
it's not going anywhere yet - stay tuned.
<p>10/18 - Wow, very late.  (I've been very busy.)  No time now to do anything but throw up a fall-ish header page and update the news.
<p>9/7 - Photo Gallery has been updated with the Oslo/London pictures (yay!).  This month's picture is one of those - a shot of one of the Vigeland statues from the Frogner Park in Oslo.  I'll have to do one of the London ones next month.

<p>8/6 - I got to go to the Catskills for a couple of days last week.  This picture is a cool bench at <a href=http://www.olana.org/>Olana</a>.

<p>7/4 - Happy 4th of July!  Best new thing - the <a href=travel/italy2008.html>complete Italy trip report</a>.  This month's pic is of one of my favorite office buildings in Chicago.<p>

<p>6/1 - Oh, look, it's the first of the month!  I'll have trip reports and stuff up soon.  This 
picture is from Lake Como.
<p>4/27 - Waaaay behind, as the first few days of April were panicky preparing for our trip.  April/May's pick is of the fascinating "cappucino nipple" that was served to me in Cefalù.

<p>3/7 - Nothin' much, just updates of news and header.  This month's picture is mellophones!  (or maybe marching baritones?)  I used to play mellophone in marching band.  Get it - 'March'?


<p>2/5 - OK, a little behind, and I have some work to do.  I have some cleanups to do in <s>Aisle 5</s> the Haiku Contest which I <s>haven't gotten to yet, but soon</s> have done some of, but discovered more bad links, so...  This month's picture is the whole clarinet family, including the droolworthy contrabasses (or 'paperclips' or 'radiators').  I used to play Bb contrabass once upon a time...  I also added a Past Headers Gallery link to the TOC.  The PHG has always been there if you click this month's picture, but I wanted to make it more obvious.

<p>1/1 - Happy New Year!  OMG, I made deadline!  This month's picture is the "baldicello" in our complex's garden, all lit up for the holidays.  I don't know why it's called a "baldicello", or whether the spelling is really "bal di cielo" or whatever.  It's pretty, though.  Oh, and I finally updated my <a href=bio.html>bio</a>.
<p>12/7 - Only a week behind.  This picture is from the band concert 12/1.  Thanks, Brandon!
<p>11/15 - <i>Half a month</i> behind, oy.  I've been busy, what can I say?  This month's picture is from the "Mame" curtain call.
<p>10/8 - A week behind, as usual.  Updated news, header pic, added a <a href=http://www.bht.org/mame.php3>Mame</a> link to the index.
<p>9/11 - Updated table of contents with links to Friendster, MySpace, Facebook.
<p>9/3 - No, it's not fall yet, but I like to look forward.
<p>8/3 - Not too bad!  And I got it done before I left for England!  (hours away)  This month is Hogwarts!
<p>7/8 - Right on schedule, one week behind.  This month's pic is a YES album poster from "Yessongs".  My sister and I had that up on the wall of our bathroom when we were in high school and it was wonderful to stare at and get lost in when you were otherwise mundanely occupied.
<p>6/9 - Boy, I'm really falling behind.  Ah, well.  This month's header is St. Mark's Square in Venice, taken on our 2005 trip.  Cross your fingers, we may be going to Sicily this year.
<p>5/8 - Oops, a week late.  The picture is me in my fabulous costume from Yeomen.  Also removed the hit counter and guestbook links.  No point.
<p>4/3 - Monthly updates, nothing special.
<p>3/11 - Added some more podcasts to the <a href=links.html>Links</a> page.  Updated news, too.
<p>3/4 - This month's picture is from our 2000 trip to Ireland - this is me at the natural history museum in downtown Dublin.  Also, added <a href=http://www.bht.org/yeomen.php3>Yeomen</a> link to table of contents.
<p>2/10 - Oh, isn't that <i>spiffy</i>?  It looks like the newly-upgraded Internet Explorer is not handling the frames correctly in the menu bar to the left, even though the code is correct.  I downloaded Firefox and it works great there.  I guess I need to figure out how to Not Use Frames, as I'm well aware they are spat upon by all right-thinking web gurus.  Well, it ain't gonna happen today.
<p>2/4 - updated news and monthly header.  This month's picture is from <i>A Little Night Music</i> - I hope to have more ALNM pictures up eventually.
<p>1/5 - updated news and monthly header.
<p>12/10 - updated news and monthly header.
<p>11/4 - updated news and monthly header.  Why I didn't use my ghost picture for October, I don't know, that would have made more sense.  Ah, well.
<p>10/16 - arrrggg... corrected some major target problems with the <a href=links.html target=tpcenter>Links</a> page.
<P>10/6 -updated the News section, added new header graphic for October.  Also added the <a href=http://www.kodakgallery.com/I.jsp?c=e5mh613.b98umm5b&x=0&y=-4yk5s2
>40th birthday picture album</a> to the photos page, which for some reason I'd never added before.
<P>9/22 - updated the News section (much news to report), replaced the Ruddygore link with an A Little Night Music link.
<P>9/11 - edited the <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/ponder.html">Writing</A> page to include the Wumpus's account of <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/writing/sept11.html">our 9/11</A>. 
<P>9/4 - added a new monthly header, generated from <A href="http://www.says-it.com/">http://www.says-it.com/</A>. Updated news. Added a <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/gifs/pastheaders.html">Past Headers</A> page, which you can see by clicking on the current header, just to preserve all these lovely little headers. 
<P>8/26 - updated <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/travel/buxton2006.html">Buxton 2006</A> page with a link to the Ruddygore 2006 production page, as our director has agreed to leave it up. 
<P>8/20 - belated replaced 2nd July pic with August 'Colbert Report' pic. Created Bermuda and Buxton travel pages with links to photo albums and blog entries. You can get to both of them from the <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/photo.html">photo</A> page. 
<P>7/7 - replaced July greeting pic with a <A href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/motivator.php">motivational poster</A> created from one of our Bermuda pics. And because the picture is big enough to push the News off the bottom of the screen, reset the table of contents behavior to pop the News up to the top of the center page. Also updated Photo page with Bermuda and Austin links. 
<P>6/16 - updated the <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/wumpus.html" target=tpcenter>Wumpus</A> page. 
<P>6/2 - restored images for <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/fiction/novels/peak.html">Peak of Passion, Pinnacle of Desire</A>.

<P>5/20 - added a guestbook! 
<P>5/19 - corrected this page's tendency to launch the links in this squishy little box, plus a spacing issue in the menu. Also repointed some TOC links to load to the middle of the main page.
