<H2>Why&nbsp;<A name=toast></A>Toast Point?</H2><B><I>Toast Point</I></B> is a 
term of endearment from my <A 
href="wumpus.html">Wumpus</A>! Once upon a time, when 
the Wumpus and I were dating, we were getting all googly and disgustingly 
adorable and calling each other cute things. After I called him "my little nacho 
chip", he responded with "my little toast point". I thought that was the cutest 
thing ever, and so unique! So there you are. Toast Point is a moniker that works 
much better in print than verbally, though. (Now we call each other "sweetness" 
and "honeyman", if you're curious).
