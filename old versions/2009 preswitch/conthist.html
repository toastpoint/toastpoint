In April, 1995, inspired by my old college roommate's 
<a href=http://www.grandiose.com>HTML efforts</a>, I signed up with a web space provider and whipped 
up the Toast Point Page fairly quickly.  Was it instinct, or fate, that made me suspect 
that I had to do 
something interactive to lure people to my corner of cyberspace?  Fate, probably.  
<p>The limerick contest was fairly 
easy to set up, and I did.  Most of the first month's entries were written by me, Vance, and our 
buddies, but once it was added to Yahoo, I started getting quite a lot of 
outside traffic.  A month or so later, Vance suggested I should add a haiku contest, which turned 
out to be a simple modification of the limerick form (plus it's easier because there are no 
suggested first lines).  
Finally, the Bad Fiction Contest was truly my dream, but it took me a while to figure out 
how to structure it.  Although it got the least traffic (partially because Yahoo did not 
want to list it, although it lists the other two contests, and partially because creating 
a Bad Fiction entry is a LOT of WORK), it has produced some of the most 
hilarious results.
<p>
For four years, all three (four? as the Naughty and Squeaky-Clean 
branches of 
the Limerick Contest each have a very different, um, flavor) of the 
Toast Point contests had a steady stream of readers and entries.  
Truly, what made the contests work is the participants, their work and 
the dialog 
they inspire, and I'm delighted to have engendered these little virtual 
artist colonies!  (eek, that was awfully verbose - oh well)
<p>
In 1999, having acquired many more responsibilities, and having 
gotten to the point where maintaining the contests was a chore, not a 
pleasure, I shut down the contests indefinitely, leaving myself the 
option to start 'em up again.  At this writing, it's been almost a year 
and so far I've had no urge to go back to that well.  I think the contests 
have run their course.  I know a lot of people were disappointed, but 
I appreciated their kind comments and their participation.
