Towards small pieces

All throughout their lives<br>
People look for some meaning<br>
Yet death comes before

A slow freeze slices<br>
Night skies and icy moons with<br>
Eternal breezes.

Dreaming of winter<br>

Mists rolling through the glen<br>
Creatures sniff the morning air<br>
Buzzing insects stir
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Greetings from California... it's the cheese.. <grin>"</i>
<p>Rumbling sounds beneath<br>
Waterfall tumbling with might<br>
A soaking greeting welcomes
<p>Calling bird seeking<br>
Alight topmost branch to crown<br>
Displays his plumage
<p>Lotus flower rests<br>
Stillness on the water black<br>
Fish nuzzle tall stems

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 11/28/98</h3>
Force-ten fortitude,<br>
That's what we need. We want to<br>
Think with certitude.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The  eleven are haiku written before milking cows and are called 'Not Often Force-Ten.'"</i>
<p>
Sometimes it's a lot<br>
Less easy to be lazy,<br>
Crazy as it seems.
<p>Internal organs<br>
Play ill-mannered melodies.<br>
Be quiet, belly.
<p>Having a knowledge<br>
Of how we get knowledge is<br>
Not what teachers teach.
<p>The Mountains of Morne<br>
Sweep down to the sea in a<br>
Lilting Irish air.
<p>Bully for concrete.<br>
Poured on reeds it silences<br>
Bullfrogs in rushes.
<p>Watching water flow<br>
Down a drain is, to a child,<br>
Great entertainment.
<p>Parents of tubby<br>
Boys will stub their toes on the<br>
Fat, lazy brat's toys.
<p>Whilst visiting the<br>
Toilet late at night, I have<br>
Often tripped on dogs..
<p>For all their seeming<br>
Innocence, trains of thought can<br>
Be catastrophic.
<p>One over the eight.<br>
Three sheets to the wind. Force-ten<br>
Gales have fortitude.
<p>

Stirred by memories<br>
Of summer's children laughing<br>
Winter swings collide.

On the trail of come what may -<br>
Winter in his legs,

<i>The poet comments, "I submitted this last month and it wasn't posted.  I'm hoping it was just
lost, not rejected."</i>

<i>Toast Point doesn't reject anything (well, almost anything).  We're sure it got lost in cyberspace somewhere... sorry...</i>

You cannot buy drugs <br>
At euphemistic drugstores<br>
So don't even try.

A thinking tree. They grow so<br>
Ineluctably.

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 11/21/98</h3>
(He stared in despair<br>
At the blank page. Writer's block<br>
Or a passing phase?)
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I probably shouldn't be doing this, but what the heck, you only live once. The first thirty three are haiku
written before milking cows."</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point sighs and once again only posts the first ten.</i>
<p>
Making a living<br>
From doing what you love will<br>
Slowly kill your love.
<p>
Flirtation can all<br>
Too easily turn into<br>
Cohabitation.
<p>Rules are designed with<br>
Rulers in mind, not those to<br>
Whom the rules apply.
<p>They'll goad you into<br>
Going for goals that are quite<br>
Unattainable.
<p>I suppose the trick<br>
Is to listen to your own<br>
Silence. Silently.
<p>Impressionable<br>
Peasants bow and scrape to their<br>
Royal flesh and blood.
<p>An aim is drawn by<br>
Arms. Small arms or armoured tanks.<br>
What your right arm's for.
<p>I've a serious<br>
Weakness for playfulness and<br>
Levity. Heavy.
<p>One thing led, as it<br>
Inevitably does, to<br>
Yet another thing.

The light dream wings.<br>
 Mist at the road end<br>
swallows rainbow trace.

<h4>Heavy Wings</h4>
Heavy dream wings.<br>
At the end of hovering<br>
the dawn sweeps night trace.
<p>
Sand of doubtfulness.<br>
Above the cactus field, wind<br>
carries scent of rain.

<h4>Taste of Fire</h4>
The old taste of fire.<br>
Spider of silence, follows<br>
moths of oblivion.

Nothing much of note<br>
Happens in corners of the<br>
Globe that are remote.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The first two are called 'Cutting Corners.'"</i>
<p>And, presumably,<br>
The same applies to far-flung<br>
Corners of the brain.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The next three are called 'Cashing In Your Chips.'"</i>
<p>A healthy mind in<br>
A healthy body. Doctors<br>
Doctor the data.
<p>Defining health as<br>
The absence of disease, they<br>
Promote remedies.
<p>Unfortunately,<br>
Remedies cost money and<br>
Money's a disease.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The last are called 'This Is My Thesis.'"</i>
<p>'No one has ever<br>
Written a bible of how<br>
To be a poet.'
<p>Being myself a<br>
Minor practitioner, I<br>
Think of this as odd.
<p>It is, isn't it?<br>
There is no way you can teach<br>
Men to be poets.
<p>And what is doubly <br>
Odd is that true poetry<br>
Is so beautiful.
<p>I mean, you'd think there'd<br>
 Be a manual, a guide<br>
To rampant beauty.
<p>Writing poetry<br>
May well be a disease that<br>
Has no remedies.

I bought it in the<br>
Company of a woman<br>
Whom I've always loved.
<p>When I say always<br>
I mean approximately<br>
For half of my life.
<p>It's a forbidden <br>
Love. A hidden love. A love<br>
Full of foreboding.
<p>Let me draw you a<br>
Picture. I'm at a party,<br>
Talking to a chap.
<p>We're standing on a<br>
Platform looking down on a<br>
Hall full of dancers.
<p>I say "See that girl?<br>
She's the belle of the ball. So<br>
Beautiful it hurts."
<p>He follows my gaze.<br>
I say "She's the epitome of<br>
Israeli beauty."
<p>We are two English<br>
Males, so he knows what I mean.<br>
I elaborate.
<p>"You know how at the <br>
Age of seventeen these girls<br>
Become beauty queens?
<p>You know how they glow<br>
With a blinding inner light,<br>
How they have a sheen?"

It is fairly hard<br>
To lie when writing haiku,<br>
Which is fair enough.

<i>The poet comments, "The first is called 'Haiku Is Tough.' The next is called 'The Scales Will Not Fall From Your
Eyes.'"</i>

Or shower like brides.

From exotic birds but I'm<br>
Doomed to detection.

Let's get down to it. Let's let<br>
Go of what we know.

<i>The poet comments, "The next is called 'Sillily.'"</i>
<p>In your villainy<br>
You have thrown ripe tomatoes<br>
At the pillory.

<i>The poet comments, "The next is called 'The Self You Despise.'"</i>
<p>Knowing you're throwing<br>
Vegetables at yourself.<br>
Your pilloried self.

<i>The poet comments, "The next is called 'And Handcuffs.'"</i>
<p>High moral dudgeon<br>
Accompanies policemen's<br>
Truncheons. And cudgels.

<i>The poet comments, "The next is called 'Winging It.'"</i>

Word for anarchy, which is<br>
Left wing malarkey.
