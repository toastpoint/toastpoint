a newfallen snow near blooms<br>
the cherry blossoms

beauteous music from her<br>
clearing clouded minds

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 04/28/98</h3>
I've carved out a niche<br>
From which, I fancy, I will<br>
Comfortably preach.
<p>Cravings are only<br>
Temporarily assuaged<br>
Said the aged sage.
<p>A life within a life<br>
Proves only that life is<br>
Convincingly rife.
<p>Is it true that our<br>
Dreams evaporate like dew<br>
In the new sun's beams?
<p>I feel like a heel<br>
But I can't be because heels<br>
Don't feel. Not real heels.
<p>Jack the Ripper ripped<br>
Ripe fruit off the tree and slipped<br>
His knife in the skin.
<p>Stubborn as a mule<br>
I resist temptation, though<br>
I can't stop the drool.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Liposuction sucks.<br>
Both figuratively and<br>
Literally sucks.
<p>Nine to five is the<br>
Working time. Add to that the<br>
Commute. Life's a brute.
<p>Elliptic, cryptic<br>
Responses raise a rustic's<br>
Hirsute eyebrow. Hick.
<p>Java is either<br>
A language or a coffee.<br>
Either sounds or grounds.
<p>When Stygian gloom<br>
Descends on the room, Charon<br>
Feels he's in heaven.
<p>Inconvenience<br>
Shows indifference for all<br>
Forms of governance.
<p>Toilet humour is<br>
A reliable source of<br>
Titters and sniggers.
<p>The sins I enjoy<br>
Have so far failed to destroy<br>
The limbs I employ.
<p>Massage your message.<br>
Make it majestic. Mix it <br>
Meticulously.
<p>If I could extract<br>
A little extra, I'd be<br>
All that more exact.
<p>Struggling for ugly<br>
Recognition I win a<br>
Sick competition.
<p>The day's edges are<br>
Chronologically at<br>
Sixes and sevens.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Curds and whey. Whey hey<br>
Up she rises. Miss Muffet<br>
Don't like surprises.
<p>Little in the way<br>
Of minimalism strikes<br>
The reader of Joyce.
<p>Ionic columns<br>
Have two lateral volutes<br>
Of the capital.
<p>Iambi, by and<br>
By, came to mean lampoon. Don't<br>
Ask. It caught my eye.
<p>There's a love living<br>
In every living being.<br>
Dying, too, says you.
<p>Epees and foils clash<br>
With cutlasses and other<br>
Fancy cutlery.
<p>Whittling hickory<br>
Is one of those pastimes that<br>
Is now history.
<p>Ferlinghetti put<br>
His name up in lights. City<br>
Lights, to be precise.
<p>Liberace had<br>
A liberal sprinkling of<br>
Spangles and angles.
<p>Camera angles<br>
On candelabras. Boy, that<br>
Boy could smile with guile.
<p>May I propose a<br>
Toast to the moustache? Raise your<br>
Glasses to whiskers.
<p>What shall I send you?<br>
What will send you? What, my friend,<br>
Is the proper blend?

From the depths of hell,<br>
On a dragon she rides in<br>
Speaking the same fire.

As the eyes of Goneril<br>
When she looked on him.

As her very heart should be<br>
grows a thorned evil.
