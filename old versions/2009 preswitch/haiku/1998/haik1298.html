Running through the cracks<br>
It gives life to everything.<br>
That is how we live.

Trash bags of Christmas<br>
Some rat droppings left behind<br>
A cat licks its paw
<p>
<h3>Miyaunna Cleveland writes 12/29/98</h3>
The boy is crying<br>
I can see it in his eyes<br>
He wants to go home
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I've never written a haiku before. This is actually my first time writting this kind of poetry!"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:bungalow@woodland.net>Johnny Bungalow</a> writes 12/28/98</h3>
consider nature <br>
not needing thousand words to<br>
express wonderment
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The idea of haiku expressing nature when compared with western
ideals for explaining phenonenon when captured on any media, 
such as film, in a distinct slice of time."</i>
<p>
<h3>Mihajlo Mika Pavlovic writes 12/28/98</h3>
From the serene sky,<br>
in the traps of forest shadows ,<br>
the sun's might is falling.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The title : "Mightiness""</i>

<p>
Tear-shaped shadows.<br>
The bridge from willow branch-<br>
circle of dream bells.
<p>
Bridge shadows -<br>
wings of river banks.<br>
Interlaced wingless forms.

Brownish earth<br>
protruding from the snow<br>
and a hungry crow.

<h3><a href=mailto:wxgal@yahoo.com>Amy Katherine Walker</a> writes 12/28/98</h3>
Smoke-gray clouds twisting<br>
Thunder out of summer air;<br>
Lightning sears the rain.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Inspired by living in the Deep South, the most thunderstorm-prone area in the world."</i>
<p>Your smile burns the ice<br>
From haunted caverns frozen<br>
After summer’s death.

Watch the chickadees...<br>
Pecking at the seeds outside<br>
On the fallen snow.
<p>My dog's name is Champ.<br>
He is a real pain sometimes,<br>
But I still love him.
<p>
<h3>Stuart Reed writes 12/25/98</h3>
I curse the kicking <br>
Cow. How hooves hurt. And, what's more,<br>
I'm covered in dirt.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are haiku written whilst milking cows."</i>
<p>Is your claim to fame<br>
Persistent inconsistence?<br>
Are the drugs to blame?
<p>Urine assaults my<br>
Nostrils. I wipe urea<br>
Off my wet left ear.
<p>Compost is composed<br>
Of decomposition. Rot<br>
Is its rotten lot.
<p>Out of the mouths of<br>
Babbling babes comes language in<br>
Total disarray.
<p>Random fractals flood<br>
My screen. Light is both a wave<br>
And a particle.
<p>The woven wool of<br>
Long-haired, dung-spattered Afghan<br>
Sheep is fashion chic.
<p>Stern admonitions<br>
Don't dissuade me. I prefer<br>
Gentle persuasion.
<p>The rock of ages <br>
Was suddenly established<br>
In nineteen sixty.
<p>A moving picture<br>
Is now a fixture of my<br>
Static living room.
<p>We should say goodday<br>
Every day, unless, of course,<br>
We've had a bad night.
<p>Are you trenchant or<br>
Do you slip away like a<br>
Firework display?
<p>Are you a silk moth<br>
Growing fat on mulberry <br>
Leaves? If so, please weave.
<p>Are you D2R<br>
2? Are you a robot in<br>
A Star Trek movie?
<p>Out of the mouths of<br>
Cows come moos. Oddly enough,<br>
Cows are now my muse.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I've had this song on my mind all night. It's called "Yalla, Bye." It manages in two words to
incorporate three langauges - Arabic, Hebrew and English. It's also a heck of a tune. So yalla, bye."</i>

<i>The poet comments, "As a student of Haiku, I have been taught to ignore other people's attempts to disregard my use of
syllables.  As long as there is harmony or some sense of balance it is still essentially Haiku.  One can not sacrifice a breathing
Haiku just to please the syllable nazis."</i>

How foolish you are!<br>
The elder frowns at the child.<br>

feeling...Don't judge me for my years, but for my merits... "</i>

My name is Teshia Taylor... I'm 15 years old and a sophomore. I love to write all kinds of
poetry. My friends and family think I have a real talent for writing, so after my mother had a dream that I won a $25,000 poetry
contest, I started submitting some of my poems on the net.  I've had a small book that I've written all my special writings in since
fourth grade. It's very special to me and I want to share it with everyone who will appreciate it. Maybe someday..."</i>

It is fairly hard<br>
To lie when writing haiku,<br>
Which is fair enough.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The first is called 'Haiku Is Tough.' The next is called 'The Scales Will Not Fall From Your
Eyes.'"</i>
<p>I'd hide in my hide<br>
From exotic birds but I'm<br>
Doomed to detection.

How many stripes will it take<br>

An ox in a yoke.

Less easy to be lazy,<br>

Boys will stub their toes on the<br>
Fat, lazy brat's toys.

Toilet late at night, I have<br>
Often tripped on dogs..

Innocence, trains of thought can<br>
Be catastrophic.
