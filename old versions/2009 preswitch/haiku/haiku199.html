<h3><a href=mailto:wjohnall@aol.com>W. John (Allen)</a> writes 01/30/99</h3>
<h4>Solitude</h4>
In a billion stars<br>
Are we all alone ask those<br>
of Galapagos
<p>
<h3>Joyna writes 01/30/99</h3>
I have never known<br>
So why should I find out now?<br>
I will only die
<p>
<h3>Pat Grantt writes 01/30/99</h3>
Desolate the moor<br>
where, outside my solitude,<br>
wild things sometimes die.

Blackbirds pace the fence<br>
while their yellowed eyes pursue<br>
seeds of discontent.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "For the two neighbourhood gossips who cornered me last week."</i>
<p>
Flickers in the frost<br>
To the music of starlight -<br>
Phantoms of the dance.
<p>
And from nighttime prayers<br>
Through the whispers of a child<br>
They begin their flight.
<p>
<h3>Stuart Reed writes 01/30/99</h3>
Distant shotgun kills<br>
A pheasant. Hunter gets a<br>
Present of feathers.
<p>
A rapid tattoo<br>
Signals the arrival of<br>
Woody Woodpecker.
<p>
Litter on the lawn.<br>
Passers-by think that someone<br>
Ought to pick it up.
<p>Heated argument<br>
Early in the morning. A<br>
Marriage breaking up.
<p>Satellite dish on<br>
Every second roof. Inner <br>
Space from outer space.
<p>Pomegranate tree,<br>
Home to two humming birds. It's<br>
A family tree.
<p>Small, black, ugly pug<br>
Comes to visit Bubbles. She's<br>
Asking for trouble.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Bubbles is the name of my dog, so called because she dreams of being a gangster's moll."</i>
<p>Pristine clean winter<br>
Morning nonetheless teems with<br>
The litter of life.
<p>
<h3><a href=mailto:Swete03@yahoo.com>Rainbows</a> writes 01/29/99</h3>
Rainbows in the sky,<br>
Colors shining down on me,<br>
In this field of dreams.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "hope you enjoy!"</i>
<p>
<h3>Stuart Reed writes 01/29/99</h3>
"Golden Slumbers" hummed<br>
The Beatles. This is the church<br>
And here's the steeple.
<p>A guard of honour<br>
Feels to the couple like one<br>
More gauntlet to run.
<p>Exact existence,<br>
A product of persistence,<br>
Terminates in death.
<p>Time marches sideways,<br>
Always moving on, never<br>
Going anywhere.
<p>A brand new bracket<br>
Adorns the wall. Iron for<br>
A hanging basket.
<p>Itchy and Scratchy<br>
Are violent versions of<br>
Thomas and Jerry.
<p>To come home to warmth<br>
On a winter's night is a<br>
Tropical delight.
<p>Wading Wellingtons<br>
Squelch in mud, protect feet from<br>
Blood-sucking leeches.
<p>Winged Mercury had<br>
Feathers on his ankles and<br>
A hero's halo.
<p>Blessed are the bored <br>
For they shall inherit the<br>
Love of peace award.
<p>Standing ovation.<br>
Sitting duck. Grin and bear it.<br>
Curse your fucking luck.
<p>Danger's lurking in<br>
The thinking hurtling through the<br>
Circles of your mind.
<p>

Doctors of despair,<br>
Hold me tight while I seek for<br>
Doses of delight.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are called 'Spandex. Like Rolex.'"</i>
<p>Manicured fingers,<br>
Plucking at catgut, strike a<br>
Chord, strike up the band.
<p>Rhythm and booze. Mind<br>
In a rut. Nothing to choose<br>
Between creeps and sluts.
<p>Dressed to the nines. Cats<br>
And dogs do the Friday night<br>
Deodorant strut.
<p>It's the mating game,<br>
A dating game rating's war.<br>
The aim is to score.
<p>Nine times out of ten<br>
Been there, done that, wouldn't want<br>
To go there again.
<p>Once in a blue moon,<br>
June, spoon, everything sounds like<br>
A rocking new tune.
<p>Over the hills and<br>
Far away, the Pied Piper<br>
Persuasively plays.
<p>In for a penny.<br>
Listen to the hearts of the<br>
Hopeful lovelorn pound.
<p>A token gesture.<br>
A stylish lecher lights a<br>
Lady's cigarette.

How boring we are,<br>
Insisting on making love<br>
To a formula.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are haiku written whilst milking cows and are called 'Intransigent'"</i>
<p>I'm intransigent,<br>
Determined to always fly <br>
Off at a tangent.
<p>Inescapably<br>
Complicated, married life<br>
Is overrated.
<p>Lacking the substance<br>
For substance abuse is a<br>
Creative excuse.
<p>Locking horns with pawns<br>
Is not a king's job. How are <br>
The mighty fallen.
<p>Dallying scholars<br>
See term time expand to the<br>
Point of no return.
<p>Imminent chaos<br>
Circles like vultures chasing<br>
Ominous futures.
<p>Preliminary<br>
Findings establish footholds<br>
In current thinking.
<p>Where did the yellow<br>
Go? Under the bridges and<br>
Over the rainbow.
<p>Timed to perfection<br>
Every roaming pathway has<br>
One destination.

<p>So what's your story?<br>
Half-witted particulars<br>
Not hunky dory?

Worn on your epaulettes? A<br>
Chip on your shoulder.

Park figure, looming large in<br>
A trivia quiz.

Will to self-destruct.

Burns an effigy.

A pretty penny.

Than an archer's quill.

Held in death's strangling arms.<br>

Gone! Your life is over.

<p>This is why we fought<br>
Them in the trenches. We now<br>
Wield British wrenches.
<p>Beneath the bridges,<br>
Puddles of oily water<br>
Escape drying winds.
<p>Turtle-neck sweaters<br>
On today's polished youngsters<br>
Mock my blue collar.
<p>England is swinging.<br>
Not like a cadaver but <br>
With joie de vivre.
<p>The chip shop is run<br>
By a Greek. Would I go and<br>
Sell olives in Greece?
<p>Women in saris,<br>
Smelling of ghee. They avert<br>
Their doe eyes from me.
<p>I fought for the right<br>
To be free to end up in<br>
A chain factory.
