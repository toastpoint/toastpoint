Tradition triumphs over<br>
Simple good fortune.

Dame Wisdom and Lord Judgment<br>
To beg for their bread.

<i>The poet comments, "I wrote this long before
visiting this web page, so please excuse the unintentional
and entirely coincidental use of "falling leaves" as suggested
in your introduction to Haiku.  I wrote it shortly after my
girlfriend of two years and I broke up... we tried to stay friends,
but my emotions for her remained too stong (she broke up with me) and
I couldn't handle being near her without being able to hold her close.

Dark mystical night<br>
Has an arising silence<br>
Quiet and fearful

Tree frogs quiet<br>
The creek's stones sit high and dry<br>
All the children have gone.

The gum of a lie<br>
Deflated bubble of trust<br>
Stuck under my tongue
<p>
Day cracking open<br>
Light crawling over the bed<br>
Run night for cover
<p>

Candlelit white silk<br>
Smooth, soft folds pooled 'round her feet<br>
After the wedding
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Hope you're having a great vacation!"</i>
<p>

His eyes denim blue<br>
Smiling, takes her quaking hand<br>
And gives her his soul
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I was married in June, but couldn't find the right words at first."</i>

<h3>White Bird writes 08/22/97</h3>
Its a time for change<br>
Painful decisions are made<br>
But tears will bring joy
<p>

August moon rests low<br>
porthole to the universe<br>
thru indigo sky
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Thanks for a lovely site!  Visit more of my haiku at Haiku Moon (as well as others!)."</i>
<p>
Memories of you<br>
fading, a mere gentle breeze<br>
with seasons passing.
<p>

trapped in dark alone<br>
i fly toward the flame below<br>
my wings now in flames

silken flowers cream<br>
soft swirls of deep rich earth<br>
delicate and sweet

The fresh sea-air<br>
suddenly disappeared<br>
passing the fish-stall
<p>
Suddenly she,s there<br>
a mixture of sea and rain<br>
The hazy rainbow.
<p>
Circle segments around<br>
a bent-grass clump in the sand<br>
painted by the wind
<p>
Monotonous sound<br>
from a steady dripping tap<br>
outside it's raining
<p>

<h3>Sunshine writes 08/25/97</h3>
Dussler, king of fish<br>
casting, feeling, pulling trout<br>
under summer skies

<i>The poet comments, "love this site!"</i>

sweet midnight waters<br>
quench the parched and weary land ...<br>

Baby cat arrives<br>
from my hot backyard jungle<br>

cool autumn silence<br>
swallows twilight's waning flame.<br>
now the sound of rain.

hop-frogs of summer<br>
evade holy toad of death<br>

Yesterday full house.<br>
Two married, one in Marines.<br>
Woe the empty nest.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Children grow too fast to ignore spending quality time with them.
My daughters are married, my son leaves soon--he has joined the Marines; and YES,
men can suffer from empty nest syndrome......."</i>

Heavy metal bass<br>
Cries of the fallen angels<br>
Through paper thin walls

Dry stalks are brown. <br>
New stalks are pale green.<br>
Old love is a necklace of pearls.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I don't always hold to the 5-7-5 rule. Why?  I write in ideomatic American 
English. Why not?  Same answer."</i>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is the first of four haiku-like verses which loosely translate a poem by
 Göethe which likens the souls of men to water.  The rest follow."</i>
<p>
The souls of human beings<br>
Are like water<br>
Welling up from the deep.
<p>
It rises and falls<br>
Between the earth and the skies<br>
Without ceasing
<p>
As a great  cataract<br>
Pounding and thrashing<br>
It grinds boulders to sand
<p>
As the still surface of a lake<br>
It clearly reflects<br>
The distant stars
<p>

Hail to the Marines!<br>
First in, last out, none better!<br>
Now my son is one!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sempre Fi to all those Leathernecks out there who have been, are in, or are getting ready to enter the USMC!!"</i>
<p>

Divorced, still single.<br>
Both my daughters wed & gone.<br>
My son leaving soon.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Alas I am but a single man who suffers from the throes of 
"Empty Nest Syndrome".  NO, my son is NOT getting married:
He has joined the USMC!  Sempre Fi!"</i>
