I love happy days<br>

A young student came<br>
Summer visit from Japan <br>
He brought us mochi.

He shared happy days<br>
Baking and boiling mochi<br>
Serving with chopsticks

Who die each year from mochi<br>
Because it is thick.

But we are yet young<br>
We shall see many winters<br>
Still eating mochi.
