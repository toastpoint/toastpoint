<h3><a href=mailto:sergei@vms.huji.ac.il>Sergei Braun</a> writes 11/30/97</h3>
What is wrong with me?<br>
I think that stars are dust, and<br>
grains of sand are worlds.
<p>
The days are shrinking.<br>
At last, threadbare sun is gone...<br>
Never to return.
<p>
Drip-drop, drip-drop, drip.<br>
Drippity, drippity, drop.<br>
Raindrops, rain drum... Brahms?
<p>
Lifeless branches speak<br>
Sign language of the orchards,<br>
Mortals cannot read.

Your name carved on stone<br>
Too late to share the love I have<br>
I must join you soon
<p> Yes, I have no wings<br>
It is true, I cannot fly<br>
Yet I still will try
<p>
Spring and summer, spent<br>
For others, while fall days lead<br>
To my wintertime
<p>
Wings of silver lace<br>
Sound in graceful pixie flight<br>
Sweet music, princess
<p>
Butterfly kisses<br>
Gently touch my heart, closing<br>
Wounds that would not heal
<p>
<h3>J writes 11/30/97</h3>
Sunlight slowly fades<br>
Shadows move stealthily on<br>
Concealing secrets
<p>
<h3>Ross Weaver writes 11/29/97</h3>
The yearnings of mind<br>
growing from and so unlike<br>
predatory Earth
<p>where all mortals born<br>
kill, eat and change to become<br>
each need to escape
<p>as wealth empowers<br>
six billion ambitious dreams<br>
on a lost planet.

Sleep well, my darling!<br>
The sand of night is blowing<br>
Over dunes of breasts.

Willows sway gently.<br>
Boughs conduct Fall's Symphony.<br>
Winter's ear listens.

Children, gifts from God.<br>
Lessons taught by  gentle hand.<br>
Teachers once and all.

In misted vision<br>
loss is seen with clarity<br>
but hearts have not eyes.

Nut-hoarding squirrels<br>
Branches and trunks look alike<br>
Summer clothing gone

Bread cubes out drying<br>
Planned dinner for pilgrim day<br>
Pumpkin pie delight

Sliver of moon nights<br>
Ghostly clouds move slowly by<br>
What is my future?

A lamb lies in snow<br>
Vulturous birds wait to kill<br>
A collie stands guard

<i>The poet comments, "This was inspired off of a print from the 1950's of a collie dog watching over
a little lamb in the snow, and in the background there are black birds waiting to strike." </i>
<p>
Birds singing sweet tunes<br>
Flowers bursting with new hues<br>
A new life for me

uncorrupted mind.<br>
absolute oneness, essence.<br>
division is false.
<p>
seeing I seek sight<br>
reason becomes oppression<br>
singularity.
<p>
hurricane winds blow<br>
a smile unknown excites tears<br>
the aftermath, fear.

Dark skies<br>
And autumn sunset<br>
Glow like charcoal fires.

<i>The poet comments, "Syllable rule doesn't have to be rigidly adhered to in English."</i>
<p>
<i>That's true, and has been the subject of much debate on this page.</i>

Late autumn morning.<br>
Even the sun hesitates<br>
To come out early.

October sheds them,<br>
November sweeps them up, and<br>
December hides them.

Harvest moon shines bright<br>
Geese fly south in formation<br>
Winter soon will come.
<p>
Clouds drift silently<br>
Casting shadows on the ground<br>
Cat sleeps peacefully
<p>
Cold November rains<br>
Stripping soon dormant maples<br>
Ready for winter.

Little birds trickling<br>
Through branches of a pine tree<br>
Makes me long for wings.
