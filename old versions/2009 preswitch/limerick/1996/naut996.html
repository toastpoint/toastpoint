<h3>Jeeves writes 10/01/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once lived an angler named Ed<br>
Whose cock was constructed of lead<br>
Too short for a pole<br>
Or to fill a cunt hole<br>
It served as a sinker instead!

<hr>
<h3>Big Dick writes 09/30/96</h3>
I have a big dick<br>
It looks like a stick<br>
My lover likes to lick<br>
My big old stick<br>
Then right all over Nick

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Rowdy Jack's new obsessions sure are (fish)<br>
Rather strange, maybe even bizarre (fish)<br>
But <a href=#eel>his last</a> was so good,<br>
Don't you think that it should<br>
Net that maritime minstrel a star (fish)?

<p>
<I>Hee hee - oh, OK.</I>

<h3>Jeeves shares classics 09/28/96</h3>
There once was a man from Bombay<br>
Who fashioned a cunt out of clay<br>
The heat from his prick<br>
Turned it into a brick<br>
And rubbed all his foreskin away!
<p>
In the garden of Eden lay Adam<br>
Complacently stroking his Madam<br>
Great was his mirth<br>
For on all of the earth<br>
There were only two balls and he had 'em!
<p>
There once was a man from the West<br>
Who was eating his wife with great zest<br>
Amidst the grunts and the growls<br>
He sucked out her bowels<br>
And spewed liquid shit on her breast.
<p>
<I>Ewwww....</I>

<h3>Percy Longprong writes 09/28/96</h3>
I tried  it again without protection,<br>
Resulting in a nasty infection.<br>
Through tears blurred with pain ,<br>
I know I've caught AIDS again<br>
And now rely on my daily injection.

<hr>
<h3>Herkin writes 09/28/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Hallo !   My name is Herkin.<br>
All day I sit here just lurkin ' -<br>
And pulling my pud<br>
Which makes me feel good  ( as it should ! )<br>
But I'm afraid the Old Muse just ain't working!
<p>
<I>Seems to be going pretty well, actually!</I>

<h3><a name="eel">Rowdy Jack</a> writes 09/26/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A skin diving couple named Creel<br>
Found marine life held special appeal<br>
His dick he would show fish<br>
'Til blown by a blowfish<br>
While she got it on with an eel!

<hr>
<h3>Rhubarb shares a classic 09/24/96</h3>
There once was a man named Big Bart,<br>
When screwing, took much time to start.<br>
Since it took so much blood<br>
To erect the big stud,<br>
He'd go faint, and miss the best part!

<h3>Henry (The Eight's) shares a classic 09/22/96</h3>
Said Einstein, "I have an equation<br>
Which to some may appear Rabelaisian.<br>
Let `V' be `virginity'<br>
Approaching infinity<br>
And `U' the constant, `persuasion'."
<p>
"Now, if V over U be inverted,<br>
And the square root of `P' be inserted<br>
`N' times into V,<br>
The result, Q.E.D.,<br>
Is a relative", Einstein asserted!
<p>
<i>The submitter comments, "Forwarded from the mental archive of Lyel C. Behr, Ph.D.,
Dean Emeritus, Mississippi State University.   You may swap limericks with Dr. Behr.   Or, perhaps, not.  Drop him a note at:   Box 644,  Mississippi State, MS  39762."<br>

<h3>Sailor Sam shares a classic 09/20/96</h3>
There once was a couple named Kelly<br>
Who were forced to walk belly to belly<br>
Because in their haste<br>
They used library paste<br>
Instead of petroleum jelly!

<h3>Jumpin Gene shares a classic 09/19/96</h3>
There once was a yound lad from Class.<br>
Whos nuts were made out of brass.<br>
They clanged together <br>
And played Stormy Weather<br>
While lightning shot out of his ass.<br>

<hr>
<h3>Wheels shares a classic 09/19/96</h3>
A big Irish Catholic named Locks<br>
Made his living by sucking off cocks.<br>
In fits of depression,<br>
He'd go to confession<br>
And jack off the priest in the box.
<hr>
<h3>Gene Rugh shares a classic 09/19/96</h3>
There was a woman from DePaul<br>
Who wore a paper dress to a ball -<br>
The dress caught on fire<br>
And burnt her entire<br>
Front page, sports section and all!

<hr>
<h3>Dublew Ardee writes 09/16/96</h3>
There was a young lass at the lakeshore<br>
Who'd lie in the shallows and implore<br>
The gods of the sea<br>
To roll up past her knee,<br>
Her personal shoreline to explore.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:The1drer@aol.com>Wondering Fool</a> writes 09/15/96</h3>

Who liked to smoke some pole.<br>

Taking BIG pricks<br>
While huge guys nailed his hole.

<hr>
<h3>Bigus shares a classic 09/14/96</h3>
There once was a man from Kent<br>
Whose penis was so badly bent,<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:stan.mckean@kc.grapevine.com>The Barbed Bard</a> writes 09/14/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A clever young harlot named Gail<br>
Held her annual one-cent sale -<br>
The results weren't surprising:<br>
It was good merchandising<br>
But awfully hard on her tail!

<hr>
<h3>Willy Z shares classics 09/14/96</h3>
Ther once was a woman named Clair<br>
Who possessed a magnificent pair - <br>
At least thats what I thought,<br>
Till I saw one get caught<br>
On a thorn and begin to lose air!
<p>
There was a young woman named Alice<br>
She used a dynamite stick for a phallus <br>
They found her vagina<br>
In North Carolina<br>
And bits of her tits in Dallas!
<p>
There was an old whore named Sue<br>
Who filled her pussy with glue.<br>
She said with a grin, <br>
"If they pay to get in,<br>
They'll pay to get out of it too!"

<hr>
<h3>Dolphin writes 09/14/96</h3>
Here's to a lady in red dancing shoes<br>
Who liked to party and liked to booze<br>
She's lost her cherry but that ain't no sin<br>
Cause she's still got the box that cherry came in!<br>

<hr>
<h3>Sandman writes 09/14/96</h3>
Forthcoming is some very mixed prose<br>
On nursery rhymes eventually I chose<br>
About bears and pigs<br>
And a girl seen in wigs<br>
And so, this is how it goes...
<p>
A wolf asked if he could be able<br>
To join the three bears at their table,<br>
But unless I'm mistaken<br>
These chairs are all taken<br>
And this guy is in the wrong fable!
<p>
So he set off in search of his tale - <br>
Convinced of his task, he won't fail.<br>
Three pigs would be good<br>
But Red-Riding Hood<br>
Would he like for dinner (with ale).
<p>
He went looking for a house made of straw,<br>
But was amazed at what eventually he saw - <br>
A lady of the night<br>
Quite a pretty young sight<br>
Red-Riding Hood had turned into a whore!
<p>
She prefers to be called madam or lady<br>
In a trade that's ever so shady.<br>
No more does she roam,<br>
For France is her home<br>
And she's now known simply...as Sadie.
<p>
The wolf did think it his duty<br>
To rescue this voluptous beauty<br>
Away from this vice<br>
Would be very nice<br>
And stop others from touching her booty,
<p>
But alas the moment he did see her<br>
He wanted to "know her" before he could free her.<br>
He accepted her advances<br>
And suggestive glances - <br>
Now all he's got's gonnorohea!
<hr>
<a name="drroot"><h3>Dr. Root shares a classic 09/12/96</h3></a>
A lesbian sailor named Goom<br>
Took a cross-dresser up to her room.<br>
They argued for days<br>
About all of the ways<br>
And which one would do what to whom!

<hr>
<h3>Rhubarb shares a classic 09/11/96</h3>
Said old Zeus as he sat on Olympus:<br>
"Even Gods find that old age will crimp us.<br>
So far as sex goes,<br>
What once boldly arose<br>
Now requires the aid of a wimpus."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "On the off chance that you have not seen this one before, it was found
in Legman's, "The New Limerick (second series)", number 2178.
"</i>

<h3>Toast Point writes his own version:</h3>
Said Toast Point, as he sat on his rumpus:<br>
"We do not need strangers to jump us,.<br>
We've now settled down<br>
Outside New York town<br>
With our fuzzy and cuddly <a href=../wumpus.html>wumpus</a>!"

<hr>
<h3>Herkin writes 09/10/96</h3>
That utter nutter in Dumblane<br>
Fired his pistol over and over again.<br>
There was blood on the floor,<br>
On the walls, more gore<br>
And all  those little kiddies were slain.

<hr>
<h3>DJ shares a classic 09/09/96</h3>
There once was a women from Hoboken<br>
Who claimed that her cherry was broken<br>
By riding a bike<br>
On a cobblestone pike,<br>
But it really was broken from poken!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:govind@ssnotes.mt.att.com>Govindhan Padmavijayam</a> writes 09/06/96</h3>
Consider the commonplace cantaloupe<br>
You can't use it to make a good soup<br>
  I liked the tomato better<br>
  Until one day, I met her,<br>
My wife, who insists that cantaloupe's good for the poop!
<p>

<h3>Stargazer writes 09/06/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The convention was packaged and slick;<br>
Mr. Clinton's speech sure did the trick.<br>
But alas!  He's dismayed;<br>
For a change, he's betrayed<br>
By his OTHER philandering Dick!
<p>
Mr. Morris, worn out, I suppose,<br>
In a meeting slipped into a doze,<br>
So he got it confused<br>
When Bill Clinton enthused:<br>
"Lick the enemy; keep on your toes."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:maddog@netset.com>The Maddog</a> writes 09/06/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
'Twas 10 years ago I got wedded<br>
Then she chopped off my schlong, had it threaded!<br>
Now she keeps it in her purse<br>
And to make matters worse<br>
She only screws it back on when we're bedded!

<hr>
<h3>Raging Bull writes 09/05/96</h3>
A producer, who was an old fogey,<br>
Asked young Betty to munch on his stogey.<br>
But it wasn't his age<br>
That filled her with rage -<br>
After all, she soon married old Bogie!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A wan lexicon known as Boris<br>
Was fondling his sweetheart's clitoris.<br>
Said he, "No words have I<br>
To describe such hair pie.<br>
For that, I will need my thesaurus."
<p>
While working one day in the poolyard<br>
With a friend whom I've known since the schoolyard,<br>
I corrected his grammar<br>
When I borrowed his hammer.<br>
He said, "Pal, this ain't fuckin' Julliard."

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There was an old maid from Hoboken<br>
Who was taught that sex was verboten,<br>
So when she was dead,<br>
Her epitaph read,<br>
"Returned to sender unopened."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Don't know why my <a href=naut896.html#Janna>Janna from Montana</a> last month came up "anonymous", as I am no more ashamed of that one than any of the others I write."<br>
Toast Point responds, "If there's no name in the Pen Name field, I post it as anonymous.  It's fixed now.  Thanks for letting me know!"</i>
<p>
The Republicans sounded the alarm,<br>
"The unborn shall not be harmed,<br>
For birth control<br>
Is easy!" says Dole,<br>
Whose dick hangs like his right arm.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I hope not, for his and Libby's sake, as after November they are going to have a lot of time for fun."</i>

Says a diver: "My dear, you are sore, eh?<br>
From some dildoing on the sea floor ,eh?<br>
And pray tell me," he cries<br>
"What's that snake twixt your thighs?"<br>
"That's no snake," she replies, "that's a moray."

Muff divers by Cupid are beaten<br>
When they fall for a mermaid's entreatin'<br>
With her bottom half fish,<br>
'Tis an unfulfilled wish<br>
With a dish that can never be eaten!

<a name="cousteau">Said an injured Cousteau,"I implore all</a><br>
Of my divers to stick with sex oral - <br>
Having just tried to screw<br>
On a bed, 'neath the blue<br>
Where the beds, you will note, are of coral."

<h3>Bluey shares a classic 09/01/96</h3>
There was a young girl from Cape Cod<br>
Who thought that her child came from God<br>
It wasn't the Almighty<br>
Who lifted her nighty<br>
But Roger the lodger - the sod!
