A nubile young Finn on her skis<br>
Shouted out: "Look at me! Look at these!"<br>
  As she sped down the switchback<br>
  Dressed only in pitch black<br>
Nipple caps and a see-through chemise!

"Hey, waiter, my soup's got a fly in,<br>
And it looks like the poor fly is dyin'!<br>
Will the Heimlich maneuver<br>
Help him to recover?"<br>
"I doubt it... well, not without dryin'"

<p>If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He’d have made his lone way  to L.A.<br>
Where he’d have to give head<br>
To the guys with the bread<br>
If he wanted to put on a play!

The pussy’s not much of a sight:<br>
To reveal it is thought impolite<br>
  But the pussy appeals<br>
  In the way that it feels<br>
When you slide into mine in the night!

A curious mammal's the beaver<br>
When sniffed out by a canine retriever<br>
Slips under the lake<br>
It's its habit to make<br>
And splits without using a cleaver.

If Melissa arrives in your box<br>
With I-sites where you get off your rocks,<br>
While you're viewing pudenda<br>
Melissa will send a<br>
Fresh copy to fifty more jocks!

Not the animal-- but the "receiver"<br>

A gent's sausage inside<br>
A grand prize for the overachiever!

<h3>Bakai writes 03/30/99</h3>
My love, Marylou, likes to bleat<br>
While I'm munching away on her treat.<br>
She knows that her noise<br>
Befuddles my poise<br>
So she muffles my ears with her feet!

<h3>Bakai writes 03/29/99</h3>
My sweet Marylou, heaven knows<br>
Is blessed with a big bulbous nose<br>
Sometimes, while she gums me<br>
She'll hold it quite chumly<br>
Poor thing, she thinks it's my globes!

<i>The poet comments, "More poetic license. You think this is easy?"</i>

Lest her talents remain yet unsung<br>
I must mention my Marylou's tongue<br>
Though I love it inside<br>
Every gap in my hide<br>
I prefer her big toe in my bung!

<i>The poet comments, "Have I no shame?"</i>
<p>Hot sex with my gal is the best<br>
Though, at times, Marylou likes to rest<br>
I've never complained<br>
I'm quite entertained<br>
Just quietly shaving her chest!

A sexy young woman called Eve<br>
Wore her pussy upon her left sleeve<br>
And her heart on the right<br>
For doubled delight<br>
And something else you won't believe!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is the first part of a short story"</i>
<p>Her good friend Alonso said: "Eve,<br>
I am drawn to the scent of your sleeve<br>
May I kiss your left wrist?<br>
Oh please? I insist!<br>
It’s the highest bliss I could achieve."
<p>
Said Eve to Alonso, "You may<br>
Kiss me first on the right and then play<br>
Your tongue up and down<br>
The left sleeve of my gown,<br>
But make sure that you do it all day."

<p>
Said Alonso to her, "Darling Eve<br>
All day long’s far too short for your sleeve.<br>
Is the rest of your life<br>
(If you’ll just be my wife)<br>
Long enough? Otherwise I must leave."
<p>
Said Eve to Alonso, "Please stay<br>
Both my sleeves say: ‘Don’t go away.’<br>
You’re melting my hips<br>
With the touch of your lips<br>
On my sleeves. Please continue, I pray."
<p>
Said Alonso, "I can’t get enough,<br>
And I’m charmed by this sweet little ruff...<br>
So I shall, (by your leave)<br>
Warm my face in your sleeve<br>
As one warms one’s hands in a muff."

<p>
Said Eve to Alonso, "Sweet chap,<br>
Leave my sleeve, come, and lie in my lap.<br>
Though your ardour’s not cooled<br>
I fear you’ve been fooled<br>
By this poetic metaphor crap."

The man from Nantucket was brave<br>
When he found a dead whore in a cave:<br>
He canned the green meat<br>

<h3>Wee Willy Winkle shares a classic 03/28/99</h3>
One night a girl had an affair<br>
With a fellow all covered with hair<br>
When she picked up his hat<br>
she realized that<br>
She'd been screwed by Smokey the Bear!<p>
There once was a lady from Norway<br>
Who hung by her heels in a doorway - <br>
She told her young man<br>
"Get off the divan"<br>
"I think I've discovered one more way!"

I went to a bar on the strand<br>
To hear my friend's naturist band<br>
They're gorgeous brunettes<br>
And they finished their set<br>
To the sound of one clapping hand.

On hearing the Presidents distress,<br>
Young Monica couldn't care less!<br>
She said, "I'd rather fuck<br>
And describe in my book<br>
Than clean out the cum from my dress!"

<h3>Bakai writes 03/28/99</h3>
My dear Marylou, every morn<br>
Eats a waffle while looking at porn<br>
The syrup that drips<br>
From her pink puffy lips<br>
She reuses in spite of my scorn!
<p>
My dove Marylou's quite a slob - <br>
Makes a mess while licking my knob.<br>
But I don't dare protest<br>
It's a nuisance, at best<br>
Just thoughts while I watch her head bob.

<p>My gnarly old crank ain't a prize<br>
But it's grand in Marylou's eyes<br>
She tells me it's cute<br>
And she won't give a hoot<br>
'Til the day it fails to rise.

<p>My love Marylou's quite a flirt<br>
Loves to tease my best friend, Big Bert<br>
Once, out having dinner<br>
She pulled out his winner<br>
And fondled it during dessert!

<p>
My gal, Marylou, with a grin,<br>
Got up so to let her folks in.<br>
I should have wiped off<br>
With a tissue or cloth<br>
Those gobs of my goo on her chin!

<p>

A statesmanly woman named Hillary<br>

All this billin’ and cooin’<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:bakai@grumpydog.com>Bakai</a> writes 03/27/99</h3>
Oft times my sweet gal, Marylou<br>
Will color her boobies bright blue<br>
Though clever with paint<br>
An artist she ain't<br>
The damn things still hang quite untrue!
<p>
My gal, Marylou, seems to drool<br>
Whenever she sits on my tool<br>
Because I can't rest<br>
With her spit on my chest<br>
She must wear a bib, that's my rule!
<p>
My love, Marylou, throws a fit<br>
Each time that I nibble her clit<br>
She says I'm a fool<br>
To be ever so cruel<br>
While her teeth are so close to my sprit!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Poetic license."</i>
<p>My pet Marylou's big pudendum <br>
Is quite a handful, and then some<br>
I'm told there are sweeter<br>
Much smaller and neater<br>
If you've got any pictures, please send them!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Really stretching for this one."</i>
<p>When my dove, Marylou, passes gas<br>
It's more than a poof from her ass<br>
There's a thunderous din<br>
Plus a shredding of skin<br>
And a settling of dust in your glass.

<p>My squeeze, Marylou, might be dizzy<br>
And her belly hair is kinda frizzy<br>
But after one beer<br>
She does something dear<br>
She takes out her teeth and gets busy!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "That's enough for one day."</i>

There was an old codger named Straw<br>
Who developed a terrible flaw<br>
His prostate grew large<br>
Cock wouldn't discharge<br>
Certainly no cause for hurrah!

<p>
He went to a doctor named Mike<br>
Who said "You may be far down the pike<br>
We'll give you a ream<br>
To bring back your stream.<br>
That will certainly open the dike."

<p>The reaming was done with dispatch<br>
Now no other his performance can match<br>
His erections are bigger<br>
He fucks with great vigor<br>
He's now the best catch in the batch.

Mr Fisher confessed to his priest :<br>
"I'm afraid that I've been an old beast .<br>
My kink is to peep<br>
Shearers fornicate sheep -<br>
But discretion I practice at least ! " 

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Hmmm....Is this one gold star worthy ? A shearer is the guy
that cuts the wool
off the sheep - is that what you guys call them ? ( I'll slowly educate you
Yankees in Aussie slang ). Tim Fisher is our deputy Prime Minister , a sheep farmer
and by the looks of it a deviant ."</i>

There was a girl from Tallahassee<br>
She had a large and impressive chassis<br>
When she walked down the road<br>
With her quite ample load<br>
She  kept all of the "ass men" enraptured!

Our robotic vice president Gore<br>
Always sticks out his hand to get more<br>

Developed a passion for tennis.<br>

<h4>from Vassar Smith</h4>
A boy who loved chocolate cake,     <br>
One day made an awful mistake.      <br>
He devoured three packs     <br>
Of the stuff called Ex-Lax...       <br>
Now he's thin as the shaft of a rake!       
    <p>

<h4>from Loren C. Fitzhugh </h4>
'Twas the ride of their lives I must say,   <br>
So he asked, "Could we marry today?"<br>
She said, "Sure, grab your shoes,   <br>
Your socks, and that booze. <br>
We just might not come back this way."      
    <p>

<h4>from Thomas M. Patton </h4>
An impotent composer named Rohr     <br>
Couldn't satisfy girls any more.    <br>
He really belongs   <br>
Writing Broadway songs,     <br>
As it's the only way he can score.  
    <p>

<h4>from Loren C. Fitzhugh </h4>
The contentious Geologist, Schmaltz,<br>
Knew his igneous rocks and basalts. <br>
He then took a degree       <br>
In Seismology,      <br>
Succeeding in spite of his faults.  
    <p>
<h4>from Tom Patton</h4>
He proposed to a gal named Lilly.   <br>
She is a most beautiful filly. <br>
Not only that, <br>
Her stomach is flat, <br>
While the rest of her body is hilly.
<p>

<h4>from Joshua M. Levine    P9710</h4>
Consider the beetles of dung<br>
Whose praises need to be sung.      <br>
This industrious species    <br>
Buries animal feces,<br>
Which all other beasts have flung.  
<p>
<h4>from Chris Bolivar    </h4>
There once was a man name of Faber; <br>
His wife had ten kids through much labor.   <br>
He said, "They're all mine!"<br>
She said, "No, just nine,   <br>
The youngest one came from our neighbor."   
    <p>
<h4>from Al Willis</h4>
When she walks on the beach, my girl Tess,  <br>
Her rear shows a lovely excess.     <br>
Her cute bathing suit       <br>
Sends men in pursuit.       <br>
It's true that she has a largesse.  
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo  </h4>
It's absolutely uncanny,    <br>
From teens right up to my granny,   <br>
When a female walks by,     <br>
My magnificent eye  <br>
Immediately zooms to her fanny.     
    <p>

<h4>from B. Tepper</h4>
A nice college boy from Bolivia     <br>
Joined a new game of off-color trivia.      <br>
But he couldn't compete     <br>
With the vulgar elite;      <br>
He was woefully weak in lascivia.   
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 7    </h4>
The lady wore under her dress,      <br>
A tupperware bra on her chest.      <br>
It didn't fit great <br>
Or lift and separate,       <br>
But it kept what she had, nice and fresh.   
    <p>

<h4>from Mike Dale</h4>
Anita, the film star attests,       <br>
That she easily passed her screen tests,    <br>
With a will to succeed,     <br>
Great talent indeed,<br>
And a pair of quite beautiful breasts.      
    <p>

<h4>from Joyce Johnson    </h4>
The Old Woman Who Lived In A Shoe,  <br>
Whacked all of her kids black and blue.     <br>
If only she had     <br>
Seen a birth control ad,    <br>
Then she would have known what to do.       
    <p>
<h4>from Mr Malo   </h4>
Michael Jackson is the strangest sort;       <br>
Has a pet chimpanzee just for sport.<br>
They aren't much for titties,       <br>
But then neither are kiddies,       <br>
And they can't haul your ass into court.    
    <p>

<h4>from Daniel Ford      </h4>
VITRIOLIC came from glassidity,     <br>
And caustic effects of acidity.     <br>
Today there's so much       <br>
Angry speech and such,      <br>
We think that one is just gassidity.
    <p>

<h4>from Paul Chernoff    </h4>
A rabbi, a priest, and a nun<br>
Decided to have some good fun.      <br>
But they're all so religious<br>
And highly litigious --     <br>
That I fear that my story is done.  
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo  </h4>
Two things about wearing a kilt:    <br>
It's definitely handily built       <br>
For fucking a lass, <br>
But a breeze up the ass     <br>
Makes a hardon rapidly wilt.
    <p>

<h4>from vol 6    </h4>
A mistress who lives near the Tweed <br>
Has developed a singular creed;     <br>
She will not coo and bill,  <br>
Or provide a cheap thrill,  <br>
Till convinced there's a genuine need.      
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 10   </h4>
There once was a man from Van Isle, <br>
Who said jogging just wasn't his style.     <br>
"I get workouts," he said,  <br>
"At home, in my bed,<br>
'Cause a Miss is as good as a mile."
    <p>

<h4>from John Miller      </h4>
On the couch, right away, Santa spied       <br>
A voluptuous girl, legs spread wide.<br>
"Won't you stay", purred this beauty,<br>
He said, "Hell with my duty!<br>
I can't fit back up if I tried!"    
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 1    </h4>
A Cajun gourmet named LaSalle       <br>
Is the chef at that place on Canal. <br>
He puts lots of spice       <br>
On your red beans and rice, <br>
And makes lightning shoot out of your bowel!
    <p>

<h4>from Scott Hendricks  </h4>
A randy marsupial, Reeves,  <br>
Spent some time with some whores 'twixt their knees.<br>
When they ask him for money,<br>
He'd say, "Listen, Honey,   <br>
A koala eats bushes and leaves."    
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo  </h4>
The limerick, a bastard art,<br>
And though it may come from the heart,      <br>
Is thought of as cheesy,    <br>
Sometimes even sleazy;      <br>
A kind of poetic fart.      
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 7    </h4>
I have written some limericks quite fateful,<br>
Malicious and vicious and hateful;  <br>
But I've torn up the jokes  <br>
That would sicken most folks,       <br>
And humanity ought to be grateful.  
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo  </h4>
Texas is known for the steer,       <br>
For oil and Lone Star Beer, <br>
For horses and cattle,      <br>
And the Alamo battle<br>
That was won by that Mexican queer. 
    <p>

<h4>from Kaylin Brandon   </h4>
Mama told me one long-ago night,    <br>
(And I'm sure that Mama must have been right)       <br>
She said girls and boys     <br>
Shouldn't play with their toys.     <br>
It will make them go blind, how's your sight?       
    <p>

<h4>from Robyn    </h4>
It most necessarily follows,<br>
Her moist curves and all her hollows,       <br>
Though exceedingly fine,    <br>
At best make her a nine;    <br>
A ten is a nine who swallows.       
    <p>

<h4>from Scott Hendricks  </h4>
A nice twisted wench from Capreeze, <br>
Orgasmed each time she would sneeze.<br>
To the druggest she went,   <br>
And laid down her last cent;<br>
"A barrel of snuff, if you please." 
    <p>

<h4>from Vol 10   </h4>
Lorena reacted quite bitterly       <br>
When John failed to service her clitorally. <br>
Though he got a reprieve,   <br>
When his tool was retrieved,<br>
When John jerks off now, it is literally.   
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo   </h4>
Nothing personal in the slightest,  <br>
But Quayle's brains are the lightest.       <br>
But you can't make fun of   <br>
The fact that he's one of   <br>
The GOP's best and the brightest!   
    <p>

<h4>from John Miller      </h4>
The best saleswhiz in history, it's plain,  <br>
Was one Mary: with lots to explain. <br>
Got the whole world believing       <br>
Her way of conceiving       <br>
Was "immaculate," free from all stain.      
    <p>

<h4>from Daniel Ford      </h4>
Saint Peter was tired at the gate,  <br>
And sought his hunger to sate.      <br>
So he asked Jesus,  <br>
With many pleases,  <br>
To stand in while he got a plate.   
    <p>

Then there came a hobbling old man, <br>
With his cane and white hair and deep tan.  <br>
Jesus thought that he knew  <br>
This grey old man who       <br>
Had a spine all curved like a fan.  
    <p>

Jesus asked, "Wouldst carpenter be?" <br>
"Yes, but am I acquainted with thee?"       <br>
Then Jesus asked more       <br>
Of the man with four score, <br>
"Have a son who left you in the lee?"       
    <p>

The Old One replied, "Yes, I did so."       <br>
"Had he holes in his hands, do you know?" <br>
"Yes, indeed, rather!" <br>
Then Jesus cried "Father!" <br> 
Mused the grey beard, "Pinocchio??" 
<p>

<h4>from VOL 7    </h4>
"Can't you fools see where this is all leading,     <br>
This nightmare of selective breeding?"      <br>
he spat on the ground       <br>
And then turned around,     <br>
And continued on with his weeding.  
    <p>

<h4>from Ron Ellin</h4>
If all the gnus in the London Zoo   <br>
Disappeared forever,<br>
You'd have to say   <br>
That's the end of the gnus, <br>
And now it's time for the weather.  
    <p>

<h4>from Kevin's Limerick Page    </h4>
There was a young lady named Dinah, <br>
Who had the world's largest vagina. <br>
She filled it with rocks    <br>
To keep out the cocks;      <br>
In the end, she married a miner.    
    <p>

<h4>from Mr Malo  </h4>
I once knew a man with a horse,     <br>
Which he fucked as a matter of course.      <br>
Though it wasn't real pretty<br>
And smelled a bit shitty,   <br>
He'd had pussy that smelled a lot worse.    
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 7    </h4>
The night was almost gone;  <br>
I opened my eyes with a yawn.       <br>
I was quite amazed  <br>
With her thighs on my face; <br>
I was seeing the crack of Dawn.     
    <p>
<h4>from Frank Spectra     </h4>
Forty's a wonderful age.    <br>
You'll offer advice like a sage.    <br>
But if you should doubt     <br>
Old libido's clout, 
A Ferrari in RED is the rage.   <p>    
<p>
<h4>from Ron Rubin</h4>
Italians love Paganini,     <br>
Puccini and Signor Rossini; <br>
But lately I've found       <br>
They're more thrilled by the sound  <br>
Of an expertly tuned Lamborghini.   
    <p>

<h4>from John Miller      </h4>
A blacksnake crept up drunk Jake's thigh,   <br>
Who exclaimed, when it popped out his fly,  <br>
"Big and black, that ah knowed,     <br>
But my! Yo' has growed.     <br>
And whe'fo yo' beady blue eye?      
    <p>

<h4>from Lloyd Rawley     </h4>
A sex-crazed safari guide, Brian,   <br>
Thought a lioness might be worth tryin'.    <br>
To his joy, she was game,   <br>
And remarkably tame.<br>
But that couldn't be said for the lion.     
    <p>

<h4>from VOL 3    </h4>
There once was a lady named Thalia; <br>
Who with men, was an absolute failure.      <br>
But what she could do       <br>
With a male kangaroo,       <br>
Astounded the men of Australia.     
    <p>

<h4>from Bill     </h4>
Michael Jackson, his skin is so fairish,    <br>
And his behavior outrageously garish.       <br>
I've heard it's been said,  <br>
"One more young boy in bed, <br>
And the church will give him his own parish."       
    <p>

<h4>from Frank Fazed      </h4>
The reason, all can understand,     <br>
Why Jim's punch on Joe's jaw did land.      <br>
"I saw your name, Joe,      <br>
Written in the snow;<br>
The writing was in my wife's hand!" 
    <p>

<h4>from James Murray     </h4>
Cold drafts can make Scots get sick,<br>
When kilts and not pants they do pick.      <br>
Surely you blunder  <br>
By asking what's under,     <br>
And learning it's your wife's lipstick.     
    <p>

<h4>from Karen    </h4>
Find someone else? Why you creep!   <br>
After me dressing up as Bo Peep!!!  <br>
How was I to know   <br>
Your passion won't grow     <br>
Unless I dressed up as a sheep!     
    <p>

<h4>from Paul M. Hoffman  </h4>
Marie, on the brink of disaster,    <br>
Went off to speak with her pastor;  <br>
She feared what he'd think  <br>
Of her troubles with drink, <br>
But lucky for her, he was plastered.
