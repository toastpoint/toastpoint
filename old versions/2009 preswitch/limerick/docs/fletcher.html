1. I think it helpful to discuss structure to some degree.  True, we can
learn by osmosis, but advice can speed up the process.  The following
discussion is going to assume basic knowledge of the rhyme scheme and at
least some acquaintance with basic ideas of beat patterns and rhythm in
poetry.
<p>
2.  For a reference source, I am relying on Lure of the Limerick,
Baring-Gould, current edition, Barnes and Noble 1993 (orig. 1967).  This
book is well-known and covers a broad spectrum of clean, obscene, and
in-between. Also, the author discusses style to some extent, although not
systematically.
<p>
3. In most of the limericks given in Lure, the beat patterns are as follows:
<p>
1,2,5   w [w] S w w S w w S [w] [w]<br>
3,4     w {w] S w w S [w]
<p>
4. Here w is a weak beat and S is a strong beat.  The brackets indicate
that the beat is optional and is often omitted.  I checked Lure, A and B,
and found that 53 out of 56 fit the general framework given above for all
five lines.  Most of them failed to fit the 8-8-5-5-8 pattern mentioned in
the letter to Eric, because at least one of the five lines had two weak
beats in front of the first strong beat.  Also many had an extra weak beat
at the end of either lines 125 or 34 or both.  As Eric indicates, the
crucial requirement is for the number of feet and hence the number of
strong beats to be correct: 3-3-2-2-3.  True, it can be done by ear, but
counting helps if one is learning.
<p>
5. Just as Eric has explained, the last strong beat rhymes and any weak
beats following the strong beats must be present and have the same sound
for rhyming lines.  The first w after the last S is quite common (nearlly
half the time), but the second one is fairly rare (only 3 of 56).  Also
lines 3 and 4 can possibly have two weak beats at the end, but it is rare
enough that I (like Eric) will omit it.  My explanation here is basically
the same as Eric's.
<p>
6.  Next, consider the optional second w in front of the first S.  This
beat is clearly allowed, and its presence or absence may be vary over all
lines and they do not have to match.  For example the lady from Niger (or
Riga) gets two weak beats at the start of lines 3, 4, and 5, even though
she did not enjoy them nearly as much as the young lady of Kent who gets
them only for lines 3 and 4.  Readers may want to check out the following
examples from Lure.
<p>
Tiger:         (12)wSwwSwwSw (34)wwSwwS (5)wwSwwSwwSw<br>
83: Star:      (125)wwSwwSwwS (3)wwSwwSw (4)wSwwSw<br>
117:antigue    (1)wSwwSwwS (25)wwSwwSwwS (3)wSwwS (4)wwSwwS (5)wwSwwSwwS<br>
120:Baker      (15)wSwwSwwSw (2)wwSwwSwwSw (34)wSwwSw<br>
123:Benin      (125)wSwwSwwSw (3)wSwwSw (4)wwSwwSw<br>
125:Birmingham (12)wSwwSwwSww (34)wSwwS (5)wwSwwSwwSww<br>
178 Kent:      (125)wSwwSwwS (34)wwSwwS<br>
<p>
7.  For the 53 of 56 strictly conforming cases, the break-downs were as follows:
<p>
Weak syllables at start:<br>
Line 1:   44 with 1;  9 with 2<BR>
Line 2:   32 with 1; 21 with 2<BR>
Line 3:   23 with 1; 32 with 2<br>
Line 4:   25 with 1; 28 with 2<br>
Line 5:   26 with 1; 27 with 2
<p>
Extra weak syllables at end<br>
Lines 1,2,5:  30 with none;  21 with 1;  2 with 2<br>
Lines 3,4:    44 with none;   9 with 1
<p>
8.  Note that the vast majority had just one leading weak beat at the start
of line one, Much of this is due to the stock phrase "There was a[n]," but
it probably goes further than that.  The basic anapestic rhythmn is two
shorts and a long, but one can imagine a pause at the start of a line
(replacing a beat), and this effect may be stronger in in line 1.
<p>
9. The three exceptional cases were:
<p>
(a) 115:Algiers. Lines 3 and 4 have two weak repeated beats at the end.<p>
Also with these lines I had some difficulty getting the second beats to be
stronger than the third.  The pattern appears to be: (12)wwSwwSwwS
(34)wSwwSww (5)wSwwSwwS, but I would not want to push my views of lines 3
and 4.
<p>
(b) 116:Amazon.  This is not really a limeric, since the beat is iambic,
rather than anapestic.  The pattern is (125)wSwSwSwS (34)wSwS.  Nifty poem
though.
<p>
(c) 121:Bates. (125)wSwwSwwS (3)wSwwSw (4)SwwSw.  Everything conforms
except that Line 4 has no weak beats before "rend," which is obviously
strong.  I assume that a justification would be that "rend" is not merely
strong, but awesome and needs no buildup.
<p>
10. Although this might seem to some like just the sort of thing a pedant
might do to spoil the fun, I thing it might prove to be illuminating to
some of the less experienced.  Please let me defend my emphasis as follows:
<p>
<i>
My limericks disparage Japan,<br>
Insult frogs and the first nation man.<br>
They depict girls as just<br>
Things for masculine lust,<br>
But, by jingo, they rhyme and they scan!
</i><br>
