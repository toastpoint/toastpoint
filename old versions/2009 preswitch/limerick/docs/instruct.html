<h2>Instructions</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
The Toast Point, his brain getting warm,<br>
Has learned how to generate forms<br>
And wishes his readers<br>
To see who is sweeter<br>
At writing a limerick poem.
</td>
<td>
While making your choice, do think twice<br>
Decide if you're naughty or nice<br>
Then write up your entry<br>
Submit to the sentry<br>
And do it lots - can't beat the price!
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
To fill in your poem delectable<br>
A list of first lines is selectable<br>
But if these you don't like<br>
Tell 'em "just take a hike"<br>
And write your own line - that's respectable.
</td>
<td>
Your entry will be judged by a sage<br>
Where its relative worth will be gauged.<br>
And the poems that glitter<br>
Get stars for submitters<br>
Displayed on the month's contest page!
