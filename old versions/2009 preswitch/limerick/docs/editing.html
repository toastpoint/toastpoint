Toast Point replies to the title question with "well, it's my contest".  However, 
he wishes to be fair and below explains when and why the Sage edits entries, 
and 
when the Sage does not.<p>
<h3>Spelling and Punctuation</h3>
Generally, the sage will correct spelling unless it's obvious that the 
misspelling is deliberate.<br>
The sage has also instructed Toast Point to capitalize the first word of 
each line, except when requested otherwise.  Nom de plumes (noms de plume?) are 
also capitalized, unless it is obviously an e-mail address.<p>
It is perfectly fine for poets to request that the Toast Point Contests 
<i>not</i> edit entries or pen names.  For instance, <em>Victoria...</em> and 
<em>J0yce</em> have unusually-punctuated pen names, are consistent with their 
usage and so they are left unedited.  <em>Victoria...</em> has also requested that 
her capitalization, punctuation and so on be left alone.  As she is a fine poet, 
and savvy as well, the Sage bows to her request.<p>

<h3>Meter and Structure</h3>
Toast Point frequently receives 
haiku and limerick entries that do not follow form.  
This has not been unusual 
for the Haiku contest, where the debate on the five/seven/five rule has 
continued for some time.  For haikus, it doesn't matter so much, but 
a limerick must be rhythmically correct to work.  (See 
<a href=formhint.html>Hints on Structure</a> if you need help with 
limerick form.)  If a limerick doesn't quite work rhythmically, 
the Sage will 'tweak' the limerick, aiming to keep the meaning 
and improve the flow.  If this is impossible, the Sage will merely 
comment on this in an attached note.  <p>
Again, as 
<a href=../1995/niceoct.html#Govindhan>Govindhan Padmavijayam</a> so cleverly did, poets 
are able to request that their entries remain untouched.  
To do this, just tell us in the Comments box in the Entry form.
