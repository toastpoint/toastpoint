The <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mgh1001/limericks.html">ZUM'95 Limericks Competition</A> 
greeting page has a lovely scholarly definition, but you may also find this helpful:<p>

I don't know if you're the authority<br>
That will impart the absolute truth to me<br>
But I'm not really sure<br>
Just what is the structure<br>
Of the limericks I'm slaughtering brutally.<p>

Is it just 8 8 5 5 8<br>
Or is it 8 8 6 6 8<br>
Can syllables be crammed<br>
And more than eight be jammed<br>
To keep the meter read at the same gait?<p>

My girlfriend and I can't tell<br>
What makes these little rhymes swell<br>
Please write me back<br>
And teach me the knack<br>
Of writing a limerick well!<p>
What I really need to know is whether or not syllable cramming is 
allowed, or whether the exact number of syllables MUST equal the 
assigned number for the line.  And, is there an exact number of 
syllables assigned for each line?<p>
Thanks for your time.<p>

For expediency, Toast Point did not phrase his reply in limerick form, but it covered 
the bases nonetheless:<p>

The number of syllables is not as important as the beat pattern:<br>

da DA-da-da DA-da-da DA-(da) (da)<BR>
da DA-da-da DA-da-da DA (da) (da)<BR>
da DA-da-da DA (da)<BR>
da DA-da-da DA (da)<BR>
da DA-da-da DA-da-da DA (da) (da)<P>

Meaning that you can leave off the syllables in parentheses, but 1,2 
and 5 should match each other, and 3 and 4 should match.<P>

For instance:<BR>
<EM>There ONCE was a GIRL from nanTUCKet</EM>  - leaves off the final (da)<BR>
<EM>A MAIDen whose NAME was feLIcity</EM> - uses all of them<p>

It's more important that the STRESSES of the word be on the 
strong beats than to have exactly the right number of syllables.
