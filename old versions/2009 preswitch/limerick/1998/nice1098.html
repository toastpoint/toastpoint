His Honour Lord Richard of Bast<br>
On a holiday cruise breathed his last.<br>
He succumbed to the creeps<br>
When out of the deeps<br>
Rose the daughters he'd drowned in years past.

With all due respect, it's agreed,<br>
The beaver's a curious breed.<br>

<h3>Annette Funicello writes 10/07/98</h3>
The boys and the girls at my school<br>
Are so unbelievably cruel<br>
They untied my shoe<br>
Fed me Elmer's glue<br>
Laughed and then called me a fool.
<p>
I once tried to eat soap and rice<br>
Covered with pickles and mice<br>
It was such a mess<br>
(Stained my new dress)<br>
However, it tasted quite nice.

Who could travel faster than light<br>
So she went out one day<br>
In a relative way,<br>

To forget INS<br>
And sneak in past a night border guard!

There was a young lawyer named Burke,<br>
Who acquired a curious quirk.<br>
The drugs that he used,<br>
Often left him confused,<br>
