<h3>Ray Hemphill writes 04/30/98</h3>
He saw Divine Brown on her knees<br>
As she worked ever harder to please.<br>
An actor named Grant<br>
Had just started to pant<br>
When the sheriff said, "Smile and say cheese."

<i>The poet comments, "When the above incident was in the news, 
I made an audiotape of this limerick and mailed it to the CEO of Kodak with the suggestion 
that he might want to use it in a commercial as an example of a Kodak Moment.  
Evidently he didn't care for my suggestion.  I just don't understand it.  
I still haven't heard from him."</i>

<h3>CB <a name="crete2">writes</a> more stanzas to 
<a href=#crete1>The Lady from Crete</a> 04/29/98</h3>
Now the lady from Crete and her Jack<br>
And the cyclist, with Harley so black<br>
Were hitting the road<br>
When she dropped a new load --<br>
An equestrian, pony, and tack!
<p>
Do you think she could put them all back<br>
If all four of them now hit the sack?<br>
Maybe she could fit more<br>
(Like, say, Dave with dead whore,)<br>
If she gave a good whack to the stack!

The reason she wasn't seducible,<br>
Her bod was obese, irreducible.<br>
His rod was too short,<br>
Causing sperm to abort.<br>
This rendered her irreproducible.

Breast-fed babies are hearty and hale.<br>
But this process is strange to the male.<br>
What tells babies to tipple - <br>
Are those bumps round the nipple<br>
Reading, "Suck here when thirsty" , in Braille?

<h3>You Don't Want to Know who writes 04/28/98</h3>
There was a young lady called Ash<br>
Who suffered from a horrible rash<br>
She scratched till she flaked<br>
And her vagina felt raked<br>
So she pounded herself into hash.

And planning to catch her,<br>
But somebody's hidden my walker!

<h3>Al Willis writes 4/28</h3>
The fur that he left, a chinchilla,<br>
Was meant for his lover, Priscilla.<br>
   Mary Ann thought that she<br>
   Would get it, home-free,<br>
But it was spelled out in the willa.<p>
When she walked on the beach (my girl, Tess),<br>
Her rear showed a lovely excess.<br>
   Her cute bathing suit<br>
   Sent men in pursuit.<br>
It's true that she has a largesse.

When your body decides to expel<br>
Its odours, it makes quite a smell.<br>
Thus a fart's not abusive -<br>
Indeed, it's inclusive<br>
And appreciated by deaf people as well!

There once was a girl from Poughkeepsie<br>
Who sneaked off to bed with a gypsy.<br>
Though normally shy<br>
Restraint passed her by<br>
Because she was ever so tipsy.

Woe is my lovely companion<br>
Whose bottom's as wide as a canyon<br>
She fears it too ample<br>
So she won't let me sample<br>
Her broad and majestic, young Shannon.

This drink to be drunk is what calms<br>
The sightless, old skunk beggin' alms<br>
For now he forgets<br>
All the time he regrets<br>
That he spent with that wench, Rosie Palms

If there's one thing you have surely mastered<br>
It's the talent for getting quite plastered.<br>

A buxom young wench, name of Dusted,<br>

Having breasted most hazards, it busted.

Burned his bum<br>
And turned his shit into butter.

All wrinkled and lazy it lies;<br>
Viagra had caused it to rise.<br>
I thought I would thrill her,<br>
But now I'm a killer<br>
'Cause she just dropped dead from surprise!

She thought right in bed I would hop,<br>
But arthritic bones tend to pop.<br>
Viagra she fed me;<br>
She's ready to bed me.<br>
Could somebody lift me on top?

<p>I'm willing to give up my life<br>
If Viagra can end all this strife.<br>
I'm just an old fart<br>
And have a weak heart,<br>
But place me on top of my wife.

<p>When Clinton and Paula did meet,<br>
He asked her to kneel at his feet.<br>
She said, "You're the Gov.<br>
And I know you need love,<br>
But your meat is too crooked to eat."

She was simultaneously licking,<br>
Some other man's private domain.

She lay on the floor<br>
Crying, "Darlink, more, more!" <br>
"Sorry, sweetheart, it's limsk!"

<h3>Wormdirt <a name="crete1">writes</a> a seven-verse epic 04/20/98</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A voluptuous lady from Crete<br>
Had a cunt that was wide as a street.<br>
While fondling her crack,<br>
A fellow named Jack<br>
Fell in, to the soles of his feet!
<p>
"Oh, Jack," said the lady from Crete,<br>
"You really should be more discreet.<br>
It's too easy to spot<br>
That you're stuck in my twat."<br>
As she said this, she pushed in his feet.

<p>
In the cunt of the lady from Crete,<br>
Jack had almost passed out from the heat.<br>
"She won't hear if I shout,<br>
So I'll <i>gnaw</i> my way out."<br>
And so saying, he started to eat.
<p>
From Jack's chewing, the lady from Crete<br>
Had an orgasmic surge so complete<br>
Jack was carried outside<br>
On her spasming tide. . .<br>
A surfacing diver, replete.
<p>
"Hey, Jack," asked the lady from Crete,<br>
"While inside, did you happen to meet<br>
A biker named Charley?<br>
He can't find his Harley,<br>
Which he parked in my cunt.  What a treat!"
<p>
Jack replied to the lady from Crete,<br>
"I was too busy eating your meat<br>
To check out any guys;<br>
But your cunt has the size<br>
To contain a platoon or a fleet."
<p>
While Jack spoke to the lady from Crete,<br>
From her cunt came a thundering beat,<br>
And the Harley zoomed out.<br>
She said, "I have no doubt<br>
It's just my monthly cycle complete."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "If anyone else wants to continue the adventures of Jack and the lady, please feel free. 
(Rhyming on "Jack" instead of "Crete" would probably be easier."</i>

<h3>Mick Tully writes limograms 04/15/98</h3>
<h4>An odd amalgam of anagrams and the vulgar Limerick</h4>

Our Parliamentary system's the best<br>
Our MPs, they fight on our behest<br>
But they don't cross swords<br>
Within 'The House of Lords'<br>
Because it is the "Household of Rest!"
<p>

You know it really isn't quite fair.<br>
With Betty Boothroyd in that fine chair<br>
She never brooks any argument<br>
Within 'The Houses of Parliament':<br>
When it "often pushes lame hot-air".
<p>

He bullies those weak MPs with flair<br>
They complain hourly that he's not fair<br>
With no preamble<br>
Alistair Campbell?<br>
His response is: I'm a pest? Call Blair!
<p>

The Left has had enough baloney<br>
From Blair and his Mandelson crony<br>
They won't stand any nonsense<br>
At 'The Labour Party Conference'<br>
So, let's: "act clean. Probe "Fuehrer" Tony!"
<p>

How terribly cruel can it get?<br>
The poor cat, it's gone to the vet.<br>
They say the Westminster chat<br>
'bout 'Humphrey the Downing Street Cat?':<br>
Cherie wants mog hurt?  Thy end, pet!

Our politicians, as one they yearn<br>
For awards that they sure think they earn<br>
But I thought I was pissed<br>
When 'The New Year's Honours List':<br>
Anagrammed to: Whose tiny arseholes turn?
<p>

It was a slick slogan quite fair<br>
To re-brand our Country he dare<br>
'Cool Britannia': he boast,<br>
Always beats a "Beef roast".<br>
But the Tories said: "No action, Blair?"
<p>

"The Emperor's New Clothes", they aren't<br>
To be gossiped about or then we can't<br>
    Get the finance to come forth<br>
    For  'The Angel of the North'<br>
Our slick motto?: Ho-Ho! Feel tenth grant!
<p>

They piss-up and wreck many saloons<br>
They're a bunch of gin-sodden goons<br>
When topering at their local pub<br>
'Wasps Rugby Union Football Club':<br>
Are: Foul lusty pub-crawling baboons.
<p>

A Kensington copper, he had to grab<br>
Dennis Wise who was giving it the gab<br>
He staggered from the pub,<br>
Singing: "'Chelsea Football Club?'<br>
It equals: Foul local? He belts cab!"
<p>

A mad Frenchman, he inflicted big dents<br>
On a fan's head when he took some offence<br>
He said: "You must see,<br>
'Manchester United FC':<br>
Anagrams to 'Match intrudes fence!'"
<p>

After spanking a hooligan runt<br>
In that infamous Selhurst Park stunt<br>
Manchester United FC<br>
Took a dim view of his spree<br>
But he objected: "I'm teased: "French c**t!"
<p>

Two directors, their sweaty palms greased<br>
By five million "kit" pounds at least<br>
Bragged: "A new slogan you see<br>
Of: 'Newcastle United FC':<br>
Is the logical: I want c***s fleeced! <br>

The whole world was united in grief<br>
'coz her seat belt, it started to chafe<br>
    Diana Princess of Wales<br>
    Who was in town for the sales<br>
Saying : "Paris? Nice slow and safe!"
<p>

That great concrete post they nearly missed<br>
But speed the driver he would insist<br>
    She didn't know he was on ales    <br>
    For 'Diana Princess of Wales'<br>
Became: Fine car? Alas, now pissed.

<p>

Adept at the sax or harmonica<br>
A good "blow" he tried to offer her<br>
    When 'President William Clinton'<br>
    Showed his instrument to the intern<br>
She said: "Lewd intent sir? Pill, Monica!"<p>
Prince Charles, he is fond of a hike<br>
Then speaking to a TV "mike"<br>
He enjoys his evening strolls <br>
With 'Camilla Parker-Bowles': <br>
Then he likes to "Roll palace's warm bike!"

<p>
Many mouthfuls of jizz she had to spit<br>
On that spotless white Oval Office Carpet<br>
When intern got the washing done<br>
At 'The White House Washington'<br>

<h4>Skirt Trilogy</h4>
She strode like a graceful giraffe<br>
Her long skirt had a slit up one half<br>
Every step that she took<br>
Attracted a look<br>
From the boys as she showed off her calf.

<p>
The next day she wore a hem – high<br>
And the boys, they could all see her thigh<br>
It was much too revealing,<br>
Extremely appealing<br>
They all ogled and let out a sigh.

<p>A day later (now this may seem blunt)<br>
Her short skirt had a slit up the front!<br>
As she walked through the door<br>
They all ogled galore<br>
But she had the skirt on back-to-front!

Many Frenchmen, to avoid the embarrassment<br>
Of what saying "Please kiss it" in Paris meant<br>
Pull it out on a date<br>
In Arkansas State<br>
Where this request is not sexual harrassment!
<p>
In the American version of cricket -<br>
With kneepads, two balls but no wicket,<br>
There's no appeal for "Howzat"<br>
As the man lifts his bat -<br>
Instead you'll hear "kiss it" or "lick it"!

<p>Asked a survey of women, door to door -<br>
"If you had sex with Al Gore, would he score?"<br>
Fifty-two said "No way!<br>
I prefer my sex gay!"<br>
80% said "Who the hell is Al Gore ?"

There once was a kid in my class<br>
Who's balls were made out of brass<br>
When he finally got lay,<br>
He realized he was gay,<br>
And cum shot out of his ass.

A crazy young lawyer apprentice<br>
Had purposely tried to torment us.<br>
He would grab at the hooter<br>
Of the chief prosecutor.<br>
The judge said he's non compos mentis.

Her sister played on her team<br>
They were the best of friends, it would seem<br>
But "sis" finally learned<br>
That when she wanted and yearned<br>
She could borrow her big sis's beam.

I once met his little green man<br>
He was doing this weird thing with his hand<br>
He had it up my girlfriend's dress<br>
Then he screamed "what an awful mess<br>
It's going to take acid to get this stuff off my hand!"

A lascivious lady named Proctor<br>
Was obsessed by the cock of her doctor.<br>
She said, "If we don't screw,<br>
I'll claim harm, and I'll sue."<br>
So the doctor gave in and he foctor.

I know a sweet lady named Brenda<br>
Who had an affair with a blenda<br>
She said "Stir speed is fine<br>
Whip is divine<br>
But it wore the skin off my pudenda!"

Who liked to have sex on the phone<br>

There once was a woman named Flapper.<br>

Moby Dick had a cast-iron prick<br>
And his balls were made of brass<br>
One day they struck in a raging storm<br>
And sparks came out of his ass<p>
<i>Toast Point begs Bulldog to <a href=../../srchfrm.html>search the archives</a> for more limerickal 
renditions of this one.</i>

There was an old man from Brazil<br>
Who one day took the wrong pill<br>
His heart expired<br>
And his ass back-fired<br>
And his balls were blown over the hill...
<p>
There once was an inventor by the name of MacBean<br>
Who invented, of all things, a wanking machine<br>
But on the 99th stroke<br>
The bloody thing broke<br>
And you should've heard him scream...
