<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/29/98</h3>
An exotic young dancer named Fran<br>
Performed her nude dance with a fan.<br>
One evening she tripped.<br>
As she did, her fan slipped<br>
So the cops hauled her off to the can.

<h3><a href=mailto:KAZ1K@aol.com>Raceway</a> writes 07/29/98</h3>
Ken Starr is so free with our money<br>
To prove Bill was into strange cunny.<br>
"So who gives a shit,<br>
You big hypocrite,<br>
That his dick's always reeking of tunny?"

<p>I once knew these twins Siamese<br>
Who were always quite easy to please<br>
For I have two cocks<br>
And quadruple rocks....<br>
They said I was just the bee's knees!

<p>I dated some twins, one named Dinah<br>
The other was called Evelina...<br>
Conjoined at the clit<br>
They cared not a whit...<br>
'Twas up to me, either vagina.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "You need another bullet under "Did you write this limerick yourself?"  
i.e.  "Sharing a classic that I wrote myself.""</i>
<p>
<i>Ha!  If poets could declare their own works as classic, we'd be hip deep in 'em.</i>
<p>
On politics I've no agenda...<br>
And if Bill screws Annette and then Brenda,<br>
Good Luck to Ken Starr,<br>
Our ethical czar,<br>
In sniffing out straying pudenda.

<p>
"Old Man," she said rather cheekily,<br>
"Your pelvis is grinding quite creakily,"<br>
With one final shove,<br>
In her tunnel of love,<br>
He managed to come, although leakily.

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>Friar</a> writes 07/29/98</h3>
There once were three lawyers from Slough<br>
Howard, Allan then Andy (and now)<br>
They sure made a fine trio<br>
Like an orgy in Rio<br>
How'ard Dewey, All' Screwum And' Howe!

If there's one thing that I like to do<br>
It's to ogle the girls in the loo.<br>
I peek through the transom<br>
At buttocks quite handsome,<br>
As it always enhances the view.

My lover, while mounting me, slipped<br>
And then that mean bastard, he quipped:<br>
"It's all your own fault!<br>
That roomy old vault!<br>
What I'd give for a pussy that gripped!"
<p>
I thought, when he spoke of "male bonding"<br>
Platonically he was responding,<br>
But it seems I was wrong,<br>
The urge was too strong,<br>
For he took up male mutual fondling.

<p>Would Clinton submit to castration?<br>
I ask for the good of the Nation!<br>
With his balls down the potty,<br>
He'd less likely be naughty,<br>
And the White House could use some aeration.

<p>"My Heart Will Go On" - Well, on what?<br>
Just how could you fall for such smut?<br>
With her tits all a-jiggle<br>
And her pussy a-wriggle,<br>
She's such a lascivious slut!

<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The best part is right in the middle<br>
Said a spinster named Old Lady Biddle.<br>
"With a mirror in hand<br>
You can find the right gland,<br>
And give it a jolly good twiddle!"

<p>Just how many times must I tell you?<br>
Get your sorry ass out of my igloo!<br>
Your bestial ways<br>
With polar bear strays,<br>
Is more than I'll ever get into.

<p>Just how many times must I tell you?<br>
I've never laid hands on your cockatoo!<br>
I rarely do pets,<br>
Not even on bets,<br>
And I've never had sex with your emu!

<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I always leave carrots 'til last<br>
The best of a lustful repast!<br>
Those tubers so trim<br>
Fit right up my quim,<br>
And always provide quite a blast.

<p>She screamed as he opened the door<br>
That larcenous, thieving young whore.<br>
"You took all my money!<br>
Showed none of your cunny!"<br>
He said as he settled the score.

<p>Let's meet at this out-of-town diner<br>
It's owned by this grizzled old miner...<br>
He's a little bit weird,<br>
But don't be a-feared<br>
If he asks for a used panty-liner.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Inspired by one of Letterman's recent Top Ten.....Things Not to Say in Victoria's Secret........"Just sniffing.""</i>
<p>I'm not superstitious, but then...<br>
When the nurse said to pee once again,<br>
I gave her the cup<br>
That I would fill up,<br>
And told her to clearly say "When".

<p>
I once owned a pig that could fly<br>
But simply would not multiply.<br>
"What good is that trick<br>
When the sows are heart-sick?<br>
Come down!  You've got furrows to ply!"

<p>Never again shall I hunt<br>
With arrows so hopelessly blunt!<br>
I aimed for the heart<br>
Of that fickle young tart!"<br>
Said Cupid who hated the cunt.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Can't get into your first lines to add quotes......."</i>
<p>Oysters are sometimes delicious<br>
Sculpted in form most auspicious,<br>
Reminiscent of twat,<br>
They get you all hot<br>
To try something pink and lubricious.

<p>I rubbed up this powerful genie<br>
Taking care to avoid his green weenie....<br>
But touch it I did<br>
And he blew his lid,<br>
Now mine's disappeared, that big meanie!

A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>
Had a weakness for underage teens.<br>
His plea of bad vision<br>
Brought jury derision,<br>
Now he's dining on prison cuisines.

<h3><a href=mailto:Bktep@aol.com>Bluebird</a> shares a classic 07/28/98</h3>
A couple named Tom and Louise<br>
Did a vaudeville act on their knees.<br>
 They would crawl down the aisle<br>
As they fucked doggie-style,<br>
While the orchestra played Kilmer's "Trees."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a variation of a limerick that was posted here in Nov. 1997.     "</i>

<h3>Gearhart & H write 7/28</h3>
A skanky old whore from Lake Placid<br>
Had titties gangrenous and flaccid.<br>
When she spread her thighs<br>
The smell would kill flies.<br>
It made your eyes burn just like acid.
<p>
<i>H comments: Eric: just trying to surpass "Green Meat" (a lofty goal, indeed!)</i>

<h3>Hub writes 07/27/98</h3>
I once had a beer named Key<br>
Who constantly made me pee<br>
He went for a ride <br>
Made me upchuck inside<br>
Man did he taste shitty.

Viagra, the little blue pill<br>
"A Godsend," said Hillary to Bill.<br>
"'Cuz now after your tricks<br>
With those intern-type chicks,<br>
You're able my pussy to fill!"

<h3>Marty writes 07/26/98</h3>
Let's meet at this out-of-town diner<br>
My husband can be such a whiner.<br>
Who wants to listen<br>
To his ol' pissin'<br>
Because I have found someone finer?
<p>
A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>
Peered out at the neighborhood scenes<br>
He put on his glasses<br>
To check out the lasses<br>
Said, "I'll have the one in blue jeans!"

<p>
Would Clinton submit to castration?<br>
It surely would cause a sensation.<br>
A ruler without balls?<br>
To women this calls<br>
For a major, big celebration.

<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Viagra, the little blue pill<br>
Reputed to give men a thrill<br>
My Charlie took it.<br>
He cried, "Hey, look-it!"<br>
He sits there admiring it -- STILL!

<p>I thought, when he spoke of "male bonding"<br>
He meant he would be responding<br>
To his inner child.<br>
Instead he went wild:<br>
Stuck his male bits in a Porn Queen.

<p>"Oh, father! I have a confession!<br>
Sex has become my obsession!"<br>
"Let's see just how bad<br>
You've got it, my lad!"<br>
Father coaxed him into undression!

<p>My lover, while mounting me, slipped<br>
And into the wrong hole he dipped<br>
"Wow, I like this space!<br>
Let me mark my place.<br>
It'll be better when you are stripped!"

<p>I rubbed up this powerful genie<br>
Who simpered and said "Oh, you meanie!<br>
Don't call me at this hour.<br>
I was in the shower!<br>
Your rubbing me is quite unseemly."

<p>She screamed as he opened the door<br>
Just as her pink robe hit the floor.<br>
"You cannot come in!<br>
My slip is too thin.<br>
I can't let you see any more!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Actually, my Mom wrote this one."</i>

"It's dead, Jim," said Dr. McCoy.<br>
"Its beauty was for all to enjoy.<br>
At the inquiry I'll back you,<br>
That butterfly did attack you,<br>
But next time use STUN not DESTROY."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It's not really naughty but should be included here because of the extreme violence."</i>
<p>
"It's dead, Jim," said Dr. McCoy.<br>
"We're out of the plutonium fuel alloy.<br>
So as long as we're stopping,<br>
Let's you and me go shopping.<br>
You need a new pajama top, my boy."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It's not naughty either but should be included here because of the 
adult theme. "</i>

"It's dead, Jim," said Dr. McCoy.<br>
"So lifeless and useless, your toy.<br>
I'll find where my bag is,<br>
And beam down Viagras<br>
And that cute Klingon messenger boy."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Maybe Star Trek should have its own category. "</i>

<i>David W. Neylon suggested the minor scansion cleanup that turned this limerick into a

Oh, father!  I have a confession!<br>
A naughty and sinful transgression!<br>
I fondled myself <br>
With a delf little elf,<br>
And now he's become an obsession!
<hr>
<h3>Puff Adder writes 7/26</h3>
There once was a General named Trout<br>
Who with his army did storm a redoubt<br>
They battered down doors<br>
And found only whores<br>
So they went in and they never came out.
<p>
The enemy leader was mad at 'em<br>
He thought that he really had 'em<br>
It was a crude trap<br>
The whores had the clap<br>
This was the vaunted germ warfare of Saddam.
<p>
Now clap is not known for killin'<br>
The whores were all quite willin'<br>
To avoid rejection<br>
They took an injection<br>
Because the medics had penicillin.

A Scot from the Valley of Clyde<br>
Proclaimed to the world with great pride:<br>

 And incredibly strong<br>
Six pigeons can perch side by side."

<p>

 "My dear, at the grape you've been nipping.<br>
  Your vision has just gone a-tripping.<br>
          The truth is, my pet,<br>
          Only three birds can set,<br>
  Ant that third one, his foot keeps on slipping."

<h3><a href=mailto:farda@rotfl.com>Tom Morrow</a> writes 07/24/98</h3>

Wherever she sat,<br>
There was odor of scat,<br>
I, punster, call her "Undeterred."

<h3>Friar writes 07/24/98</h3>

As her suitors would ream,<br>
'Cause her pussy's a real four-alarmer.

The black man said, "White I require.<br>
And make me uptight<br>
And quite out of sight."<br>
Then, POOF!  He's a Tampon!  Hellfire!

<i>The poet comments, "Based on a very old joke."</i>
<p>

We admire the great Charlton Heston.<br>
On a talk show, the bugger was guestin'.<br>
   "Please allow me, perchance.."<br>
    Then he reached in his pants<br>
And he pulled out his big Smith & Wesson.

<h3>Bill shares a classic 07/20/98</h3>
A pretty young lady named Vogel<br>
Once sat herself down on a molehill.<br>
A curious mole<br>
Nosed into her hole --<br>
Ms. Vogel's ok, but the mole's ill.

Slick Willie was just there today!

<h3>Big Bob writes 07/20/98</h3>

Eight weeks and he's still writing shit<br>
But his new shortened name<br>
Will not strain his brain<br>
Maybe he can focus on developing a wit.
<p>
I wonder where Lassie's Lover has gone<br>
Lassie's bitching that shes getting none<br>
With Balto away<br>
And no sign of a stray<br>
She's even checked to see if the cat has a dong!

<h3>Marty writes 07/18/98</h3>
He claimed to be up for a lay.<br>
He wanted to roll in the hay.<br>
Take 'er or leave 'er.<br>
I've got hay fever.<br>
My eyes are swelled shut today.
<p>
He shouted, "I've got an erection!"<br>
She mumbled, "I've got an infection.<br>
If you wanna trade<br>
Then you can get laid."<br>
Funny -- he settled for affection.

Met an innocent young girl in late fall.<br>

The best part is right in the middle<br>
Of my cello, my big fucking fiddle<br>
In the dark center hole<br>
Lives a small midget ho<br>
Who'll suck while you whittle a little.
<p>
I rubbed up this powerful genie<br>
While fucking my little dog queenie<br>
While pulling his pecker<br>
I summoned a spectre<br>
Three wishes..for sucking a weenie!!

<p>
<i>The poet comments,<br>
"To some folks who'll probably be sick<br>
At the thought of thick doggie
dick.<br>
Just think of the gain<br>
Be a friend, be humane. <br>
For three wishes you'll be trying this trick."</i>
<p>
<i>Well, obviously, you and Lassie's Lover should hook up.</i>
<p>
Never again shall I hunt<br>
For a word that rhymes well with cunt<br>
While this limerick be strange<br>
And a wee bit deranged<br>
It's a hell of a publicity stunt.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Whatcha expect from a guy named Deep-Goat?"</i>
<p>
Would Clinton submit to castration?<br>
What a question, it needs concentration!<br>
On the one hand his wife<br>
On the other a knife<br>
Say goodbye to the balls of our nation.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'd like to thank all the little people...who made porn."</i>
<p>I always leave carrots 'til last<br>
Merely etiquette I learned in my past<br>
Wure I like them all right<br>
But it's a horrible sight<br>
When grandma pulls them out of her ass.

<h3><a href=mailto:highc@uamont.edu>Deep-Goat</a> writes 07/17/98</h3>
Would Clinton submit to castration?<br>
If he thought it an island vacation<br>
The bastard's so dumb<br>
He'd gladly go numb<br>
For a free trip to the new Cuban Nation.

<i>The poet comments, "I just can't see Clinton getting along with someone whose name is so
close to Fidelity."</i>

"My Heart Will Go On" - Well, on what?<br>
A song of a fag and a slut<br>
While that big boat was sinking<br>
I couldn't help to be thinking<br>
That this movie is numbing my butt.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'll bet my butt was number than theirs, even in the freezing water."</i>
<p>Viagra, the little blue pill<br>
When swallowed will give men a thrill<br>
Big deal, so will I<br>
Just suck till I'm dry<br>
And avoid paying the medical bill.

The outhouse on my grampa's farm<br>

Re "felch"<br>
Only if it strikes your fancy, please ask around Frisco for me and find
the most widely used terms for:<br>
1. Vaginal insertion of live animals in general, or specific animals in
particular.<br>
2. Anything else unusual that people and/or animals include in their sex
acts that has a concise catchy term like felch.

<i>Toast Point lives in New York, not Frisco, but we have our own proclivities here.  
"Felching", to Toast Point, refers to the practice of sucking ejaculate from the

live animals, Toast Point doesn't know of a specific term for it.  However, he is

It used enough coal to heat Nome.

<h4>by Phil Cannibal</h4>
A snatch-licking fellow named Phlugge,       <br>
Tried licking while high on a drug.          <br>
He complained it was dry.         <br>
Said his girl, "I know why--      <br>
You bastard, you're licking the rug!"        
<p>
<h4>by Jim Menger</h4>
A delinquent with dyslexia severe,<br>
Scrawled graffiti on walls far and near,     <br>
Such as "Sick my duck,"<br>
And also "Fou Yuck"    <br>
Plus other scrawls equally queer.

There was a Levine from New York, <br>
Who loved ham and sausage and pork.          <br>
He knew that he shouldn't,        <br>
But quit it, he couldn't,         <br>
So he changed his last named to O'Rourke.    
<p>
<h4>by Aurdry Conklin</h4>
There was a young lady named Heather,        <br>
Who golfed in all kinds of weather.          <br>
She teed off one morn, <br>
In an electrical storm,<br>
Now they're trying to put Heather together.  
<p>
<h4>by Con Moore</h4>
At the sperm bank, turnout was light,        <br>
So the manager said, "This ain't right!      <br>
We'll run ads on TV    <br>
And these peckers can see         <br>
Our new slot for deposits at night."
