It's OK to tweak it a bit, but not very much...</i>

Sam Pittman submits a request:<br>
<i>I am trying to locate a Robert Service parody with the lines   1. "When he
laid it on the bar they say it stretched from thar to thar" and 2. "There on
the floor with his ass hole tore lied Dangerous Dan McGrew"

I also would like to find a poem with the last line "Which explains the hump
on the camel and the sphinx's inscrutable smile."</i>

<h3>Tudor shares a classic 02/28/98</h3>
There once was a young man from Kent<br>
Whose dick was so long that it bent<br>
So just to be nice,<br>
He folded it twice<br>
And instead of cumming, he went!
<hr>
<h3>Arbuckle writes 02/28/98</h3>

He was hard again to perfection!

<h3>Mike M. writes 02/27/98</h3>
I don't understand this stink<br>
Of Monica and the President's dink.<br>
It's all very silly...<br>
Like Milli-Vanilli,<br>
All that she did was lip-sync!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Or is that lip-SINK?"</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I can give any girl<br>
An unforgettable whirl.<br>
It's not that I'm hung,<br>
It's more that my tongue<br>
Is 12 inches long when unfurled!

A gay lost his boots in a game...<br>
And his shirt, and his pants, but no shame -<br>
Was it poker? No way!<br>
That's no game for a gay.<br>
He played "poke 'im". To lose was his aim!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
With two assholes; vaginas galore....<br>
In assembly-line fashion<br>

With her other mouth, she'd call for more!

<h3>Steve writes 02/25/98</h3>
Met a guy, cute but quite dumb,<br>

For a whole 69,<br>
We could 68, and I'll owe you one!"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I thought it would be kinda fun<br>
To put my dick in a hotdog bun<br>
With mustard and chili,<br>
But that burned my willy,<br>
And blistered my poor girlfriend's tongue!

<h3>Oral-B writes 02/24/98</h3>

I met her in Athens (that's Greece).<br>
She could talk and she never would cease.<br>
It was talk all the time,<br>
But the sex was sublime.<br>
She's a nice conversational piece!

<h3><a href=mailto:aabbabob@aol.com>Sam Pittman</a> writes 02/24/98</h3>

Thought his dick might be a repeater<br>

Or t'would sully her dress<br>
That way it kept history neater!

What you see's what you get, I suppose<br>
It's just like the Emperor's new clothes<br>

No meter, no rhyme<br>

<hr><h3>Possum writes 02/24/98</h3>
You may think my story is bunk,<br>
But I knew a horny young punk<br>
Who cut off his thing<br>
And had it replaced<br>
With a full grown elephant's trunk!!
<p>
This guy with an elephant's trunk,<br>
He got more girls than most hunks.<br>
But it wasn't all good;<br>
Occasionally it would<br>
Try hard to feed him his nuts!
<p>
<i>Thing/replaced?  I don't think so...</i>
<hr>
<h3>Blowcephus writes 02/24/98</h3>
A lonely young fellow named Jim<br>
Couldn't get girls to have sex with him;<br>
Although his dong<br>
Was twelve inches long,<br>
5/8 inch wide is too slim!
<p>
Although my dick isn't little,<br>
It has quite a curve in the middle.<br>
It's so hard to screw,<br>
And jerk it off, too,<br>
And I miss the bowl when I piddle!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:skink2@juno.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 02/23/98</h3>
These days Ronald Reagan's as vague,<br>
Of world affairs as a softboiled egg.<br>
Now the most fun he gets,<br>
Is when one of Nancy's pets<br>
Jumps up and humps on his leg!

<h3>Two hot girls from Butler writes 02/21/98</h3>
As I was walking down the road one day<br>
I stopped at a whorehouse on the way<br>
I told her all I had was a penny<br>
She said , "That won't get you any!"<br>
So by myself I had to play!

The mayor and cops were parading,<br>
The horses and bands, captivating.<br>

And folks nearly dropped dead,<br>
When the horses began defecating.

I don't blame you if you want to shout<br>
That you have a great big waterspout.<br>
But keep it indoors,<br>
Or in sophomores,<br>
And, in public, don't let it hang out!
<hr>
<h3>Jimbo writes 02/19/98</h3>

This thing about Toast Point and Wumpus<br>
Back here it is causing a rumpus<br>
If it’s only one day<br>
That they frolic and play<br>
I think Toast Point will need a new compass!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Or am I missing the point(s) altogether?"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast always points north, did you know that?</i>
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 02/19/98</h3>
Hooray for that dude named Friar<br>
Of women he's surely no liar<br>
No logic or sense<br>
Do their mouths dispense<br>
The intelligence of men is much higher!

<i>Toast Point reminds all womenfolk that <b>he's</b> not writing these things...</i>

<h3>Loretta F. writes 02/19/98</h3>
I'd like a apply for a blow-job,<br>
A position  with a well-hung young jock,<br>
A lost Male sorter,<br>
An atheletic supporter,<br>
Or a weiner-cleaner down at the cock shop!
<p>
I wish that I had a nickel<br>
For every time someone gets tickled<br>
At the really queer<br>
Names they hear<br>
Like Dick Butkus or Dick Trickle!
<p>
A hillbilly from Mississippi<br>
Married a horny young hippie.<br>

A pervy young fellow named Claude<br>
Often fell down and crawled<br>
On hands and knees<br>
In order to please<br>
The kind of head that's always bald.

Searched with a fine-toothed comb<br>
All over the south<br>

There was a young lady from Ft. Lee,<br>

Now the Nantucket man's in his tomb!

Sounds if  Wumpus isn't a slouch or a dunce<br>
But the demurral from Toast Point  affronts.<br>
Says he, "can't repeat"<br>
His final Valentine treat -<br>
But we'll listen if told us just once !

That when she exploded,<br>
It ended their sleazy affair.

It was sad, when she shuttered the blind.<br>
If you ask me, I'd call this unkind.<br>
But I quickly spied<br>
The great divide<br>
And a milky and zoftig behind.
<p>
This rhyme is not meant to be smutty,<br>
And nor is it meant to be rutty.<br>

And my mouth tastes so funny<br>
And besides that, it's ruining my knees!"

Said Monica, feeling quite chipper<br>

The Prez says that he didn't do it<br>

Is too hot to handle<br>
And it sure looks like Monica blew it!

(No, not his own, but Chad's!)<br>
Which made the women laugh and run.

Disposable condoms? Not me!<br>
'Cause I never know what I need.<br>
They're handy in the car<br>
When you're driving real far<br>
And you can't afford to stop and go pee!<p>

She licked my cock quite sore<br>
She tried charging me triple.<br>
In her hair I did dribble - <br>
Then I stiffed her and showed her the door!<p>

Carried condoms like you've never seen.<br>
Broad stripes and clan plaids,<br>
Bright stars and Ye Gads!<br>
A paisley in three shades of green.
<p>
<h4>by Charles Crockford </h4>
There was a nude baker named Hyde,<br>
With a shop by the water's high tide.<br>
The sun was so strong<br>
Before very long,<br>
His buns were all burnt on one side.
<p>
<h4>by A. N. Wilkins </h4>
Although Hemingway talked a good line,<br>
His biographers mostly opine<br>
That with all his pride,<br>
He'd have been satisfied<br>
To be virile as friend Gertrude Stein.
<p>
<h4>by Don Moore </h4>
A cowboy from Texas named Rick<br>
Round the fire never did care a lick,<br>
For a bunch of tall tales;<br>
Of girls, gunfights, and jails;<br>
He just poked at the coals with his dick.
<p>
<h4>by Lucas Hulp </h4>
A well-endowed woman named Claire<br>
Owns that orchard of fruit trees right there.<br>
Now, I've seen the picked fruit<br>
And you just can't dispute<br>
That she really does have a nice pear.
<p>
<h4>by James M. Menger </h4>
He offered her pleasure sublime,<br>
With twelve inches of penis divine.<br>
She lay back on the table,<br>
Said, "Let's see if you're able."<br>
So he gave her three inches, four times.
<p>
<h4>by Don Moore </h4>
With old Elvis in Graceland, I am, sir,<br>
Where his cars and his drugs by the dram were.<br>
It was here he was married.<br>
It was here he was buried--<br>
But in the back yard like a hamster.
<p>
<h4>by Frank Ward </h4>
A straight-laced old spinster named Beecher<br>
Became a biology teacher.<br>
She taught lads and lasses,<br>
Their heads from their asses,<br>
And this was an important feature.
<p>
<h4>by Frank Ward </h4>
My Granddad of earlier days<br>
Spent his life on a corn whiskey craze.<br>
Thoughts of burial he hated,<br>
So we had him cremated.<br>
It took three days to put out the blaze.
<p>
<h4>by Theo Heller </h4>
"Hillary," said her Doc, "Who've you hugged?<br>
You've got crabs." But Hillary shrugged,<br>
And said, "I'll just tell Bill<br>
I have what made Nixon ill.<br>
It seems the Oval Office is bugged."
<p>
<h4>by Mark Levy</h4><br>
Marge bought a used dildo one day,<br>
From Sister Annette, who was gay.<br>
It had ninety notches,<br>
And smelled of nun's crotches,<br>
And would turn itself on when you'd pray.
<p>
<h4>from New Orleansite</h4>
A rabbi is now quite a hero.<br>
He fiddled around just like Nero,<br>
And jumped like a rabbit<br>
Beneath a nun's habit.<br>
And now she's a Mother Shapiro.
