<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/31/98</h3>
A writer of poems, to succeed,<br>
Must listen to Arthur x-eeD.<br>
The words, all in rhyme,<br>
And the meter, sublime,<br>
But the past tense of piss must be peed.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Does everyone know that Arthur Deex is editor at Pentatette?"</i>
<p>
When they swim across that Rio Grand-de,<br>
I usually take a firm stand, see?<br>
I also hate boaters<br>
When they have no quotas,<br>
Unless some of the girls are quite randy!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The monthly theme at Pentatete was "Illegals.""</i>

Viagra may be just a dream<br>
For giving your pecker some steam.<br>
     It's now been reported<br>
      Your vision's distorted:<br>
Things aren't as large as they seem!

A fellow with love-making flair<br>
Was licking his sweetie "down there".<br>
When a small puff of gas<br>
Was expelled from her ass,<br>
He cried, "Ah, that's a breath of fresh air!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a limericked version of an old joke.

An athletic young man from Woonsocket<br>
Caught his balls in his bicycle sprocket<br>

What once was more valued than gold<br>
Lay shriveled and useless and old,<br>
But a blue little pill<br>
Has caused it to fill.<br>
When I poke 'er I hope I won't fold.

Viagra's more valued than gold<br>
And helps me at cards so I'm told.<br>
Strip poker I play<br>
And no longer say<br>
I have to limp out 'cause I fold.

<h3>Dave the Knave shares a classic 05/25/98</h3>
Said the clerk, as the vicar withdrew<br>
"I shouldn't say this, but I do -<br>
The bishop is slicker<br>
And quicker and thicker<br>
And three inches longer than you!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "this came from the same guy who gave me the green meat one. he is dead now."</i>
<p>
<i>How sad.  This one is one of Toast Point's faves.  Let's see if he can remember the other one...<p>
At night, from the apse at St. Giles<br>
Came a scream that resounded for miles<br>
Rector said, "Oh, my gracious,<br>
Good Brother Ignatius<br>
Forgets that the bishop has piles!"</i>

<h3>Friar writes 05/24/98</h3>
My dreams, I'm inclined to forget<br>
As most people do, I can bet<br>
I recall just a few<br>
Say, a hundred or two<br>
Cause they are the ones that were wet.
<p>
A photographer known as McRammiter<br>
Had a dick with a ten inch diameter<br>
Said "I only shoot girls<br>
With diamonds and pearls<br>
And as long as they have a wide aperture!"
<hr>
<h3>Big Bob writes 05/24/98</h3>
The Friar's thunder I'm afraid I must rob<br>
I didn't know who'd used my name on the job<br>
But if my name you must use<br>
to try to get screws<br>
At least give the girl the full cob!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Try not to shoot yourself in the foot"</i>
<p>
You see, the Friar, the man who does scoff<br>
Is, in theory, a man of the cloth<br>
But this is so his toys<br>
He can use on young boys<br>
With a woman he just can't get it off.

<hr>
<h3>Dave the Knave shares a classic 05/24/98</h3>
There was a young fellow named Hardin<br>
Who was blown by his girl in the garden<br>
When asked by the bum<br>
What she'd done with the cum<br>
She replied "Gulp - beg pardon?"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "you banned my green meat one, damn you."</i>

Big Bob and his boyfriend, named Abel,<br>
Went cruising one day in a stable.<br>
A stud of a horse<br>
Fucked his ass with such force<br>
That his bowels blew out of his navel!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Shall we dance, BB?"</i>
<p>
Perhaps you’ve not played with young llamas<br>
Clad loosely in black silk pajamas.<br>
A tight Viet Cong<br>
Backing into your dong:<br>
The ultimate war flashback drama.

<i>The poet comments, "Thanx 2 L's L for the inspiration."</i>

There once was a girl from Mt. Grunt<br>
Who papered her twat back to front.<br>
Said her beau from Mt. Grabbit,<br>
"Please re-verse this habit.<br>
I’m ill with the taste of your cunt."

A randy topologist, Boris,<br>
Seduced a young virgin named Doris.<br>
He increased her genus<br>
By thrusting his penis -<br>
Her maidenhead’s plane’s now a torus.

<h3>and also submits the following:</h3>
<h4>A dialogue between Irish and me via the alt.jokes.limericks NG</h4>
A lady who hails from Krakow,<br>
Loves sailors her furrow to plow.<br>
A magnum of D.P.<br>
Is what she longs to be,<br>
So she can be banged ‘cross the bow.<br>
<i>- Irish -- Slainte!</i>
<p>
A stowaway to ports remote,<br>
Tried to screw all the sailors afloat.<br>
They dispensed with foreplay,<br>
Stuck her on the forestay -<br>
Now she’s bummy-fucked by the whole boat.<br>
<i>- H -- Slante Va!</i>
<p>
The stowaway’s appetite’s whetted<br>
For parties both sordid and fetid.<br>
She commenced in to friggin’<br>
Up high in the riggin’.<br>
Some say she was well tarred and feted.<br>
<i>- Irish -- Scuba Sea! (sic)</i>
<p>
Fifty-one dibbled their nib,<br>
Then left her curled up in a jib.<br>
Said tar fifty-two,<br>
“I’ll eat out the spoo -<br>
I could use this sail for a bib!”<br>
<i>- H -- Spooba Tea! (I know - really sic, sic, sic)<br></i>
<p>
This lass has had some kinda trip.<br>
Swallowing se(a)men is not just a quip:<br>
When the ship struck a reef,<br>
It caused her no grief;<br>
She simply went down on the ship.<br>
<i>- Irish -- just a wee dochan dorus before we gang awa' (or maybe not)<br></i>
<p>
The boat was rent clear thro’ the middle,<br>
And going down like an iron griddle.<br>
No time for a suck!<br>
Less time for a fuck!<br>
Perhaps she could get one last diddle...<br>
<p>
The Cook said “My crank’s name is Fook.”<br>
She said “You know Doris, my nook.<br>
I know you’ve one hand<br>
But perhaps my good man<br>
D. could ride on your lovely white hook.”<br>
<p>
His ivory prosthetic paw<br>
(With old Boston Pier in scrimshaw)<br>
He took to her G<br>
And sang “Mates, look at me!<br>
It’s a wee dock in Doris, that’s a’”<br>

My heart will go on - well, on what?<br>
Maybe a buffet with my butt!<br>
I'll sprinkle my spleen on the table<br>
Whoever is willing and able<br>
Can savor the sauce of my guts!

<i>The poet comments, "Tasty even if a little foul."</i>

Cause sometimes it gives me bad gas.

While I'm walking in the front<br>
A drunk man behind me<br>
Rather trigger happy<br>
Shot me in the arse to be blunt.

There once was a gal named Lewinsky<br>
Who played on a flute like Stravinsky<br>
'Twas "Hail to the Chief"<br>
on this flute made of beef<br>
that stole the front page from Kaczynski.
<p>
Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. Lewinsky<br>
We don't want to leave clues like Kaczynski, <br>
Since you look such a mess,<br>
use the hem of your dress<br>
And wipe all that stuff off your chinsky.
<p>
Lewinsky and Clinton have shown<br>
what Kaczynski must surely have known:<br>
that an intern is better<br>
than a bomb in a letter<br>
given the choice to be blown.

<h3>Muldune shares a classic 05/01/98</h3>
There once was a gal named Lewinsky<br>
Who played on a flute like Stravinsky<br>
'Twas "Hail to the Chief"<br>
 On this flute made of beef<br>
That stole the front page from Kaczynski.

<p>
Said Bill Clinton to young Ms. Lewinsky<br>
 We don't want to leave clues like Kaczynski,<br>
Since you look such a mess,<br>
 Use the hem of your dress<br>
And wipe that stuff off of your chinsky.
<p>
 Lewinsky and Clinton have shown<br>
 What Kaczynski must surely have known:<br>
That an intern is better<br>
 Than a bomb in a letter<br>
Given the choice to be blown.
<p>
 There was a young girl called Lewinsky,<br>
 Who caused as much stir as Kaczynski<br>
When on Kenneth Starr's lap<br>
 She confided, when trapped,<br>
"Bill Clinton is hung like Nijinsky."
