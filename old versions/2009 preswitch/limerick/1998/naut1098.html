There once was a man from Brookshire<br>
In bed, his wife was always tire'<br>
He got him a wench<br>
He's now much less tense<br>
Now when he's pissin', it's like fire.

<h3><a href=mailto:mjkadel@ece.ucdavis.edu>MJK</a> writes 10/29/98</h3>
There once was a Duchess of York,<br>
Who liked to get off with a fork.<br>
She'd fork every day,<br>
In her hot Duchess way,<br>
Until she discovered the spork.

There was a President named Billy<br>
Who thought Starr's report was just silly<br>
But now he ain't laughin'<br>
Never thought it would happen<br>
We're gonna kick his ass off Capital Hill-y.
<p>

I met a young lass using E-mail<br>
I certainly thought she was female<br>
We had cyber sex<br>
But me she did vex<br>
'Cause it turned out the lass was a she-male!
<p>
There was an old space man named Glenn<br>
Who thought he might do it again - <br>
So he hopped on a rocket<br>
'Cause the one in his pocket<br>
Was too old to commit the original sin!

<h3>John Chastaine writes 10/28/98</h3>
So what if John Glenn's on a Space Trip.<br>
I gather his science chores aren't too hip.<br>
In fact I heard the old butthole<br>
Is going up in the shuttle,<br>
To test out "Depends" and "Polygrip"!

<h3>ClaraBlue writes 10/24/98</h3>
There once was a man in a pumpkin<br>
Who had nothing to take a dump in<br>
So he carved a nice crack <br>
Now he calls his house, "Jack"<br>
And his neighbors all call him "Bumpkin".
<p>
The man took a wife in the pumpkin<br>
And she became known as his rump kin<br>
Because they would rut<br>
In just one place, but<br>
He still called her his cuntry bumpkin.
<hr>
<h3>Curly Hare writes 10/24/98</h3>
The Rabbi Jeremiah C. Keller<br>
Kept his underwear locked in a cellar<br>
'Cause slinky pink briefs<br>
With kinky motifs<br>
Aren't kosher or cool on a fella.

<h3><a href=mailto:crzylgs7@yahoo.com>Crazy Legs</a> shares a classic 10/22/98</h3>
Ms. Lewinsky, according to Starr,  <br>
For a phallus, used Clinton’s cigar.  <br>
Now to most common folk<br>
It seems that the bloke<br>
Has been probing the matter too far.

There once was a harlot named Suzie<br>
Who often got drunken and woozy.<br>
She worked on the streets<br>
Lots of men she would meet<br>
Now wouldn't you say she's a floozy?


<hr>
<h3>AE! shares a classic 10/22/98</h3>
A pretty young lady from Wooster<br>
Dreamt that a man had seduced her<br>
She woke with a scare<br>
To find no one there<br>
For a bump in the mattress had goosed her.

<h3>AE! writes 10/22/98</h3>
A bue-eyed man named Shawn<br>
In bed could go on and on<br>

A comely young maiden of yore<br>
Loved to roll with the knights on the floor<br>
Quoth the randy young charmer,<br>
"Please sirs, doff your armor<br>
It makes my poor thingies quite sore!"

<h3>Losh shares a classic 10/19/98</h3>
There once was a man from Montana<br>
With a cock like a ten-inch banana<br>
He bored monstrous holes<br>
In telegraph poles <br>
And thrust in his giant banana.

<h3>Bic writes 10/19/98</h3>

And cut off her swollen left tit.

<h3><a href=mailto:vpwhiz@aol.com>Cleethorpe's Kid</a> shares a classic
10/18/98</h3>
There was a young man from Goole,<br>
Who found a red ring round his tool, <br>
He went to a clinic, <br>
And was told by a cynic, <br>
"Wash it off - it's lipstick you fool!

<h3>More Epics by H, 10/17</h3>

<h4>Captain H's Log, stardate 145896.7</h4>

The moon that I surveyed last week<br>
Had little pig creatures that speak.<br>
They led me to shrines,<br>
Through fields sewn with mines,<br>
And let me at rituals peek.
<p>
‘Bout ten virgin pig-thingys sat<br>
On lingae, each big as a bat.<br>
Each blue steely tower<br>
Had black holes for power.<br>
And then my young rookie crew shat,
<p>
For dildoes proceeded to spin<br>
And plunge and gyrate deep within<br>
And vibrate so hard<br>
The smell of burnt lard<br>
Soon sickened them, as did the din.
<p>
Such terrible cruel sacrifice!!<br>
Then each massive evil device<br>
Exploded with lasers<br>
That chopped ‘em like razors,<br>
Leaving all crispy and diced.
<p>
The priestess, who called herself Xarbs,<br>
Confirmed (as we cleaned up our garbs):<br>
These dildoes of doom<br>
(As you may assume)<br>
Are known as the Pork Cube-B-Barbs.

<p>

<h4>The True Cause of Male Pattern Baldness</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Image: Gold Star!" align="right">
Some insight from Friday night’s feats:<br>
(Why hair ‘round my pate still depletes.)<br>
Testosterone? No.<br>
It’s from a good blow.<br>
And scooting, back arched, ‘cross the sheets.
<p>
<h4>Moose Pants?</h4>
“Dear waiter, my mousse has a fly!”<br>
“Great God, are those moose pants I spy?”<br>
“Not ungulate, *truffle*!<br>
Desert with a ruffle!<br>
And not that beast on the lanai!!!”
<p>
<h4>Liv’s Glass Ass</h4>
A girl, name of Liv, from Alsace,<br>
Who had no left cheek to her ass,<br>
Once loved a New Yorker,<br>
A Tiffany worker,<br>
Who blew her prosthetics of glass.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Image: Gold Star!" align="right">
Favrile was the style of one ‘lefty’<br>
(Liv’s lover was skillful and defty).<br>
And further, it rang<br>
When he’d gently bang,<br>
And too, when farts blew from her clefty.
<p>
Another glass glute had two doors.<br>
Liv rented it out to some whores.<br>
These girls were all dwarves<br>
She’d met at the wharves.<br>
(I guess they were *all* ass lessors.)
<p>
One of the whores has a chair -<br>
A hole in the bottom for ‘air’.<br>
Embroidery sweet,<br>
And porcelain feet -<br>
She sneaks it one night in their lair.
<p>
“Pottery feet are like stones<br>
Cracking my ass!” Liv intones,<br>
“Go back to the pier!<br>
Your lease is quite clear:<br>
Glass housees should not stow thrones!”
<p>
<h4>Alopecia</h4>
A young alopecic named Jill<br>
Was, with her disease, in a thrill.<br>
It went from her toes<br>
Up just to her nose.<br>
Her razor bills? Zero to nil.
<p>
<h4>Bugger Bugs</h4>
A pervert who rode a bicycle<br>
Would bugger road-kill with his pickle.<br>
A bloated old deer<br>
Felt pleasantly queer;<br>
The maggot-squirms gave him a tickle!
<p>
<h4>Malfeasant Mashgiah:</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Image: Gold Star!" align="right">
There is an old mohel named Schmucks<br>
Who saves all the foreskins he plucks.<br>
Delightful pâté<br>
He serves on a tray,<br>
And all the guests think it is duck’s!
<p>
<h4>Mark the Polluter:</h4>
While sated on pork fat and beer<br>
Old Marky expressed his good cheer.<br>
He cracked off a medley -<br>
Not silent, but deadly -<br>
And damaged the Earth’s stratosphere.
<p>
<h4>Necropolis Unscrupulous</h4>
A gravedigger once did exhume<br>
Two corpses, intending to scrume.<br>
To make them the moister<br>
He hacked up an oyster<br>
And lubed their dry quims with his rheum.
<p>
<h4>Jack’s Live Act</h4>
There once was a bugger named Jack<br>
Who shoved a small mink up his crack.<br>
He loved the full feeling,<br>
And, too, when a-kneeling,<br>
The thrash of soft tail on his sac.
<p>
<h4>Natural Selection</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Image: Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a ten-foot brown bear<br>
Who woke when spring tickled the air.<br>
‘Twas too warm to nap -<br>
He needed to crap,<br>
And stretched, and breathed deep to prepare.
<p>
While pooping just next to a tree<br>
And taking a torrential pee,<br>
He rolled up his eyes<br>
And to his surprise<br>
A little gray squirrel watched with glee.
<p>
The bear was exceedingly fired,<br>
And through his clenched teeth he inquired,<br>
“Can’t a bear take a shit<br>
In the woods for a bit?<br>
This peeping is just not required!”
<p>
The squirrel said, “I’m sorry, dear sir,<br>
I don’t mean to badger or slur,<br>
But, curious me,<br>
I wanted to see<br>
If excrement sticks to brown fur.”
<p>
The bear, quite annoyed, said, “Dear girl,<br>
Does scat e’er adhere to *gray* curl?”<br>
She said, meekly, “Yes.”<br>
Then, to her distress,<br>
The bear wiped his ass with the squirrel.
<p>
<h4>Wild Wands</h4>
A bugger invented some dildoes<br>
Designed to incite bugger thrill-shows.<br>
The tips had three rotors,<br>
The afts had three motors<br>
To which were attached little twill-bows.
<p>
<h4>Necrobestiality</h4>
There once was a wino named Mack<br>
Who kept a dead cat in a sack.<br>
The puss decomposed,<br>
And so Mack kept closed<br>
The bag, ‘less he wanted some crack.

<h3>JaCkIn' JiLL writes 10/17/98</h3>
While I'm watchin the new video from Korn<br>
I wanked it while watching some porn<br>
When my hefty shaft spit it<br>
I no longer had the urge to hit it<br>
But for this I should be scorn(ed).

<h3>Deep-Goat writes 10/17/98</h3>
Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
When you're sitting on that cold toilet seat<br>
Shitting and straining<br>
And always complaining<br>
Of some food you did previously eat.
<p>
Monica, how far will you go<br>
To get on Springer's talk show?<br>
You're trailer park trash<br>
With a mountain of cash<br>
And the new queen of fellatio!
<p>
Now Clinton's about ready to chuck it<br>
Cuz he asked some fat bitch to suck it<br>
He's tired of fighting<br>
So soon he'll be writing<br>
Of limerical lads from Nantucket.
<p>
Monica's morals did slip<br>
When she swallowed the presidential tip<br>
She thought she'd go far<br>
And be a big Starr<br>
But instead poor Monica did Tripp.
<p>

To go where no one's gone before<br>
Vowed the captains of Star Trekial yore<br>

Because bald were three out of four!

There once was a private named Ryan<br>
In war his brothers all ended up dyin'<br>
A search they did strive at<br>
And they saved Ryan's privates<br>
So rebuildin' his family he is now tryin'.

There once was a skanky old whore,<br>
Whose best years were pre-civil war<br>
Her cunt it ran dry,<br>
'Bout Nineteen o' five<br>
Now hand jobs are even a chore.

<h3>Davy TarTar writes 10/11/98</h3>
A prosecutorial zealot named Starr<br>
Has spent 45 million thus far<br>
To prove the President’s agenda<br>
Included young Monica’s pudenda<br>
And an illegal Cuban Cigar!

I think it worth sharing with you."</i>

There is a wee guy named Propriety<br>

The President (sat quite alone)<br>
By the Whitehouse's video-phone<br>
Admitted the fact<br>
Of an inappropriate act<br>
In which more than his cover was blown.

<h3>Brick House writes 10/09/98</h3>
There once was a Catherine the Great<br>
With a horse she did copulate<br>
The steed's legs did give,<br>
And she ceased to live<br>
Though her stud did not seem too irate...

<i>The poet comments, "A much debated historical fact..."</i>

<h3>Annette Funicello writes 10/07/98</h3>
One time, I saw this cute dude<br>
He asked me to go out for food<br>
We went out, instead<br>
For a beer, and some head<br>
See what happens when you're in the mood?
<p>
Barney's a fat dinosaur<br>
Who whacks off his bone on a whore<br>
He likes little boys<br>
And kinky sex toys<br>
He's named his left hand "Lenore"
<p>

One time, when I was just three<br>
I bent over to watch myself pee<br>
It went in my eye<br>
(My aim was too high)<br>
And therefore, I could not see!

<h3>Allan Cowley writes a big one 10/06/98</h3>
<h2>A Fitting End To One Blown Out Of Proportion</h2>
<h4>I   The Valley Girl</h4>

An adventurous intern named Monica,<br>
Told Linda Bill's love did astonish her,<br>
"If I'd known all I'd get,<br>
"Was my underwear wet,<br>
"I'd have kept our relations platonic-er."
<p>
Monica, cute and well-thatched, who<br>
Delivers on broadloom unmatched woo,<br>
Says, "I'm not in this place,<br>
"With my lips to embrace,<br>
"Bill's schtick, but whom it's attached to."
<p>
Our Bill is a fun sort of bloke<br>
Who rather than give her a poke<br>
Let Monica chew it<br>
But later she blew it<br>
When in Tripp her greed she awoke.
<p>
To Starr, with his jihad embargoed,<br>
Said Linda, "To have him Sukarno'd<br>
"Here's a tape cut in Hell,<br>
"What a book deal I'll sell,<br>
"With more chutzpah than Benedict Arnold."
<p>
Says Ken, "Ms. Tripp, I admire your stealth,"<br>
(Between jobs for great cigarette wealth)<br>
"Satan's not the right icon,<br>
"In what state was the mike on?<br>
"To be certain, I'll tape it myself."
<p>
Thought Bill in a moment so doubtful,<br>
With Starr coming on a tad frightful,<br>
"That guy is a mutt,<br>
"My polls are high, but<br>
"What Monica said was a mouthful."
<p>

<h4>II   Independent of What?</h4>

Asks Starr like a biblical prelate<br>
"Ms. L., were you paid, did you fellate?"<br>
She says, "Facts such as those<br>
"I will never disclose<br>
"In a court, not Supreme, not Appellate."
<p>
For Monica, Starr is rapacious,<br>
Replaying those tapes most salacious,<br>
"Here's immunity,<br>
"To set your tongue free,<br>
"And tickle my Staff most bodacious."
<p>
The temple of justice still glitters,<br>
The News seeks new sins for its twitters,<br>
Each wanted to sleuth but<br>
In this case to truth cut,<br>
The comics with skits and sidesplitters.
<p>
Clean or dirty, jokes show to the eyes,<br>
What details often tend to disguise.<br>
So it's easy to see<br>
(They protest in DC?)<br>
Bedfellows, not so odd, sex and lies.
<p>
Starr's Report was more silly than complex<br>
(And murdered privacy, balance and checks).<br>
After all that had leaked,<br>
We felt sorry we peeked,<br>
And besides it wasn't even great sex!
<p>
Tripp's tapes had meant those holding press passes,<br>
Could talk dirty yet preach to the masses,<br>
Till the last polls told them no,<br>
Bill Clinton still is our ho,<br>
Now they're left with their heads up their asses.
<p>
<h4>III. A Placque-ation</h4>

After months of this media chorus<br>
The people told Congress, "You bore us,<br>
"From your jobs you'll be free."<br>
They said, "It's been, we agree,<br>
"Easy work – So now who's the whore – us?"
<p>
"Since lawyers, Baptists and fems on the skids,<br>
"Lefties and Rightists have for fame all made bids,<br>
"We now need a story that soothes,<br>
"And covers self-evident truths,<br>
"With  fig leaves for the mighty and  lessons  for kids."
<p>
Forgetting great men would be callous,<br>
So we honor their fame without malice,<br>
But a pillar would seem,<br>
To unerringly mean,<br>
We'd memorialized Bill with a phallus.
<p>
So to find lies fit for ending  this fable,<br>
Congress met in backrooms, not on cable,<br>
And when Hillary proposed<br>
Congress quickly disposed,<br>
In the White House, a plaque, here's the label:
<p>
After Bill Led The Polls To Bag Dole,<br>
TV Never Spun Out Of Control,<br>
Ms. Tripp Was A Rat,<br>
Ms. L. A Young Brat,<br>
But Starr's Boner Was Just His Flagpole.
<p>
 In Bed, Bill's A Great President,<br>
Whose Tool – I'll Confirm It -- Is Bent,<br>
Since He Put It In Double,<br>
To Save Monica Trouble,<br>
He's Not Guilty Of Coming -- He Went.
<p>
By His Wife, For Much Blather And Blithery Flak,<br>
Bill's Bottom Was  Spanked With Her Knees As The Rack,<br>
And Told, "Don't Trust A Girl<br>
"With  Big Hair  In  A Curl,<br>
"And Kneepads  And A Tongue That Twirls Slithery!" – WHACK!

Bill had an intern named Monica<br>
Who he thought was skilled on harmonica.<br>

The President's sin and its wages<br>
Will be judged by Congressional sages.<br>
But let us compose<br>
The jury of those<br>
Who never got blowjobs from pages!

<p>
...If so, then that most august forum<br>
Quite likely won't muster a quorum.<br>

What to do with the charges?<br>

Henry Hyde tried to give the impression<br>
That his sex life was in a recession.<br>
He ruined her life,<br>
Which killed his poor wife.<br>
That's his "youthful [sic!] indiscretion".

Ken Starr has campaigned against smut.<br>
His case is quite open and shut.<br>

The Right compares Clinton to Nero.<br>

Is that the man lied.<br>

So wonders his curious nation.<br>
If his balls hit the floor<br>
Would it even the score<br>
And bring Congress complete jubilation?

<h4>by A. N. Wilkins       </h4>
Though no signal was ever more trite,<br>
A man doesn't have to be bright--<br>
He may not know beans<br>
To be sure what it means,<br>
Whenever he sees a red light.
<p>

<h4>by Bob Giandomenico    </h4>
A cardiac patient named Lutz,<br>
Finds his pace-maker driving his nuts.<br>
His sex life's a strife,<br>
For while loving his wife,<br>
His garage door then opens and shuts.
<p>

An eighty year old was Sir John,<br>
When he wed twenty year old Yvonne.<br>
His friends told him, "Jack,<br>
She's a sex maniac."<br>
Sir John said, "You're putting me one."
<p>

When they asked G. B. Shaw about balling,<br>
He said it was not that enthralling;<br>
For the pleasure's too quick,<br>
And the price makes one sick,<br>
As for the position: appalling!
<p>

A feeble old dotard named Ned<br>
Once took a young woman to bed.<br>
When she asked, "Is it in?"<br>
He replied with chagrin,<br>
"I've got it all in but the head."
<p>

Adam made love to Eve in a dell,<br>
Then the Lord came and Eve ran pell mell.<br>
In her terror to flee<br>
She leapt into the sea,<br>
And that is why fish have that smell.
<p>

<h4>by Theo M. Heller      </h4>
When Adam and Eve played in Eden,<br>
Only boys came from all of their breedin'.<br>
Well, maybe I'm dumb--<br>
Where'd the gals all come from?<br>
Did one of their sons go to Sweden?
<p>

<h4>by Al Chaplin          </h4>
In the Garden of Eden man's fate<br>
Was determined when Eve took the bait.<br>
But no apple, I think,<br>
Could have raised such a stink--<br>
It was Adam's banana she ate.
<p>

<h4>by Jane D. Hughes      </h4>
When Eve Adam first tried to make,<br>
He found it was no piece of cake.<br>
So though it seemed odd,<br>
Adam beseeched his God,<br>
"Please tell me, Lord, what's a headache?"
<p>

<h4>by A. N. Wilkins       </h4>
If in Eden he didn't once make<br>
His woman nor ever partake<br>
Of sexual play,<br>
As some preachers say,<br>
Adam certainly owed one to the snake.
<p>

<h4>by Don Moore           </h4>
A gay rabbi said fervently, "We've<br>
Made translations of what we believe<br>
To be Genesis pure,<br>
And we found out for sure<br>
It's the story of Adam and Steve."
<p>

<h4>by Al Chaplin          </h4>
When the atom he split by his wit,<br>
With uranium man made a big hit.<br>
But it did not compare<br>
To the time Eve laid bare<br>
And Adam observed the first split.
<p>

<h4>by Grand Prix Limericks</h4>
The cheap whorehouse of yore is no more<br>
And its dying we deeply deplore.<br>
For today, high tail prices<br>
Turn teenagers to vices,<br>
Like murder, rape, pillage, and gore.
<p>

<h4>by Al Willis           </h4>
A young virgin without petticoat,<br>
On a waterbed with an old goat,<br>
"I'm a person," she said<br>
As her clothing was shed,<br>
But he thinks that she's his cherry float.
<p>

<h4>by Bob Giandomenico    </h4>
Though she'd braces, a coed, Miss Banks,<br>
Was quite generous with her oral pranks.<br>
With her braces removed,<br>
Her skills so improved,<br>
That the team sent her dentist their thanks.
<p>

The game between sexes eschews,<br>
Any reason that one can peruse,<br>
For the facts are hereof,<br>
That she screws to get love,<br>
While he only loves to get screws.
<p>

<h4>by William N. Nesbit   </h4>
Tennis elbow was painful to Fred,<br>
So they screwed off the top of his head;<br>
Then to deaden the pain<br>
They removed half his brain.<br>
Now he's taken up golfing instead.
<p>

<h4>by Michael Weinstein   </h4>
Last Saturday night Mrs. Lizst<br>
Lost two-hundred bucks playing whist.<br>
The blue streak that she swore<br>
Woke the priest up next door,<br>
And he added some fine points she missed.
<p>

<h4>by Bob Giandomenico    </h4>
The coach said, "Our kicker's the wrong one,<br>
Linda Lovelace might just be a strong one.<br>
Though it's certainly true,<br>
That she's blown quite a few,<br>
She has never yet choked on a long one."
<p>

A girl who bowls nightly, sweet Sally,<br>
With boys on the team loves to dally.<br>
She commits many sins,<br>
'Midst the balls and the pins,<br>
And explains, "This is right up my alley!"
<p>

A student of fencing, untrussed,<br>
Told her teacher who lunged with great lust,<br>
"Touche! I am foiled,<br>
Your moves are well oiled,<br>
I can no longer parry your thrust."
<p>

A young baseball pitcher named Witter,<br>
Made the lady fans giggle and titter.<br>
They would gasp in the stands,<br>
With a stirring of glands,<br>
When he showed them his slider and spitter.
<p>

<h4>by Stu Lucas           </h4>
Boasted Humperdink as he was jinking<br>
The chink of the girl he was linking,<br>
"You may laugh with derision,<br>
But my circumcision<br>
Was done with some shears meant for pinking."
<p>

<h4>by Phil Cannibal       </h4>
To her daughter, a lady named Bursa<br>
Said, "Risks with young men are now worser.<br>
When a boy friend you meet,<br>
Don't get in the back seat--<br>
Don't let boys snatch a kiss and vice versa."
