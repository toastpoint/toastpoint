What's the trouble with nuclear detente?<br>

Answer India's nukes<br>
With its own dread rebukes? ... <br>
Or that Uncle Sam's no Asian aunt?

Was told, "Pack a grip, <br>
You're taking a trip."<br>
Hero today, gone to Maui!

A sartain arrhythmical bum,<br>

His lines do not flow,<br>
For they never quite go:<br>
De-dum diddy dum diddy dum!

At a Web site called toastpoint.com<br>

Add four more of your own --<br>
Whether nice, or off-tone --<br>
And get starred if they shine with aplomb!

There once was a young girl named Lynn,<br>
Who was fighting with her sister, Gwynn.<br>
She said, very smugly,<br>
"I think that you're ugly,"<br>
Forgetting that she was a twin.

But the big question stood:<br>
Did those fellows get severance pay?

I married a girl called Felicity<br>
And she lights up my life (with simplicity)<br>
From her head to her toes<br>
She shines and she glows<br>
Cause I keep her plugged in electricity!

I saw what I thought was a comet<br>
As I looked through my scope, 'twas a rocket<br>
It was veering off course<br>
Like a pig-drunken horse<br>
And inside was Wallace and Gromit!

I propose that cheap horses are rare<br>
Whether stallion or gelding or mare<br>
And rare ones are expensive<br>
So I figure (being pensive)<br>
Cheap = expensive, so there!

For good eyes -- I won't tell you again!"

Don't even think twice,<br>
Never play leap-frog with a unicorn!

Poor Sumaq, scorched off by my flame!<br>
What a shock! what a sin! what a shame!<br>

How much does a talk-show host earn?<br>
I've tried very hard to discern.<br>

Made him drop cherry pie on the floor<br>
Then her face turned bright red<br>
And ahe laughed instead<br>

A nearsighted bookkeeper from Queens<br>
Could not find me the section on dreams<br>
I hesitated on socking her<br>
Because I did not want to mock her<br>
Plus what a shame to ruin my jeans.

<h3>Friar writes 05/21/98</h3>
Our headline read: 'Flu Bug Bites Durban'<br>
(That's my home town, it's small, but it's urban)<br>
Now, if bugs come that big<br>
I'm as thick as a pig<br>
Or else, I've had far too much bourbon.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Hic, hic!  Durban (pronounced Durbin, where I live) is actually a

A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>
Thought he'd bought a ``church belt'' for his jeans<br>
How mail order deceived! ..<br>
'Twas a bell he received ...<br>
But its rope did the trick, by all means!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Take 2"</i>
<p>
A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>

If absolved by a priest<br>
Who could see through confessional screens!

<h3>Gandolph writes 05/20/98</h3>
There once was a sea turtle named Myrtle<br>
Who hated to wear her girdle.<br>
"It is much too tight<br>
And it doesn't fit right<br>
And I still have the shape of a turtle."

<h3>Bob shares a classic 05/20/98</h3>
There once was a lady named Bright<br>
Who could travel much faster than light <br>

In a relative way<br>
And returned the previous night.

<h3><a href=mailto:raj_pi@yahoo.com>P.I</a> writes 05/20/98</h3>

<h3>Al Willis sent a bunch 5/20</h3>
The young folks have something to learn,<br>
And they are not quick to discern<br>
The public's great love<br>
And the song stylings of<br>
Patti, Maxene, and LaVerne.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "If you don't know who they are, ask Gramps."</i>
<p>

The saints all believe, without proof.<br>
When they die they go up on the roof.<br>
        Their fervor won't wane,<br>
        As they pray in the rain,<br>
And I'm sure that they're quite waterproof.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I look bad when I wake up. I do. <br>
I resemble a gnu with the flu. <br>
        My breath, like a swine's <br>
        And my eyes with red lines... <br>
May I ask, did you just get up too?
<p>
The Indian was rendered head saddum <br>
Because we have harnessed the atom. <br>
        "To avoid being dead," <br>
        He despondently said, <br>
"We'll build teepees much stronger and pad 'em.
<p>
All the bees walk through flowers with glee. <br>
Then they fly away info a tree. <br>
        The birds touch the pollen, <br>
        And I know it's appallin,' <br>
But that's what I think, and I'm three.
<p>
A chelonia propels kind of slow. <br>
She's not known for speed, as you know. <br>
        At times, she's quite fertile. <br>
        Most people say "turtle," <br>
And her head, sometimes, just doesn't show.
<p>
There was a young lady named Spring <br>
And saving whales was her thing. <br>
        But I'm not so grand, <br>
        You understand, <br>
'Cuz I save stamps and string.
<p>
She's no longer a young Irish lass. <br>
In fact, she has had a bypass. <br>
        Her hair, it is true, <br>
        Is really quite blue, <br>
But she hasn't quite run out of gas.
<p>
She was cuddly and age eighty-eight <br>
She said, about marriage, "Let's wait."<br>
        "My hair must be dyed <br>
        (I do have my pride) <br>
And they're building my new upper plate."
<p>
My wife is no longer a miss. <br>
While her hair is quite blue, I'll say this: <br>
        In years now long gone, <br>
        She was sleek as a fawn, <br>
And now I can just reminisce.
<p>
He hated her hue, that is true. <br>
Her hair was too blue, in his view. <br>
        He once badly dyed her <br>
        And could not abide her. <br>
So he slapped on some H202.
<p>
A chemist whom some of you know<br>
Just loved to see ice and deep snow.<br>
   He mixed Tungsten and Tin <br>
   And some Oxygen,<br>
And he finally fashioned some SnOW.

<p>
No matter how much you may goad,<br>
I refuse to dissect a live toad.<br>
   No ifs, ands, or buts,<br>
   I don't have the guts,<br>
And that is the end of this ode.
<p>
Was I forty just ten years ago? <br>
At the time, I was feeling gung ho. <br>
        Are my numbers wrong? <br>
        Is this my swan song? <br>
My good wife swears that I'm seven O.
<p>
When I look at my face in the mirror<br>
And my wife speaks and I cannot hear her. <br>
        I think my youth's gone <br>
        Like some dying swan.<br>
The grim reaper, methinks, is now nearer.
<p>
We cannot stand many more losses.<br>
Our charts will soon look just like Ross'. <br>
        We've downsized our crew; <br>
        Our bills are past due.<br>
We'll have to get rid of the bosses!
<p>
If business is lousy, don't sweat it.<br>
When you see lots of debit, no credit, <br>
        Take the cash from the till <br>
        And abscond to Brazil.<br>
Take that P and L statement and shred it!
<p>
The kids who are born are first-rate.<br>
But they're fewer than ever, of late. <br>
        There's no hanky-panky <br>
        'Twixt Johnny and Frankie.<br>
It's because of that Heidi Force Raite.
<p>
That fan wouldn't move; it stayed straight.<br>
It must have been made in Kuwait. <br>
        Please take the fan back, <br>
        As the thing's out of whack.<br>
All the fans that I know ovulate.

There was a young girl from Gloucester<br>
Whose parents thought they had lost her<br>
From the fridge came a sound<br>
And there she was found<br>
But the trouble was how to defrost her!
