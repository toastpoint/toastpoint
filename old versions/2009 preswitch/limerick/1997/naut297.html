Of course you don't French Kiss a chicken.<br>

Contemplating such stuff,<br>
Your brain will rapidly sicken.

And let him do push-ups in you!

<h3>Dee Skusting writes 02/15/97</h3>
The cheese from a virgin's vagina<br>
Is a delicacy prized in old China.<br>

Is generally considered much finer!

The box said "Takes 2 D-Cell Batteries"<br>

<h3>Hummer shares a classic 02/14/97</h3>
There once were two ladies from Birmingham<br>
Who dealt with matters not concerning 'em<br>
They reache under the robes<br>
And tickled the globes<br>
Of the Bishop who then was confiming 'em!

Now this Bishop, he wasn't a fool<br>
He knew what to do with that duel<br>
He whipped off his britches<br>
And gave those two bitches<br>
A foot of Episcopal tool!

<h3>Dr. Dirty writes 02/13/97</h3>
Beavis & Butthead were party to a bacchanalia,<br>

"Heh! Um! Learn to be upright like our genitalia!"

<h4>Cock's Lament</h4>
I don't have a pecker, but maybe I should -<br>
I told the red hen that I would if I could<br>
She envies the mares and cows<br>
The nannies, the ewes, and sows<br>
Since she heard that some bird has one made out of wood!

Instead of petroleum jelly.

Eugene told a girl from Schenectady<br>
Who was tapping her oxfords expectantly,<br>
"I meant no affront<br>

<h4>Operation Theatrics</h4>
A surgeon, resting after handing over terse,<br>
Was woken by the commotions like tremors,<br>
Staring at his assistant wise,<br>
He elucidated, "By sterilize,<br>
I had only meant only the pair of scissors!"
<p>
<i>The Sage likes the concept, but doesn't understand the first line.</i>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The first
line was intended to convey that the surgeon had probably 
had a gruelling schedule and had handed over a new operation
tersely to his assistant (by passing him the torch, i mean, the
scissors) and saying Sterilize. "</i>

Once screwed a toy bear<br>
Which had lost all its hair:<br>
An action which utterly wrecked Teddy!

Desiring an unwrinkled scrotum<br>
I rubbed oil on my bollocks to coat 'em.<br>
It made me feel hornier,<br>

Who had something wrong with his back. <br>

Testified he attacked her, <br>
But she soon beat him off with a whack.

I really do like to drink beer<br>
For it makes the world perfectly clear. <br>

Flat on my back under here.

So we ought to commit them at least."

We ought to recall in this bliss<br>
Of our revels, that man<br>

Cleopatra appeared at the border, <br>
And telling the queen he adored her, <br>
It was Caesar who came, <br>
Saw, and conquered the dame, <br>
But probably not in that order.

What happened between you and Clyde, <br>
Who made love to you one night outside<br>
In the hammock?" asked Sue. <br>
"Oh, I thought you knew. <br>
We fell out," Henrietta replied.
<p>
An old codger proposed to Sue, <br>
Though when asked about sex, he was blue. <br>

Into Adam and Eve's simple life. <br>
Adam, when they began, <br>
Took his woes like a man -- <br>
He blamed all of them on his wife.

Give pause to your drinking<br>
And make you start thinking. <br>
A little won't hurt -- but a lot'll.

The expense of a bottle of brandy<br>
Is undoubtedly more<br>
Than is needed to score --<br>
So if candy is handy, it's dandy.

I simply throw up in the sink.

The fine art of getting her plastered;<br>

Don't ever drink Mexican rum,<br>
Which makes morals and nerve-endings numb.<br>
You'll awake the next morn<br>
With your panty-hose torn,<br>
And your tonsils all gummy with come.

My boyfriend got down on his knee,<br>
And he told me how happy he'd be<br>
When we'd gone down the aisle,<br>
But he soon lost his smile<br>
When I asked him to go down on me.

The angler fish courteth his mate,<br>
Then he makes for her vaginal gate;<br>

Saint Augustine was one of the greater<br>

An ape hailed the Pope and said, "Hi, mate!<br>
We're cousins, you know.  It's no lie, mate."<br>

<p>
A delectable widow named Lyme<br>
Is enjoying her sexual prime;<br>
Having briefly inclined<br>
To the life of the mind,<br>
She returned to her senses in time.
<p>
What the marital manuals say --<br>
No surprise to the wise fiance --<br>
Is the cherry's expendable<br>
(And it's verily vendible),<br>
That its pitting is fitting today.
<p>
When a sheikh of the Gulf too a bride,<br>
At the moment of entry she shied;<br>

I could handle the times with the Torah<br>
And the days we were dancing the hora,<br>
But it then came to pass --<br>
What a pain in the ass! --<br>
That we ran out of gas in Gomorrah.

Were processing words as a pair.<br>

When she developed an embarassing callus.<br>

The Sultan was pissed as can be<br>
At the girls in his harem when he<br>
Ran a big boobs contest<br>
To see whose were the best,<br>
And his eunuchs came in one, two, three.
<p>
The young Sultan, ordinarily so mild,<br>
When let loose in the harem goes wild.<br>
He once buggered his two<br>
Hundred wives in a queue,<br>
And got 86 tapeworms with child.

By 'in vitro' detente in a crucible.<br>
But the act is maligned,<br>
Though the product's in kind,<br>
As the honeymoon's irreproducible.

Said the gorilla as he eyed the fair lassie<br>
With the classiest curvaceous chassis,<br>
"My pop carried Fay<br>
Up a building to play,<br>
But I'll lay this one here on the grassy."<br>

<h4>By Martin Wellborn</h4>
I don't go with the world's fast-paced trends;<br>
My simple life merely extends<br>
To a place by the bay<br>
At which I can lay<br>
My hat and a few of my friends.
