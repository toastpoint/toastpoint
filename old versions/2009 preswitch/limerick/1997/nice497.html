<h3>K. B. Montgomery writes 04/30/97</h3>
There once was a piggy named Sammy<br>
Who thought that a cow was his mammy.<br>
The pig said " Moo"<br>
The cow said " Pew" <br>
And Sammy got kicked in the fanny!

I am pretty fiery, I trove.<br>
I'll put lots of wood in my stove;<br>
I'll make it so hot<br>
I'll burn up the lot<br>
Of armour and weapons, by Jove!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 04/30/97</h3>
The man said, "I'm proud of my bruise."<br>
So, his body I tried to peruse.<br>
The man was sincere;<br>
He liked making beer.<br>
It seems he was proud of his BREWS!

<i>The poet comments, "Is there any way to print just some of these, without printing all of them?"</i>
<p>
<I>Nope, other than cut 'n' paste.</I>

<h4> Dr. Insomniac's Comments</h4>
After his analysis, sound and deep,<br>
He had this to say about falling asleep,<br>
"Just because over one's chin,<br>
 One wears a sheepish grin,<br>
 Doesn't imply one had counted sheep!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:jorna@cybernet.dk>Jorna</a> writes 04/29/97</h3>
In daytime I'm leaching the teaching.<br>
At nighttime I'm beaching - I'm reaching!<br>
In Pleroma I roam;<br>
In this dome, I'm at home!<br>
Can you tell me what teaching I'm preaching?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "leaching=distilling, as in wood ash and animal fat=soap."</i>
<p>
<I>Can you solve the riddle?</I>
<p>
A lack of an inner integrity<br>
Could be said to have spawned this profligacy<br>
Of graffitti on walls - <br>
They sure have the b*lls!<br>
These children with no sense of dignity!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A Tel Aviv couple must wince<br>
After marrying just four months since - <br>
For to nuptials they'd brung<br>
Fully seventeen young<br>
And now they're expecting some quints!

There was a time when I could<br>
Wake up each morning and would<br>
Feel as good as the last<br>
Morning, that which was past.<br>
Well, today I don't feel so damned good!

<h3>Anonymous writes 04/27/97</h3>
There once was a squirrel named Rose<br>
Who stuck a nut up her nose<br>
She blew and she blew<br>
Till out the nut flew<br>
She learned her lesson, I suppose.

I read lots of books, doncha know. <br>
"Miss Smilla's Emotion for Snow":<br>
The best one I've read,<br>
Goes straight to my head,<br>
Though, personally, snow is my foe!
<p>
<I>Toast Point loves that book.  He was amused to find that the alliterative English translation of the title, "Smilla's Sense of Snow", was preceded by another translation, "Miss Smilla's Feeling's Toward Snow".  This prompted <a href= http://www.grandiose.com/vance.html >a friend of his</a> to come up with a better one, "Missy Smilla's Snow Empathy and How It Grew".</I>

<h3>Al Willis writes 04/27/97</h3>
If I kill all the bugs, I'll be bugless.<br>
If I trash all the drugs, I'll be drugless.<br>
It's said that I'm ripe,<br>
And this isn't just hype.<br>
If I don't take a bath, I'll be hugless.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Hkleidman@aol.com>Lo and Behold</a> writes 04/27/97</h3>
There once was a Lady Macbeth<br>
Who chewed garlic to sweeten her breath<br>
When she expelled through her bonnet<br>
'Twas no Shakespeare sonnet<br>
Albeit court callers died a tragedian death.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:sman@loop.com>Macsam</a>, who had a very busy Saturday, writes 04/26/97</h3>
A remorseful young man named Nat<br>
Tried hard to find where life was at.<br>
Wine, women and song<br>
Put his thinking all wrong.<br>
Too much of those things can do that.
<p>
An Israeli art dealer awoke<br>
And dined while his wife told a joke.<br>
He inhaled what he ate<br>
And she found out too late<br>
She made her Jerusalem arty-choke.
<p>
Bizarre is the word for van Gogh<br>
Who cut off his ear, as you know.<br>
When he wanted it back,<br>
What made his mood black<br>
Was the fact he had not learned to sew.
<p>
A man who lived south of the border<br>
Had a wife, but could not afford her.<br>
He worried so much<br>
About Jaguars and such<br>
He developed a sleeping disorder.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A fortunate fish is the cod<br>
Who owes it mostly to God<br>
And a little good luck<br>
That he isn't stuck<br>
All his life with a name like the scrod.
<p>
Strange is the name of the manatee,<br>
Who're not afflicted with vanity.<br>
They don't care how they look<br>
When their picture is took<br>
(Which for ladies amounts to insanity).
<p>
Lucky's the beast called the kudu,<br>
Which has very little tu du<br>
But sleep, eat and drink,<br>
And that's why, I think,<br>
It has much less stress than yu du.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Stella is known for her eyes.<br>
They're not of quite the same size.<br>
So small is the right<br>
It won't admit light;<br>
While the left's like the moon on the rise.
<p>
One thing can be stated as fact:<br>
More teachers have now been attacked<br>
Than ever before.<br>
Still, it is poor<br>
To call the whole thing a class act.
<p>
As far as wild oats are concerned,<br>
There's a lesson that needs to be learned.<br>
We reap what we sow.<br>
That much I know - <br>
I, who have been badly burned.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A hard-drinking fellow one morn<br>
Felt standard libations were worn.<br>
With magnesium milk<br>
He mixed vodka or ilk;<br>
Thus the 'Phillips screwdriver' was born.
<p>
A man who was always quite mean<br>
Nearly died in a wreck as a teen.<br>
They left in his side<br>
A hole that can't hide<br>
The fact he had vented his spleen.
<p>
The Good Book says not to deceive.<br>
What I state here is true, I believe.<br>
Upon some relection,<br>
When it comes to injection,<br>
It's more blessed to give than receive.
<p>
The warthog is terribly warty<br>
It has a million and forty.<br>
You would think it should seem<br>
A dermatologist's dream<br>
To catch one while out on a sortie.
<p>
What it's often like on committee<br>
Is to spend lots of time on your sittee.<br>
What may be inept<br>
In minutes are kept<br>
While hours are wasted - more's the pittee.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
The stock market, as we all know,<br>
Can deal one a rather hard blow.<br>
I think I'd do better<br>
If I could unfetter<br>
My penchant for "Buy high, sell low."
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
An expert safecracker with brawn<br>
Was caught at his work before dawn.<br>
Though he paid for his deeds,<br>
His epitaph reads,<br>
"Here lies both a pro and a con."
<p>
The battle of sexes is raging,<br>
And like wine and cheese has been aging.<br>
But, unlike those two,<br>
It's simply not true<br>
That the war improves with its waging.
<p>
A man who loathed to be last<br>
Would also drive very fast.<br>
He also tailgated,<br>
Which was quite ill-fated;<br>
He's now in a full-body cast.
<p>
Some consider it crudity;<br>
Still others think it lewdity.<br>
Yet Renoir and such<br>
Contributed much<br>
To promoting the art of nudity.
<p>
The wife of a star-gazing man<br>
Said, "I've taken all that I can.<br>
Your looking at Venus<br>
Has quite come between us.<br>
It's time you examined my <I>tan</I>."
<p>
Breasts were a lovely invention.<br>
They're best when the skin's under tension.<br>
On occasion it's not;<br>
Those cases are what<br>
Keep surgeons from going on pension.
<p>
A tamer of lions from Maine<br>
From opening their mouths couldn't refrain.<br>
One day he got bold,<br>
And now, I am told<br>
He's as headless as Ichabod Crane.
<p>
If you've never been to a zoo<br>
You may doubt what I say here is true.<br>
In season of rut<br>
The inmates are not<br>
Concerned by a voyeur or two.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Limerick writing's no cinch.<br>
Sometimes one gets in a pinch.<br>
It's rather a strain<br>
To rack one's own brain<br>
In order the fifth line to clinch.
<p>
In deserts like the Sahara<br>
The times people starve is quite rara.<br>
One reason, I've heard,<br>
Though it may be absurd,<br>
Is because of the sand-wiches thera.
<p>
Hickory, Dickory, Dock.<br>
Three mice ran up the old clock.<br>
The clock struck one<br>
When its hands it swung.<br>
The last two wouldn't hear of such tock.
<p>
My daughter swears somebody told her<br>
Of a Far Eastern man, who, though older<br>
Than some of the rest,<br>
Could contort with the best,<br>
And was known as "The Manila Folder."
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
The appendix resembles a worm,<br>
Though it doesn't burrow or squirm.<br>
It's largely ignored <br>
Till a surgeon is bored<br>
Or his bills have made <I>him</I> infirm.
<p>
A strange-sounding beast is the gnu,<br>
Whose name I pronounce with some rue.<br>
The cause of my fits<br>
Is, were all names like its,<br>
Just think how we'd have to spell gSue.
<p>
If you're not afraid of the water<br>
After reading how "Jaws" got the daughter<br>
Of some poor old man,<br>
Then think less of your tan<br>
And more ahout that which you oughter.
<p>
A strange thing it is about hair<br>
(I speak here for men, to be fair).<br>
They comb, brush and fuss<br>
And often times cuss<br>
Over something that soon won't be there.
<p>
One interesting thing seems quite clear:<br>
The number of cookbooks appear-<br>
Ing for people to buy<br>
Is equalled by di-<br>
Eting books, year after year.
<p>
A doctor of orthopedium<br>
Thought life with wife one of tedium.<br>
They decided to part<br>
When he discovered art<br>
To be a new happy medium.
<p>
A couple who lived in the West<br>
Lived a life singularly blessed.<br>
He would only let her<br>
Give others his 'better,'<br>
Reserving for her all his 'best.'
<p>
A hunter a lioness spied<br>
And decided to go for a ride.<br>
The lion awoke<br>
And ate the poor bloke,<br>
Thinking he'd injured his pride.
<p>
A short little man from Quebec<br>
Had a toothache and went for a check.<br>
When he wanted to know<br>
Why the tooth had to go,<br>
He was told, "Ees Toulouse, Lautrec."
<p>
In Tulsa, a prior bed-wettor<br>
Grew up to be a big debtor.<br>
He gambled in college,<br>
And friends all acknowledge<br>
His fame as "the Sooner, the Bettor."
<p>
An overweight vulture, named Marion,<br>
When others had eaten, would tarry on.<br>
She was slow to embark,<br>
Which caused the remark,<br>
"Your excess baggage must be carrion."
<p>
On a whim, a man tempted fate<br>
And entered a gay bar, quite late.<br>
What a fix he was in<br>
When, to their chagrin,<br>
They found he was a "closet straight."
<p>
A lean, young peripatetic<br>
Thinks slimness may be genetic.<br>
Both father and son<br>
Find sleepwalking fun,<br>
Despite a pace that's frenetic.
<p>
Some cannibals thought it quite queer<br>
That a verse-spouting judge showed no fear.<br>
When ready to dine<br>
They hung up a sign:<br>
"Poetic justice served here."
<p>
While Tweety's well known for his chirp,<br>
And Pluto's trademark is his slurp,<br>
For human fame<br>
One needs a name<br>
Like Wyatt, famous for his bEarp.
<p>
It may be that there is no man<br>
Who's seen the abominable snowman -<br>
Who's known also as yeti;<br>
Yet I think if we met, he<br>
Might run as fast as <I>he</I> could go, man
<p>
Many females wear a B-bra;<br>
Others are proud of their C-bra.<br>
But were there a prize<br>
For purely grade size,<br>
It'd have to go to the Zebra.
<p>
An oft-married actress from Cannes<br>
Was known for her men and her tannes.<br>
Alone, she awoke,<br>
Stretched slowly and spoke,<br>
"It's good to feel like a new mannes."

You'll find - with no ifs, buts, or maybes --<br>
Old age is as pleasant as scabies!<br>
You'll discover, alas,<br>
With your teeth in a glass<br>
That diapers are not just for babies!

<I>Happy birthday, CB!</I>

A student once met a nice gambler.<br>
As he kissed her, he said, "I'm a rambler!"<br>
They wed, drove by car,<br>
Played the cards wide and far.<br>
So life soon became a dambler.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "dambler=damned blur (for thos without imagination, I guess)"</i>

<I>Jorna, your <a href=naut497.html#jorna>"jane" poem</a> was classified as naughty and placed in the appropiate section of the contest.</I>
<hr>
<I>Glinda, the conscience of the Squeaky-Clean Limerick Contest, has decided that we should not post Puffy Flatliner's submitted limericks of 4/22, as they are neither squeaky-clean nor nice enough to be included here.  Bitchy attacks on other submitter's poems are really only appropriate in the Naughty section, where the attackee can flame back with the appropriate verbal tools.</I>

On this strange little farm near Mt. Steep,<br>
The cows make a sound like a sheep.<br>
The chickens say "moo,"<br>
And the roosters say "hoo,"<br>
And the pigs make a sound like "cheep, cheep."
<p>

A lobster has reasons aplenty;<br>
(At least, he has fifteen or twenty.)<br>
He should jump from the pot<br>
And run like a shot<br>
To avoid H2O caliente.

Thy homepage is terribly uncouth<br>
But thou take my advice now, forsooth!<br>
Of one thousand, thou raneth,<br>
But one verse that scaneth!<br>
Now, showing the bad ones, thou rueth?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wouldn't run any that don't scan. Instead I would return them, also with a "tweaked" version so they scan, and thus try to teach people how. I do believe that most sit with a Thesaurus, figure on end words and then have no sense of rythm to boot."</i>

<I>Toast Point reiterates that entries get posted, regardless of quality.  However, that leaves them open for comments such as this excellent (and true) one. </I>

There once was a silver flute<br>
Who fell in love with a lute<br>
She plucked each string<br>
And started to sing<br>
"Show me you care and I'll toot!"

I found Brazil quite disappointing<br>
The team's show very disenchanting,<br>
At the end of each game,<br>
Players traded blame,<br>
And none could stop the `finger pointing'
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Novel Interpretation of 1st line or what ?"</i>
<p>
<I>Hmmm...I don't get it...</I>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The lines following the 1st line assume 
Brazil as in Brazilian soccer team.  Hope 
it makes more sense now."</i>

A pastor in need of a lawyer<br>
Wanted him  to find a Tom Sawyer<br>
"Where was the place<br>
You saw his face?"<br>
"I saw him sitting in a foyer."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I learn so many new words when I write limericks. This is very educational and should be required in school.  What do you think?"</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point thinks that a class on limericks would quickly get out of hand.</I>
<p>
A man once said "I will protest<br>
Against a  newsman I detest<br>
Hired a lawyer<br>
And sued Tom Sawyer<br>
When the man was really Forrest.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Forrest, if you see my limerick, please don't think I don't like you. I think you are one of the best anchormen. Forrest can't sue me, can he?"</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point doesn't think that's a danger.</I>

The crocuses happily blooming<br>
One fresh day were given a grooming<br>
With their new look<br>
The old ground shook<br>
When the irises were booming

As they embrace death,<br>
His business would still be booming.

The crocuses happily blooming<br>
Have put on a face unassuming.<br>
     But though humble they be,<br>
     They're a sure sign to me<br>
That the earth has begun her spring grooming.
<p>
A most delicate  maid from Parsippany<br>
In the art of the chef was the epitome.<br>
She made entrés quite rare<br>
And with other fine fare<br>
Wrapped them up inside crépes of diaphany!

There once was a doc named McLeans<br>
Who exalted in playing with genes--<br>
From black, white, and yellow,<br>
Two girls and a fellow,<br>
He produced a chimaera, then waited for paeans!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, " To a geneticist, a chimaera is an individual
whose cells are mixed in genetic information. Chimaeras are formed by substituting
cells from different individuals in early cleavage stages following fertilization.
Rats with black and white patches of fur were raised from purebred black rats and
purebred white rats by this procedure, many years ago. "</i>

<h3>Cathleen J. Jones writes 04/12/97</h3>
Take note of the colorful carrot-<br>
Soon it will be gnawed  by a parrot<br>
Please don't pick it<br>
Or you'll get bit<br>
And your ring won't be worth one carat!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "   I hope this limerick is better than the first one I submitted. Someone gave me so good advice and hopefully I followed it."</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage likes it, but points out that "carrot" and "carat" is a bit of a cheat, even though they are two different words.</I>

Nope, wanna use my own -<br>
Every verse will be known<br>
Across the web<br>
From March to Feb<br>
Or  be written in stone!

A pastor in need of a lawyer<br>
Was told by one wise Tom Sawyer,<br>
"Sire, Justice is sold,<br>
 Here, take this gold,<br>
Go out and just be the best buyer!"

The crocuses happily blooming<br>
Learnt of the omnipresent glooming,<br>
Immediately they faded,<br>
Into a look jaded,<br>
To welcome the inevitable dooming.<p>

A delicate maid from Parsippany<br>
Was this bee-keeper's daughter funny,<br>
Who could never resist a jive,<br>
And today, in front of a bee-hive,<br>
She danced and yelled "Show me the honey!"

Well, I paid all my taxes, and then<br>
I paid all my bills (there were ten).<br>
"Now I feel very proud,"<br>
And I said this out loud.<br>
Do you think you could lend me a ten?

There once was a guy named Tom<br>
He built an explosive bomb<br>
He blew up a city <br>
But he had no pity<br>
Then was spanked by his mom!

Take note of the colorful carrot<br>
Equally red was my psychic parrot,<br>
Oh I mean only its beak,<br>
Of future it used to speak,<br>
By reading from the cards of tarot.

Ye lovers of satire unite<br>
We must join the ignoramus' plight<br>
It's one way to whet<br>
our desire to get<br>
the follies of man in our sight!

A pastor in need of a lawyer<br>
Exclaimed as he sat in the foyer<br>
I'll be tried (bye and bye)<br>
In those grand courts on high<br>
And not those of Terminer and Oyer!

While Pan capers and pipes<br>

I can't decide - football or soccer?<br>
From a Lazy Boy chair or a rocker?<br>
Ovoid or round?<br>
In the air?  On the ground?<br>
Should I play it?  Or just be a gawker?

And then wanders off into obscure byways that are totally inconsistent

Keep abreast of each tiny detail.<br>

There once was a lassie from Tallahassee<br>
Who swam in the  river called  Tallahatchie<br>
She swam and swam till she saw the moonbeam<br>
Then came a fall and sent her down the stream <br>
She was saved with the hands of a Cherokee.

You know there's some sort of payola<br>

It's way too available<br>
Hell, in Borneo it's saleable<br>
We're the diseased; it's the ebola!

Beer is my only sustainer <br>
We exist on a level coplanar<br>

Then who'll start the bidding?<br>
Surprise me?  I knew you would fold!

A milkmaid addressing her cows<br>
With sweat dripping down from her brows<br>
Caught the eye of a bull<br>
Which started to drool<br>
As he chased her back to her house!

As I rode back from my fair Chalet<br>
The fierce snow, it did blow me away<br>
When I landed at last<br>
My word, how time passed<br>
The snow had been traded for hay.

It really just all makes me vomit<br>
To think of the crew<br>
Swallowing pills and brew<br>
It just was a cult of psychotics.
