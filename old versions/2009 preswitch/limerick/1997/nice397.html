<h3><a href=mailto:Jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 03/27/97</h3>
I wouldn't have missed Hale-Bopp, not on a bet -<br>
The mostest spectacular comet seen yet!<br>
Across the street, one starry night<br>
I went to avoid the bright street light<br>
And also to go just as close to it as I could get!
<hr>

A frat house in rainy Seattle<br>
A daily deluge had to battle<br>
It was no surprise<br>
To see flood waters rise<br>
Up a Greek without a paddle!
<p>
There was a young pig named Sam Handwich<br>
Who met with a dirty old man which<br>
Coverted poor Sam<br>
To plate of sliced ham<br>
And Sam Handwich is now a ham sandwich!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mckenzie@pcanything.com>The Reverend Joseph Blaylock</a> writes 03/24/97</h3>
The Oscars are on the T.V.<br>
But it's of no interest to me;<br>
I sit and I rhyme<br>
Just killing some time<br>
Before my bedtime tea.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Actually, I don't drink tea.  But I do go to bed  at nine-o-clock.  (shrug)"</i>
<p>
I really can't help but to sputter<br>
When thinking of pancakes with butter<br>
With syrupy slime<br>
And jelly some time<br>
Its glorious taste is utter!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Pancakes.  Yum."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Demi-Plume writes 03/24/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
I'm told that in writing poetry, spelling counts<br>
And that rhythm must be measured (by the ounce?)<br>
And that I must use my brain<br>
The words not to strain...<br>
And be certain to rhyme the proper amounts!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:jimf@ohio.net>Inspired</a> writes 03/24/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Enjoying banana-fudge sundaes<br>
On Saturdays, Tuesdays and Mondays<br>
Is a wonderful way<br>
To go fritter away<br>
All of those terrible awful ho-humdays!<br>

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Like it ?  I do!   Have a nice day :)
"</i>

<I>The Sage awwwws....</I>

<h3>Rhubarb shares a classic from the <a href = http://pw1.netcom.com/~pentatet/reply.html>Pentatette </a> archives</h3>
<h4>by A. N. Wilkins</h4>
"The dogwoods we find in the park,"<br>
Explained a professor named Clark, <br>
"Grow all in one plot<br>
And are easy to spot. <br>
We distinguish these trees by their bark."
 <hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:tim@raptor.lpl.arizona.edu>Tim</a> writes 03/21/97</h3>
<I>Tim submitted these below in January, but they never appeared.  Toast Point has never seen them before, so there's a machine out there in the ether that's to blame.  There are more on the <a href=naut397.html>Naughty</a> side, too.</I><p>
Football's the World's favourite game<br>
So why do Yanks try to rip off its name<br>
For a game of their own <br>
Where the ball's carried or thrown<br>
Would anyone care to explain? 
<p>
Ronald McDonald cooks patties<br>
That turns all the Yanks into fatties<br>
Each burger is full<br>
Of cholesterol<br>
And we all know how good for you that is!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
My Mum has Mac II to type letters<br>
But don't mock it or you will upset her<br>
Very out-dated <br>
And quite antiquated<br>
And the computer isn't much better! 

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:apollohollow@msn.com>Crispy</a> writes 03/21/97</h3>
Like flight on a magical rug,<br>
Or getting from lover a hug,<br>
You're so nice to me,<br>
I most sincerely,<br>
Thank you so much for the <a href=#crispy>plug!</a>
<p>
<I>You're welcome!</I>

<h3>Monique de Plume writes 03/20/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Often at night when I'm lying abed<br>
A limerick that's clever just pops in my head.<br>
I chuckle with pleasure<br>
And joy beyond measure<br>
But next day it's gone, and there's nothing instead!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Oh well, they probably weren't that good anyhow!"</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:forshey@zoomnet.net>Montague</a> writes 03/19/97</h3>
A shepherd deprived of much sleep<br>
Thought that cloning utterly reeked<br>
"Big deal," he did cry<br>
With a roll of his eye<br>
"That sheep looks just like that other sheep."

<hr>
<h3>Intell writes 03/19/97</h3>
To Ireland I want to go<br>
With kids and husband in tow<br>
We'll see all the green<br>
And sights to be seen<br>
And fun will be had; this I know.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Thanks for the opportunity to share my dream."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point sighs and would love to go there as well...</I>
<hr>
<h3>Minnie Pearl writes 03/18/97</h3>
There once was this teacher <br>
Who acted like a preacher<br>
When she met this boy<br>
Whose name was Roy<br>
He dyed his hair blue to freak her!

<hr>
<h3>Shorty Rock writes 03/18/97</h3>
One day I did not take a shower<br>
I came across a flower<br>
I said "OH, OH MY!"<br>
And then it died<br>
Next time I'll take a nice hot shower!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This limerick is great!"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Pebbles Rock writes 03/18/97</h3>
There once was a clover that brought luck<br>
Unfortunately, that day it was eaten by a duck<br>
The duck got ill<br>
So he took a pill<br>
And soon he started to gluck!
<p>
<I>Gluck?</I>
<hr>
<h3>Cheeks writes 03/18/97</h3>
A girl who went by the name of Sue<br>
Ran away to live in the zoo<br>
She talked so much<br>
The animals had her for lunch<br>
That was the last we've seen of Sue!
<p>
I knew a boy who was sickly<br>
he went by the name of Ricky<br>
I gave him a piece of candy<br>
He said "Thank you, how dandy!"<br>
And his face and hands were all sticky!

<hr>
<h3>Petit Plume writes 03/18/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I have a grandma who is very smart<br>
I always keep her in my heart<br>
She is very nice<br>
Except when she gives me advice<br>
And her mind is as fast as a dart!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My grandmother is Monique de Plume.  I'm 12 years old.
I thought if my Mom and my Grandmother could do this, I could too..."</i>

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 
03/17/97</h3>
A treasure it's been, that old Abe Lincoln's axe,<br>
But were those who admired it apprised of the facts?<br>
Some handles were new<br>
Some heads replaced too--<br>
By owners who carefully covered their tracks!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A work of fiction, of course."</i>
<p>
A man from a small third-world nation<br>
Believed in a reincarnation.<br>
He worshipped the cat<br>
But came back as a rat<br>
It was to his great consternation!
<hr>
<h3>Stargazer writes 03/14/97</h3>
Yelled my astro professor (named Bob),<br>
"What's the 'three-degree background', you slob?"<br>
I replied, "Sad to say,<br>
Ph.D. to B.A.,<br>
It is no guarantee of a job!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "For more squeaky but geeky physics limericks, see the <a href=http://www.aps.org/apsnews/limericks.html >American Physical
Society limerick contest</a>.</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Monique de Plume writes 03/14/97</h3>
There once was a fella named Lasket<br>
Whose case makes me think of a basket.<br>
Kept his cash in a pail<br>
When it went, did he wail!<br>
If you don't know who took it, don't ask it!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sequel to a famous classic."</i>
<hr>
<h3>John Chastaine writes 03/13/97</h3>
The Lone Ranger was starting to freak!<br>
He hadn't seen Tonto all week.<br>
Tonto called and said, "Kemosabi<br>
I have moved to Abudabi,<br>
And now I am know as a sheik!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A genetic engineer named Jones<br>
Made a large batch of human clones.<br>
It got way out of hand,<br>
The clones started a band,<br>
That features seventy-six trombones!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:PhantomRob@aol.com>Shmendryck</a> writes 03/13/97</h3>
An Israeli boy, living so squalid<br>
That his face became awfully pallid<br>
Knew that to avoid unemployment<br>
And for just his own enjoyment<br>
He should learn his Alefs, Bets, Gimels, & Daleds
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a real Pecksniffian effort at literature...I pretend to be edifying you, but am only looking for a pat on the back.  Forgive me?"</i>
<p>
<I>So sorry, but we're baffled....</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 03/12/97</h3>
Color drained, his face went pale,<br>
He grimaced as he clutched the rail,<br>
Shouted "You, stupid fool!,<br>
Can't you use a simple tool,<br>
I didn't say hammer my finger-NAIL!"
<hr>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Enjoying a banana-fudge sundae<br>
(Before, during or after the entrée)<br>
Is my most well-loved vice,<br>
And I never think twice,<br>
About ordering the three-layer parfait!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I hear there's a new kind of Barbie<br>
Who is dressed up to go on Safari.<br>
   And she's not a cream puff, <br>
   This new doll packs no fluff!<br>
And she's armed with darts dipped in curare!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:akest4+@pitt.edu>The Lieutenant</a> writes 03/11/97</h3>
My love, she is only 19<br>
But she's cute as all cute I have seen<br>
I'd ask her to marry<br>
But to her it's so scary<br>
To commit while she still is so green!
<p>

<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
David Lee Roth is my hero<br>
Even though now he is over 4-0<br>
To me he's still the man<br>
So with a flip of my hand<br>
To him I will drink my last beer-o!
<p>

To always stay close to your pants!

There was once a fair Irish maiden<br>
Who thought one fine day she'd go wadin' <br>
But so sad to tell<br>
She couldn't swim well<br>
O're yonder's the grave she'd laid in.
<p>

In Wisconsin there's cheese and pigs<br>
Tractors and trailers and rigs<br>
Green grass galore<br>
And bars by the score<br>
Where you can find beer, and pigs!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Oops.  I accidentally sent this a couple time unfinished.  To anyone interested, my home page address is:  <a href= http://member.aol.com/JeffK24/JeffKHomePage.html> http://member.aol.com/JeffK24/JeffKHomePage.html</a>.

The home that I love's always breaking!<br>
When I'm away, my heart will be aching<br>
But when I am there<br>
I am making repair<br>
And longing for Tahiti, sun-baking!

<i>The poet comments, "On Monique's suggestion I changed my pen name from "Half-Plume""</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Joe Schmoe writes 03/09/97</h3>
The limerick is a dirty trick<br>
Like a brutish man with rhymed stick<br>
You look for dreaming<br>
And take a creaming<br>
It is all wax and no wick.

<hr>
<h3>John Chastaine writes 03/03/97</h3>
Some Yahoo done drank my Yoohoo!<br>
T'was a nasty dang thing to do.<br>
If I catch that dork,<br>

And  teach that inbred mother who's who!

<h3>Badger's Mom writes 03/02/97</h3>

<h3>Cass A. Nova writes 03/02/97</h3>
When cooking an egg, you must boil it,<br>
And eat it quick to not spoil it .<br>
And in your stomach it stays,<br>
For about two or three days,<br>
Then, sadly, you must flush it down the toilet .
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "One of the saddest things that we face in life is departing from a loved one . This 
is an example of such a solemn occasion ."</i>
