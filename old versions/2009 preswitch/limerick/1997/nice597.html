<h3><a href=mailto:i.o.p.e.design@muenchen.org>IOPE</a> writes 05/30/97</h3>
There was an old man with a face<br>
That bore every possible trace<br>
Of smoking and lottery<br>
Drinking and pottery<br>
He looked like a serious case!
<p>
<I>Drinking and pottery?</I>
<p>
There was an old woman whose ears<br>
Grew twice as big over the years<br>
Bees and flies flew inside<br>
Because they were so wide<br>
And buzzed until she was in tears!
<p>
There was a young lady whose eyes<br>
Were of an extraordinary size<br>
So when she tried hard<br>
She could see every part<br>
Of her head -and I`m telling no lies!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:poetry@coconet.com>David E. Sees</a> writes 05/29/97</h3>
Benjamin Franklin flew a kite in a storm at Fort Pitt<br>
Producing sparks, sputters and even a spit.<br>
Scholars lauded him,<br>
People applauded him,<br>
But Thomas Alva Edison made light of it!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I live here in Fort Myers, Florida, winter home of Edison.  Just had to come up with a limerick about his invention."</i>
<p>
To all  ACLU lawyers, lets give them a big hand<br>
For the principles on which they've decided to stand,<br>
But they dare not breach<br>
The joys of a beach<br>
'Cause cats keep covering them over with sand.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "About half my poems of all kinds are to give people something to laugh about."</i>
<p>
<I>The poet is probably unaware that Toast Point's parents are very active ACLU members.  But we won't hold that against him.</I>

<h3>Prusch writes 05/27/97</h3> 
<h4>Connecticut Love Story</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Wilhelmina from old Willamantic<br>
Had a date with a guy from Niantic<br>
Said he, "Let's repose"<br>
"Without any clothes"<br>
Replied she, "oh my Gawd how romantic!".

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:i luv arlo@aol.com>Kristen Haver</a> writes 05/20/97</h3>
There once was a man named Perry<br>
Who couldn't have any dairy.<br>
Lactose-free milk<br>
He drank on some silk<br>
That covered his house on the prairie.<p>
There once was a pool cleaner man,<br>
His name was Pool Cleaner Dan.<br>
He fell in the pool<br>
And I laughed at the fool<br>
Who drove away wet in his van.
<hr>
<h3>Lo and Behold writes 05/19/97</h3>
I for one haven't paid all my taxes<br>
My wife is still happily shopping at Sach's<br>
When you think how they fudge it<br>
To say we balanced the budget<br>
They may let my minute minus spill
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The spirit's Hi, but the Willis week!!"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point hasn't figured out this at all.  Care to retry, Lo?  Rhyme the last line, at least.</i>
<hr>
<h3>Crispy writes 5/20</h3>
The joy of INEFFABLE thing,<br>
Employing sweet verses to sing,<br>
A thought on your mind,<br>
Almost any kind,<br>
Will light up to limerick's ring!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:JeffK24@aol.com>Jeff Kurfess</a> writes 05/17/97</h3>
In Wisconsin, there's cheese and pigs<br>
Tractors and trailors and rigs<br>
Green grass galore<br>
And bars by the score<br>
Where you can find beer, and pigs!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/17/97</h3>
I have finally paid all my tax.<br>
And they hauled away money in sacks.<br>
(I bamboozled the Fed;<br>
I held on to some bread,)<br>
And I plan to buy more Cracker Jacks.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wonder if two or two hundred people read this.  If you send me Email, I will have a clue. Thanks."</i>
<p>
<I>Write to The Al Willis Get-A-Clue Foundation at his e-mail address above.</I>
<p>
<h4>On Nuclear War</h4>
If there's one thing that I have well learnt,<br>
It's that people detest being burnt.<br>
They don't want to roast,<br>
Or wind up as toast,<br>
And I trust I have made a good pernt.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>Writerman</a> writes 05/17/97</h3>
To get old is to live in obscurity<br>
A life of reflection and purity<br>
As you wither and rot<br>
There's one monthly bright spot---<br>
It's that check from Social Security.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:wrollin@oro.net>Waldo Drull</a> writes 05/15/97</h3>
We all live on a place named Earth<br>
On which billions have been given birth.<br>
It's still very rough-hewn,<br>
To defilement not immune,<br>
Unless everyone develops self-worth.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 05/15/97</h3>
The classy duel was headed for a tie,<br>
But George had won with a trick sly,<br>
As he turned to ack. dins,<br>
Of "Bald wins, Bald wins",<br>
He noticed Alec and William walk by.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Titled "Celebrity Sports, Mud-Pit: George v/s Kramer""</i>
<p>
<I>The alt.showbiz.gossip anti-FAQ has some guidelines on how to tell the four Baldwin brothers apart.  And a good thing, too.</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:esmarelda2@hotmail.com>Emily Kocubinski</a> writes 05/15/97</h3>
There was a man from the jungle<br>
Whose life was a complete bungle.<br>
He cried all the time,<br>
Without reason or rhyme,<br>
Because his foot was all fungal.
<p>
There once was a girl called "The Beast"<br>
Whose skin did not show in the least.<br>
She was covered with hair,<br>
And she smelled like a bear,<br>
So all of her friendships ceased!
<p>
There once was a boy called Bryan<br>
With many dishes to be dryin'.<br>
He complained all the time,<br>
For the dishes had slime,<br>
'Specially when the cook had been fryin'!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:buckeye11@hotmail.com>Buckeye11</a> writes 05/14/97</h3>
There lives a man in BelAir<br>
Who is rapidly losing his hair<br>
His ego is strained<br>
But thank God for Rogaine<br>
His head will no longer be bare!
<hr>
<h3>Lo and Behold writes 05/13/97</h3>
There were two celebrities named Hillary - <br>
Both reached a peak, but one was destined for pillory.<br>
He climbed atop Everest - <br>
Whitewater let her never rest -<br>
Her future faces heavy artillery!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/13/97</h3>
He said, "Boo is still looking for you."<br>
He expected an answer, "Boo who?"<br>
He would say, "Please don't cry."<br>
But things went awry,<br>
And the black man replied, "Who be Boo?"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 05/12/97</h3>
<h4>Image is Nothing</h4>
His e-mails were a stereo-type-cast,<br>
In person, tho', he was a real blast,<br>
When asked why,<br>
Answer came by,<br>
"Oh! I am just an emoticonoclast! "
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Limerick license to create new words used.
Title has nothing to do with
Sprite."</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>KJR writes 05/12/97</h3>
Deep Blue could think longer and faster<br>
Than Kasparov, Russian grandmaster.<br>
After looking ahead,<br>
It solemnly said,<br>
"I forsee a grandmaster disaster!"

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/11/97</h3>
"I do love you; I love you beaucoups.<br>
If you marry me, come to Peru.<br>
I have lots of dough<br>
And a home in Bordeau.<br>
I do! Yes, I do!  Yes, I do!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "But if you're a garbageman......"</i>
<p>
<i>Dough and Bordeau.  For shame.</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:HKleidman@aol.com>Lo and Behold</a> writes 05/10/97</h3>
The crocuses happily blooming<br>
Are a drummer that summertime's looming - <br>
But we're the folks in the faction<br>
That suffers allergic reaction<br>
We hope crocuses croak without pluming!
<hr>
<h3>Nathaniel Pulkrabek writes 05/09/97</h3>
I was alone at home eating spam<br>
(We were all out of ham)<br>
When I was done <br>
Having my fun,<br>
I had to go wash the pan!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Tell your friends about me!"</i>
<p>
<i>We have.  They're frightened now.</i>  :)
<hr>
<h3>Dylan Van Seegopaul writes 05/09/97</h3>
I saw this guy in his car<br>
He was on his way to a bar<br>
He had a few beers<br>
Killed eleven deers<br>
And was punished by the czar!

<hr>
<h3>Monique de Plume rewrites 05/08/97</h3>
A good egg named Humpty once straddled a wall<br>
And told to decide on the right side to fall<br>
Said, "Sure it depends on the way that I sit,<br>
For if I turn around it's the opposite<br>
So I wonder if really there's a right side at all!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Assuming Toast Point and the Sage are both right about my May 7 effort,
and with some contrition about the lack of scanscion of the first edition,
this is a quick rewrite. Not perfect, but better, I hope. Please feel free
to edit!"</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage attempts to squeeze Ms. de Plume's marvelous story into limerical form:<br></i>
An egg (Humpty), straddling a wall,<br>
Deciding the right side to fall,<br>
"It depends how I sit -<br>
Turning round, it's opposite - <br>
Is there really a right side at all?"
<p>
<i>Metrically correct (mostly), but nearly as charming as the original.</i>
<hr>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There's a NiP in the Air, LuV, TiNiTe,<br>
And I hope it won't snOW, but it might.<br>
If it isn't SO BiTTEr,<br>
We'll call up the SiTTEr,<br>
And we CaN go OUTe for a BiTe.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "How many elements can you identify?"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Lisa the Limericker writes 05/04/97</h3>
They put my old man in the zoo!<br>
There was nothing I really could do.<br>
He would stand on his head<br>
'Til his face turned all red - <br>
I visit from nine until two.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 05/04/97</h3>
There once was a convict named Gleim<br>
Who tended some herbs to atone for his crime.<br>
The garlic had too strong a scent<br>
So on to the onions he went<br>
Then weeded and cried 'til the end of thyme!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Can't resist a pun."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:johnyrandy@prodigy.com>Johnyrandy</a> writes 05/03/97</h3>
When the Brits chose the slick Tony Blair,<br>
With his saccharine smile and coiffed hair,<br>
Said a moody John Major,<br>
"You've made a mad wager<br>
You'll need more than a hope and a prayer!"<p>
In a pub I once met two fun barmen<br>
One was gross and the other one charmen<br>
But I had a conniption<br>
When they sang in Egyptian<br>
A dirge to the great Tutankhamen.
<p>
<i>The poet comments:<br>
Q. What do you get when you cross a Sumo wrestler with a lady Egyptian railroad conductor ?<br> 
A. A two ton carman.</i>
<p>
<I>Why a <u>lady</u> railroad conductor?</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/03/97</h3>
When I'm troubled and call 911,<br>
I expect some fast service, bar none.<br>
But I got an airhead,<br>
And this the voice said:<br>
"If someone was killed, please press one."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:HKleidman@aol.com>Lo and Behold</a> writes 05/03/97</h3>
 At last, a memorial to Franklin Roosevelt <br>
Who did so well with the cards he got dealt.<br>
The Depression when he was new<br>
To the scourge of World War II<br>
He may have bent but he never knelt!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 05/02/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A centipede, shopping for clothes,<br>
Decided to buy some nice hose.<br>
She said, "These look nifty,"<br>
"I'll take about fifty,<br>
And those, yes, and those, yes, and those!"
<hr>
<h3>Lisa the Limericker writes 05/02/97</h3>
They said I was having a baby - <br>
A day later and still in la-by<br>
It was a success!<br>
My child is the best!<br>
As for more, I need not say maybe.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:neilf@cs.itc.hp.com>Limerick Man</a> writes 05/02/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
 When you're dating today, there is strife.<br>
You just don't know how fate rules your life.<br>
You could end up like me,<br>
In a quandry, you see,<br>
With my first girlfriend's husband's ex-wife!
<p>

Michael Jackson and Lisa were wed.<br>
But my question pertains to their bed:<br>
Did that oxygen bubble<br>
Give Lisa much trouble?<br>
How romantic was, "Oops, watch your head!"?
<p>
Now that Michael and Lisa have split,<br>
I do wonder just why she did quit.<br>
Maybe all of their trouble<br>
Started under that bubble.<br>
Or perhaps she would not babysit!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
If my job was the best it could be,<br>
I would test ev'ry beach by the sea.<br>
I would spend sev'ral days<br>
Near the surf, catching rays<br>
And go swimming, of course, for a fee!
<p>
There's a lesson that we should be learning<br>
With the hot days of summer returning:<br>
Get some sun block applied<br>
When you're tanning outside.<br>
If you don't, you may find, something's burning!
<p>
The two Perrier trucks broken down<br>
Clogged the busiest highway in town.<br>
In the heat, this was certain:<br>
Neither driver was hurtin'.<br>
For their thirst they could easily drown!
<p>
While the World Cup in soccer's contested,<br>
I can sit on my couch and be rested.<br>
But the soccer's so boring<br>
That I soon end up snoring<br>
With my dinner completely digested!
<p>
If you're wondering, "How is the weather<br>
When mountains and clouds come together?"<br>
The winds and the sleet<br>
Knock you right off your feet<br>
If you're not held secure with a tether!
<P>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There's a zoo with a baby gorilla<br>
Whose name on the form needs a filla.<br>
I submit that the name<br>
Should be worthy of fame:<br>
Name him Elvis! (unless he's Priscilla).
<p>
I think Limerick Man sure is neato.<br>
Not well known, though, like L.A.'s judge Ito.<br>
But if he became famous<br>
Like cookie-man Amos,<br>
Would he still try to stay incognito?
<p>
If you're granted three wishes, be clever!<br>
As for me, I would make an endeavor<br>
To get shortcake when shopping,<br>
And, along with whipped topping,<br>
Live in Strawberry Fields Forever!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
I will bet I can rhyme them with ease.<br>
There's GAZILLIONs of words that will please.<br>
It seems quite elementary<br>
To rhyme ROCKUMENTARY.<br>
And a SLACKER will often say, "SHEEZE!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A local radio station asked listeners to try to use the four new words
added to Webster's dictionary in a poem..."</i>
<p>
When those Pepsi folks offered the Harrier,<br>
Getting points wasn't even a barrier.<br>
Now my order is placed<br>
And I'm waiting, in haste,<br>
For the battleship, sub, and the carrier!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Refers to the man who said he's acquired enough Pepsi label points to
receive the Harrier jet shown as a joke in their commercial.  He was
going to take Pepsi to court to get the fighter, supposedly."</i>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A government under John Major<br>
Was so soundly beaten, I'll wager<br>
'Cos the Tories he led<br>
Were too often in bed<br>
Giving tabloids a sleazy front-pager!

Were I a black Irish, la-la<br>
My beauty'd be increased by far.<br>
But even if black,<br>
I'd still have a lack<br>
Of youth, which is sine non qua!
