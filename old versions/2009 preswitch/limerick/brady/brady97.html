Brady Bunch Limericks</H1>
<h2>Here's the story...of a bunch named Brady...</h2>
That squeaky-clean family, the Bradys<br>
Were sent to us straight out of Hades<br>
Their suburban palace<br>
And housekeep named Alice<br>
All serve to make Toast Point a Fraidy!<p>

Mike Brady the ladies do say<br>
Likes sex 2 times every day!<br>
But he meant no malice<br>
When he knocked up Alice - <br>
He explained, "She was an incredible lay!"

<h3><a href=mailto:mistmurf@bellatlantic.net>Murfdog</a> writes 11/30/97</h3>
When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
She was watched by her sister Jan<br>
Who herself could not get a man<br>
So she played with her cones<br>
And imagined Bobby pumping her bones.
<p>
<i>Oh, Murfdog, it's AABBA, not ABBAA.  (that's ABBA Anonymous).</i>

<h3>Dirt Bag Joe writes 11/29/97</h3>
Though Marsha's bathroom door had a lock,<br>
When pissing, little Bobby would flock.<br>
He'd look and he'd see,<br>
Marsha taking a pee.<br>
All while stroking his cock.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:kjd@myna.com>Jan's Revenge</a> writes 11/22/97</h3>
Here's a story that really ain't too nice<br>
If you now saw the cast, you'd look twice<br>
Now Carol's got money<br>
And Jan is a honey<br>
And the house is infested with mice!

<hr>
<h3>Swordfish writes 11/21/97</h3>
Mike Brady worked hard every day<br>
But his wife didn't know he was gay<br>
It was Greg who had taught him <br>
Then Carol had caught him<br>
With Bobby's young "peter" at play!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
When Carol was fucking with Mike,<br>
There was something that she didn't like<br>
She was sick of his phallus<br>
So she paired off with Alice<br>
And had sex with that wrinkled old dyke!
<p>
There once was a Brady named Greg<br>
To Marcia for sex he would beg<br>
For he's not enough man<br>
For Cindy or Jan,<br>
But Tiger loved humping his leg!
<p>
A horny young Brady named Peter<br>
Hiked Cindy's skirt and tried to eat her<br>
She cried out with a lisp<br>
So he curled up his fist<br>
Knocked her down on the floor and he beat her.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Bobby, the youngest male Brady<br>
Spent time with a man rather shady<br>
For Bobby, he'd dance<br>
Without any pants<br>
While Bobby watched, dressed like a lady! 
<p>
Marcia Brady went out on a date<br>
She was to not come home too late<br>
She arrived home quite sick<br>
Not from sucking a dick<br>
But from 3 horny lesbians she ate!
<p>
A young Brady daughter named Jan<br>
Never had a date with a man<br>
But she got her 1st chance<br>
At the school's springtime dance<br>
She was raped by eight guys in a van!
<p>
Cindy Brady at the Christmas store<br>
Sat on Santa's lap like before<br>
Santa forced his "north pole"<br>
In her tight little hole<br>
And now Cindy don't lisp anymore!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Alice the housekeeping Ma'am<br>
Was dating a butcher named Sam.<br>
But Sam'd rather bowl<br>
Cause Alice's hole<br>
Reminded him too much of SPAM!
<p>
<i>Well, that about covers them all, doesn't it?</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:kjd@myna.com>Alice in Vonderland</a> writes 11/20/97</h3>
The Brady Bunch story is untrue<br>
The children now grown up may rob you<br>
And Carol can't sing<br>
And Cindy's a thing<br>
And Mike is now deader than discue!
<p>
<i>discue?</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:cool_cindy@hotmail.com>CrystaL</a> writes 11/14/97</h3>
The kids' bathroom toilet is missing<br>
So we wondered where Greg had been pissing<br>
He said on his hand,<br>
On the ground, in the sand<br>
So the question is "where did it go missing?"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:jonhurley@hotmail.com>Jonhurley</a> writes 11/04/97</h3>
Greg Brady, who came from Cape Horn<br>
Wished he had never been born.<br>
And he wouldn't have been<br>
If his father had seen<br>
That the end of the rubber was torn!
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 10/22/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
I hate the whole damned Brady Bunch<br>
And I have quite a nasty wee hunch<br>
That when Sam sees Alice<br>
She fondles his phallus<br>
Then goes down on Carol for lunch!

<hr>
<h3>Lanacane writes 09/26/97</h3>
In the Brady family, all were tight<br>
And the little kids tried with all of their might<br>
Not to become like Marsha and Greg<br>
Seen with his head between her legs<br>
What do they say? Looks like incest is the best!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bcwbcw@aol.com>Buck</a> writes 09/09/97</h3>
While mowing the Astroturf lawn,<br>
Greg noticed it took much too long<br>
So he said to Alice<br>
(Intending no malice)<br>
"Earn your keep or I'll see that you're gone!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:aly517@atlcom.net>Alyson Sugarman</a> writes 09/09/97</h3>
Is Alice a bulldyke or what?<br>
And, what's up with Tiger, the mutt?<br>
The whole family's nuts<br>
Even Greg's smoking butts,<br>
I wonder if they're related to King Tut.

<p>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Is Alice a bulldyke or what?<br>
She can nail a 40-foot putt.<br>
She can kick Tyson's ass,<br>
Land a 50-pound bass,<br>
While a dildo is stuck up her butt!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "When Alice reads this she'll probably kick MY butt."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 08/02/97</h3>
When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
We were treated to orgasmic groans.<br>
It's the last Clarkesville train<br>
They screwed out Marcia's brain<br>
And she claims she loves all of their bones!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yes, the Monkees said it all.  They do monkey around."</i>

<h3>Megarator writes 06/13/97</h3>
Bobby & Cindy could think of no better<br>
Way to break a Guinness Book Record<br>
Than to see-saw in the yard,<br>
God knows its not hard,<br>
But it kept them from being bed-wetters!
<p>
Cindy cried, "My doll Kitty Karry ith mithing!"<br>
but no one got it because of her lisping<br>
(plus Carol & Alice were on tranqs)<br>
Cindy blamed Bobby for the prank<br>
but Tiger the dog had done all the snitching!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Greg thinks that all men drive better,<br>
But Marcia's a feminist go-getter!<br>
On a cone balances the egg -<br>
Who'll break it?  Her or Greg?<br>
In the end, Greg's egg is for batter fit better!

<h3><a href=mailto:brickman.2@osu.edu>Stiffy Joe</a> writes 04/05/97</h3>
Here's the story of a lovely lady<br>
Whose sexual past is somewhat shady<br>
She's mothered three girls<br>
The youngest with curls<br>
And now copulates with Mike Brady!

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 04/04/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
If Mike Brady would have been thinkin'<br>
I'm sure that he could have been sinkin'<br>
His well-polished phallus<br>
To the hilt into Alice<br>
Had he not been scared of Cindy finkin'!

<hr>
<h3>Brigadoony-Loony-Toony writes 04/01/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Now Mike was a good architect<br>
But he had trouble getting erect<br>
Until Marcia implored<br>
About his dick unexplored<br>
And obliged a good suck of his peck!

<hr>
<h3>Cousin Oliver's Sister Lisa writes 04/01/97</h3>
Here's the story of a brood of Bradies<br>
With four perm-headed guys and four ladies - <br>
There's sisters who bicker<br>
And brothers who trick her<br>
This would just never work in the eighties!
<hr>
<h3>Summers writes 03/28/97</h3>
Is Carol's hair really that flip?<br>
One day she went on a trip<br>
And did fall and get a big rip<br>
She did flip<br>
No more going on a trip!
<p>
<I>The Sage frowns and points Summers towards the <a href=../docs/formhint.html>Hints on Limerick Structure</a>.</I>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
A chill went straight to her bones!<br>
For there in his pants<br>
Rose a really good chance<br>
That they'd share a couple good moans!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "C'mon guys... You know Marcia's a slut.
"</i>

<h3>Barl Eardley writes 02/24/97</h3>
There once was a family named Brady<br>
Two trollops, a whore and a lady<br>
One trollop would suck<br>
The other would fuck<br>
While the whore tongued the lady named Sadie.

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 02/17/97</h3>
Sam had found his soul mate in fair Alice.<br>
Daily drank from her twat, like a chalice.<br>
And his favorite mixture<br>
from that feminine fixture?<br>
Blood and jism, stirred twice with his phallus.
<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 02/11/97</h3>
When Greg moved up into the attic<br>
Mike and Carol gave poor Greg some static.<br>
But they finally gave in<br>
And Greg started to grin<br>
Now autoerotic would become automatic!

<hr>

The kids' bathroom toilet is missing,<br>
Greg and Marcia are kissing, <br>
Carol is the head lady<br>
In the family whose last name is Brady<br>
The family the entire neighborhood is dissing!

<h3><a href=mailto:scarras@aol.com>Steve Carras</a> writes 01/22/97</h3>
Greg and Marcia sitting in a tree.<br>

Then comes marriage.<br>
