Pope takes the "Current Events" category:</h3>
<h4>(and sweeps this category in the Squeaky-Clean section, too!)</h4>

His cause has effect: it's the sack.

<h3><IMG SRC = "../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" ALT = "Gold Star!"  ALIGN = right>
The "Pun" Award goes to Pearl B. Sheridan for:</h3>
A poet, poor son of a bitch,<br>

<hr>
<h3><IMG SRC = "../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" ALT = "Gold Star!"  ALIGN = right>
<a name="skates">The winner for "Oddest Mental Picture"</a> is Andrew, who writes:</h3>

And practically useless on dates!

<h3><IMG SRC = "../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" ALT = "Gold Star!"  ALIGN = right>
The "Foreign Affairs" trophy goes to Glenn Calvin for:</h3>
There once was a man of Morocco<br>

<hr>
<h3><IMG SRC = "../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" ALT = "Gold Star!"  ALIGN = right>
Buster wins in the "Prowess" category with:</h3>
A decent young fellow named Herm<br>
Was equipped with a geyser-like worm:<br>

That his lovers did backstroke in sperm.
<hr>
<h3><IMG SRC = "../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" ALT = "Gold Star!"  ALIGN = right>
The elegantly-named Saffonda Cox wins the "Discretion" award:</h3>
Were you a more elegant chap,<br>
I'd ask to sit down on your lap<br>
Cross-legg'd, like a swami<br>
For 'hide the salami',<br>
But it seems that you're ill with the clap.
<hr>
<h2>Dishonorable Mention</h2>
<h3>Mr. Wine shares a classic 8/28</h3>
There once was a woman named Alice<br>
Who pissed in the archbishop's chalice<br>
She later decreed<br>
That she did it from need<br>
And not out of Protestant malice.
<p>
<a name="mrwine">Mr. Wine</a> also submitted the following variation on <a href=#glenn>Glenn Calvin's</a> 
<i>stormy weather</i> limerick:<br>
There once was a man from Dooglass<br>
Whose balls were made of spun glass...<br>
<hr>
<h3>kathiw@innet.com writes 8/27</h3>
A young man deprived of young women<br>
Did visit a whorehouse in Drimmin<br>
When he walked in the joint<br>
Went direct to Toast Point<br>
You could say that his butter was brimmin'!<br>
<b>Note from Toast Point</b> - <i>it was a temp job!  Honest!</i><br>
<b>Note from <a href=http://innet.com/~kathiw>Kathi</a></b> - <i>No, no, it's a reference to the point at which 
"toast is done"!</i><br>
<b>Note from Toast Point</b> - <i>Oops...</i>
<hr>
<h3>Al Willis writes 8/24</h3>
He played show and tell with his Pam<br>
He showed her what looked like a yam.<br>
Then, in a flash, she<br>
Said, "This came from the sea."<br>
And she showed him her bearded clam.<br>
<p>
The mounted cop on his beat<br>
With his horse, tried to be most discreet.<br>
But the horse couldn't stop it,<br>
He just had to drop it,<br>
On that odoriferous street.
<hr>
<h3>Jonathon writes 8/23</h3>
The sex act's a curious thing<br>
It's a "bang", "tryste", "boff" or a "fling",<br>
A "schtup","ball" or "fuck"<br>
Are all ways to say "fuck<br>
Her 'joy box' with your "ding-a-ling'"<br>
<i>Note from the Sage</i> - Jonathon is respectfully requested 
to submit two <i>different</i> words 
that rhyme for lines 3 and 4.
<hr>
<h3><a name="glenn">Glenn Calvin</a>, Prescott Arizona!! shares a classic 8/17</h3>
(and <a href=#mrwine>Mr. Wine</a> offered a variation)<br>
There once was a man from Madrass<br>
Whos balls were constructed of brass<br>
He clanged them together<br>
They played "Stormy Weather"<br>
And lightning shot out of his ass.<p>
<p>
<h3>and writes, with Jeannen Napolitano</h3>
There once was a man with one nut<br>
Who found himself in a large rut.<br>
When he'd screw missionary,<br>
He'd become rather wary<br>
Of losing it up his girl's butt.
<hr>
<h3>mozowin@icon-stl.net writes 8/15</h3>
I see by the size of your member<br>
That you were born in September<br>
If I looked at your nose<br>
I could tell how it goes<br>
But maybe I won't remember
<hr>
<h3>Sam Morrison writes 8/15</h3>
There once was a man named Clagg.<br>
Who fell in love with a hag.<br>
When asked why,<br>
He looked at his fly.<br>
And said it's better than being a fag.<br>
<i>Toast Point looks offended.  "Don't knock it..."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Bill Wolcott writes 8/15</h3>
Bill was a young blade of sort<br>
Whose dick was remarkably short<br>
When he got in bed<br>
His gay friend said<br>
This isn't a dick...it's a wart<br>
<i>Toast Point remarks..."Autobiography?"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Raunchy writes 8/13</h3>
If you really like sucking a cock<br>
You'd better not look at the clock<br>
'Cause sucking takes time<br>
And if it is mine<br>
I'll shoot it off like a glock
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous shares a classic 8/12</h3>
There once was a man from Arass<br>
Who spread himself out on the grass.<br>
With no little trouble, <br>
He bent himself double,<br>
And stuck his prick well up his ass.
<hr>
<h3>Ed Hirsch writes 8/11</h3>
There once was a man named McNall,<br>
Who had these magnificent balls<br>
Said a woman he knows,<br>
"Hey what good are those,<br>
When your dick is as flat as the walls?"
<hr>
<h3>dstark@eznet.net writes 8/10</h3>
There once was a fellow from Venus<br>
Whose head had the shape of a penis.<br>
Said he, "If you please,<br>
Since they don't help me breathe,<br>
No condom should come in between us."

<hr>
<h3>Buster writes 8/8</h3>
The bulldyke once said to the femme,<br>
"Quit your lusting ad hominem.<br>
I'm queer and you're free.<br>
And this dildo you see?<br>
Up your bum it will go greased with phlegm."
<p>
Said Chloe effecting a schism,<br>
"I'm seeing as though through a prism:<br>
Those groans that I heard<br>
As the world became blurred<br>
Imply that my head's drenched with jism."
<hr>
<h3>Diana Prince writes 8/2</h3>
I see by the size of your member<br>
You're as hot as a blazing coal ember!<br>
So slicken that mast -<br>
And hon, make it fast -<br>
This girl's not been poked since December!
<HR>
<h3>Elsa Champion writes 8/1</h3>
My pussy is big, black and furry<br>
And toothy, which makes my men worry<br>
But gently I soothe them<br>
It only chews 'em<br>
If they're in too much of a hurry!
