Cochrane, Shapiro, F. Lee<br>
As slick as three lawyers can be<br>
They persuaded the jury,<br>
To take out its fury<br>
On Fuhrman, and set O.J. free.<br>

<a name="Govindhan"><H3>Govindhan Padmavijayam tells the Sage a thing or two 10/18</H3></a>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
This is a friendly piece of advice to the "sage"<br>
"throw those scissors", do'nt incur my rage<br>
a neatly worded limerick<br>
can be clean, naughty and caustic<br>
"Don't edit!", even if I mail in garbage !<p>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>Gar-bayge?</i>

<h3>A poet who might be Arthur writes 10/2</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
I've researched my own family tree;<br>
It's impressive, I'm sure you'll agree.<br>
The chart, though immense,<br>
Will, with effort, condense:<br>
"From Cheetah to Tarzan to me."

<hr>



<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
<h3>Gary submits a non-limerick 10/26</h3>
I used to find my piece of mind sitting in a tree<br>
Then one day someone cut it down, it fell atop of me<br>
So if you are wandering through the woods looking for a frog, <br>
You might find my piece of mind underneath a log.

<h3>MJM writes 10/26</h3>
Said Los Angeles D.A. Garcetti,<br>
The defense was a bowl of spaghetti,<br>
Thrown up on the wall,<br>
To see what won't fall.<br>
Justice turned into confetti.
<p>
Govindhan Padmavijayam,<br>
Can't write a limerick worth a damn.<br>
Most of the time,<br>
They don't even rhyme.<br>
Who's the only worse poet, I am.<p>
<b>The Sage would disapprove of a limerick flame war.  Toast Point 
would be amused.</b>

<H3>Conan the Librarian shares a classic 10/17</H3>
An epicure dining at Crewe<BR>
Found quite a large mouse in his stew.<BR>
Said the waiter, "Don't shout<BR>
And wave it about, <BR>
Or the rest will be wanting some too."

<hr>
<H3>Govindhan Padmavijayam writes 10/17</H3>
There once lived a radio operator named Giovinda<BR>
Who hailed from an interior part of India<BR>
The captain thought he was real class<BR>
And lo! when the ship was in distress<BR>
All Govinda did was to send a dit and a dah !
<P>

There once lived a giant blue whale<BR>
Which ol' Bill put up for a discount sale<BR>
No one did ever come forward to buy<BR>
And he was the laughing stock of the passers-by<BR>
All they asked was "Bill, is the whale male or female"?

<h3>Wind Runner shares a classic something-or-other 10/17</h3>
There once was a young lass from Nantucket<br>
Who did her dirty laundry in a bucket<br>
But the wind came one day and blew her laundry all away<br>
So she threw up her hands and said<br>
Oh Pooh!

<hr>
<h3>Big Rich shares a classic 10/14</h3>
There once was a lady named Bright,<br>
Who could travel faster than light.<br>
She left one day<br>
In a relative way<br>
And came home the previous night!
<hr>
<h3>Brandy Olson writes 10/13</h3>
There once was a man named gordon<br>
Who was certainly good at hoardin'<br>
But his most favorite things<br>
Were endangered with wings<br>
Until he was caught by the warden.

<hr>
<h3>J0yce writes 10/12</h3>
A hurricane by the name of Opal<br>
Took Gulf Shores something awful!!<br>
Ruined  a property of mine,<br>
(It was one of a kind!!)<br>
And adjusters say, "It is a total!!"
<hr>

<h3>Chauncey von Blatnik de Grope, Jr. writes</h3>
When seafood's a dish you are craving<br>
And your talent lies in repaving<br>
Lay your dish in the road <br>
Till there's white lines on yer choad<br>
"Now that's one schrod that ain't misbehavin' ! "<br>
<hr>
<h3>The Blundell's Poetry Group, Tiverton, England writes 10/1</h3>
A schoolteacher - Harriet Moss<br>
Turned up for her class with her boss<br>
To bring the headmaster<br>
Turned out a disaster<br>
Since his suit was such a dead loss<br>
<p>
   and...
<p>
A horror of pink cotton candy<br>
When down at the beach, gets all sandy<br>
Often melts in the sun<br>
And congeals into one - <br>
Continued ib next fortnight's Dandy
<p>
<b>Note from Toast Point</b> - typo here?  Last line confusing to one such as I.

<h3>Jack Skellington writes 10/1</h3>
All Hallow's Eve is so scary<br>
So small boys and girls, please be wary<br>
Of corpses all bloody<br>
And mummies all muddy<br>
And werewolves with paws big and hairy!
