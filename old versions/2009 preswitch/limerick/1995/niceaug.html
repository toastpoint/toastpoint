<h2><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align=right>Wumpus writes on our 7th luniversary</h2>
<h4>There once lived a Toast Point in Queens<br>
Who came up with most fabulous screams<br>
He screamed and he plotted<br>
For a Wumpus he wanted<br>
To complete his most wondrous of dreams!</h4>
<b>Note from Toast Point</b> - <i>Ooohhhh....</i>

<h2>The Winners for August, All of Whom are Pure at Heart</h2>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
His Peace takes the "Sports" award with:</h3>
There once was a young man from Lyme<br>
Who scored a goal for the very first time!<br>
The young man was glad <br>
But his teammates were sad <br>
'Cause he hadn't changed sides at half time!
<hr>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Pope takes the "Current Events" category</a></h3>
<h4>(which he also took in the Naughty section - go figure)</h4>
Dick Armee named Barney a fag<br>
As smooth as saluting a flag;<br>
Whether slip or design<br>
It was less than benign<br>
And suggested his bent as a wag.
<hr>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Our winner in the "D&D" category is Steven Han:</a></h3>
There was a plump knight named Sir Keith<br>
Who removed his sword from its sheath<br>
He fought for his honor<br>
But soon was a goner<br>
And the dragon stood picking his teeth.
<hr>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Sister Mary Margaret Peter Norton makes the Catholic Church proud with:</h3>
There once was a nun from Nantucket<br>
Hid skimmed alms for more RAM in a bucket<br>
Prayed while down on her knees<br>
"Can't those SIMMs grow on trees?<br>
No more theft - make that tree - then I'll pluck it!"<p>

<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align=right><a name="victoria">
Victoria wrote both of these winners, sweeping the "Computer" category:</a></h3>
A computer is just a machine.<br>
You could never call it obscene.<br>
So if you turn red,<BR>
From words that it said,<BR>
It's YOU who knows what they mean...
<P>
Eight bits or two nibbles, a byte...<BR>
It's like lunch. Hey that works! Well, it might<BR>
But bytes by the bunch<BR>
Make words. If that's lunch,<BR>
Then machines eat their words, ain't that right?<BR>
<hr>
<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
<h3>His Peace writes 8/23</h3>
There once was a parrot named Huey,<br>
Who said,"The poems on this page are all phooey,<br>
When you say them, your lips<br>
Do somersaults and backflips<br>
And end up all crumpled up at St. Louis."

<hr>
<h3>Charles K Watkins</h3>
We all should know that a limerick<br>
Is a psycological gimmerick<br>
Through our defenses it peels<br>
'Til our psyche it reveals<br>
And we laugh at ourselves 'til we hemorrhage<p>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - this is lovely, until the last line, 
where there is no rhyme.  May I suggest something on the order of...<br>
<i>And we laugh until seen as a lunatic.</i>?  <br>
Not great, but closer.
<hr>
<h3>Pope writes 8/11</h3>
A cuddle of butter, named Newty,<br>
Had always been judged kind of fruity,<br>
But then he gained power,<br>
Perfected his glower<br> 
In a table-turn yuk, way too hooty.
<hr>
<h2>Special Mention</h2>
<h3>Sister Mary Margaret Peter Norton writes 8/6</h3>
There was an old hermit named Dave,<BR>
Who kept a nun chained in his cave,<BR>
The Lord interceded - <BR>
Gave the nun what she needed,<BR>
Made Dave both her  <A HREF = ../wumpus.html>Wumpus</A> and slave.<p>
<b>Note:</b> - the original of this (with graphics!) is located on the 
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jd23/limerick.html>Cybernun</a> page.  
Toast Point is delighted that his <A HREF = ../wumpus.html>Wumpus</A> 
is getting the recognition he deserves.
