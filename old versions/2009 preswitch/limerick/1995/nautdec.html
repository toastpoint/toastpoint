<h3>Anonymous submits <u>the</u> classic 12/31</h3>
There once was a man from Nantucket<br>
Whose dick was so long he could suck it<br>
As he said with a grin <br>
As he wiped off his chin<br>
If his ear were a cunt, he would fuck it!

<h3>Ricardo submits a classic 12/30</h3>

And lightning shot out of his ass.

Cute triplets named Nat, Tat and Pat;<br>

<h3>Barrie Collins writes 12/27</h3>
There once was a hermaphrodite<br>
Who said, "Please don't pity my plight.<br>

I can do it!  And do it all night!

A.E. Newman</a> submits a classic naughty poem 12/26</h3>
There once was a man named Nick<br>
And he could perform such a wonderful trick<br>
He'd coat his ass with butter<br>
And then insert his dick<br>
He didn't do it for pleasure, <br>
Nor fame you could put on a shelf<br>
He did it to please an old buddy <br>
Who'd told him "Go fuck yourself"!

"I like anal sex, if you please"<br>

"I'm firm and I'm tight,<br>
I'm an utter delight!<br>
And I promise that I won't cut the cheese!"

<h3>The Ghost who writes writes 12/24</h3>
Miss Haverford on her veranda<br>
Often stood with the utmost candor<br>
There many an hour<br>
When things went sour<br>
She'd quietly do it with her panda!

<h3>Charlotte writes 12/24</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Her face was as red as the light<br>
That shown in the window at night<br>
This poor working girl<br>
Was new at the whirl<br>
Though eager to please and excite.
<p>
The Hardy Boys, on an adventure<br>
Both wanted to land in her center.<br>
They opened her legs<br>
Inserted their pegs<br>
And debauched the young lass magenta!
<p>
The thought of Stan's touch was enough<br>
To make the young girl rub her muff.<br>
But stroke as she may<br>
She longed just to say,<br>
"Do it harder.  I'm no powder-puff."

<hr>
<h3>Charlotte writes 12/23</h3>
There once was a maiden so fair<br>
The men would all wish she would bare.<br>
She offered to Stan<br>
That he be her man<br>
But he wouldn't or won't pay the fare!
<p>
There once was a man so horny<br>
He couldn't say anything corny.<br>
He said, "I'm not jokin'.<br>
I'm due for some pokin'.<br>
Come play with my thang so thorny."

Stan the Man</a> writes 12/23</h3>
Ginger was known for her gas<br>
Which on occasion, she'd silently pass<br>
But when she let one rip<br>
It would rock the whole ship<br>
And knock those nearby on their ass
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
At giving head, Ginger's the best!<br>
Her blow jobs could pass every test!<br>

With her lips or her gum,<br>
Or use both with unparalleled zest!

A poet who might be Martin Wellborn</a> writes 12/22</h3>
I've a fetish that nobody knows.<br>
It's kissing between ladies' toes.<br>
When I've asked a miss<br>
'Tween which toes to kiss,<br>
It's always been big toes she chose.

To Stan, Ginger whined and then sighed<br>
Her vibrator battery died<br>
She got off instead<br>
With ten minutes of head,<br>
Then she gave Stan's old willie a ride!
<P>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Ginger's bush was a true work of art<br>
It was coifed in the shape of a heart<br>
And just out of sight<br>

A twat with the taste of a tart!

Ginger</a> writes 12/21</h3>
Her butt in the air looked so fair<br>
He wondered if he'd ever dare.<br>
To approach her he must.<br>
He was so full of lust.<br>
That Stan made her bottom show bare!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Stan was glad he'd begun this affair<br>
As he bent Charl over the chair.<br>
With her legs spread apart<br>
He could see that this tart<br>
Was his favorite dessert, his eclair.
<p>
This fellow named Stan was so grand<br>
Fems flocked from all over the land.<br>
They all wanted a peek.<br>
Even better, a tweek.<br>
And a chance to be under his hand.

<h3>Reeshard submits a revolting classic...</h3>
There was a girl from Azores<br>

As she walked down the street<br>
Not even the dogs would eat<br>
The green meat that hung from her drawers.
<p>

Ginger from County of Dade<br>
Said, "I think it's time I got laid."<br>
"My vibrator can tingle"<br>
"But it's not cunnilingual"<br>
"And that's how orgasms are made."
<p>
Ginger was feeling quite gruff<br>
Till he placed his head in her muff<br>
Then she purred like a kitty<br>
When his tongue hit her clitty<br>
Saying, "I just can't get enough!"

<h3>Alabaster Cat writes 12/20</h3>

While loaded from drinking some scotch,<br>
Charl shaved all the hair from her crotch<br>
She now goes to work in<br>
A henna-hued merkin<br>
That matches the face of her Swatch.<p>

contention for Naughty Limerick of the Year.</b><p>

Ginger's henna-hued merkin was rare<br>
It was made of natural hair<br>
It covered her quiff<br>
From her ass to midriff<br>
And was parted in the middle for air!

His romance is beyond comprehension,<br>
Perhaps because of his dimension.<br>
The women succumb - <br>
Indeed they all cum -<br>
And they always give Stan special mention!

Stan realizes I love to play.<br>
Yes, I'd be his Sub anyday.<br>
This Illinois fellow<br>
Can make me feel mellow.<br>
Brings me to my knees to obey.

So instead of cumming he went...

Xeroo, a creature of cyber-space,<br>

<h3>and comments on Tim Robinson's entries below 12/11</h3>

A poet sending poems to you<br>
Should give credit where credit is due.<br>
   It's my sincere belief<br>
   That Timmy's a thief<br>
For pretending his classics are new!
<p>

He should try to create his own thought<br>
And not steal someone else's plot<br>
   He's surely no poet<br>
   But he don't even know it.<br>
He pretends to be something he's not.

He lived on the cheese,<br>

<em>Burdew's Screw</em><br>

An old desert rat named Burdew<br>
Came to town one day for a screw.<br>
He threw down a quarter<br>
And drawled out, "That orter<br>
Cover a quick poke or two."
<p>
The madam looked very askance<br>
At the grime on his shirt and his pants,<br>
His scruffy gray beard,<br>
The eyes that went weird,<br>
And the odor that wasn't from France.
<p>
"Ol" fella," she said with a grin,<br>
"For a quarter, I'll let you right in<br>
To a room that's just ripe<br>
For a man of your type<br>
And a gal that's ideal for your sin."
<p>
The prospector's eyes went aglow<br>
As the fire began burning below.<br>
His hands started shaking<br>
And his knees were aquaking.<br>
It was plain he was rarin' to go.
<p>
So they led him out back of the place<br>
To a shed with just enough space<br>
For the fattest pink sow,<br>
He'd seen anyhow<br>
With a sorta' sweet smile on her face.
<p>
Burdew shoved everyone aside,<br>
Slammed the door and was quickly astride<br>
His porky delight<br>
Where he spent the whole night<br>
In a passionate piggyback ride!
<p>
At daybreak, Burdew poked his head<br>
Out of the tumbledown shed<br>
With a satisfied sigh,<br>
He said, "Miss Piggy and I<br>
Will be having our breakfast in bed."

I once had a wife I called Cher<br>
Who's voice was only just fair<br>
And as everyone knows<br>
When it comes to her clothes<br>
She exposes her ass to the air!

Not so, you'll be happy to hear!<br>
Although not a fag<br>
Sex just isn't his bag<br>

So love-starved at Christmas was Bunny,<br>
She hung mistletoe over her cunny<br>
No man ever kissed her<br>
A fact that quite pissed her<br>
And made bunny walk kinda funny!

Though I may be about to retire, <br>
Ladies, come light my Christmas fire!<br>
Though I'll well over fifty<br>
Come get this gifty - <br>
Eight inches of throbbing desire!

She took it home to bed to sleep.<br>
The sheep turned out to be a ram<br>
And Mary had a little lamb.

Evangalist Duffy McGuire<br>
Preached Hell and Brimstone and Fire<br>
And when all the folks went<br>
In the back of the tent<br>
He boffed all the girls in the choir!

A creative fellow named Jewitt<br>
Knew of 2,000 ways to "do it"<br>
But the man was so ugly<br>
No girl would get snuggly<br>
And he never did get around to it.

Goldilocks has lots of guys<br>
Pinnochio's one, I'm advised!<br>
She sits on the puppet<br>
And sticks his nose up it<br>
And makes the poor fellow tell lies!
