So it was unremarkable that Sofie Mae remained completely uninterested in the gentleman who had 
purchased the forty-acre spread at the foot of Widow's Peak from her first (and second) cousin Floyd, 
although the new arrival in town certainly had the town atwitter.  A city feller hailing from the far east 
(Richmond, Virginia, a state capital!), the gentleman in question, who introduced himself as "Bertram 
Lindenwood, but you can call me Bertie", amazed the locals with his odd accent, shirts with no holes and far 
too many buttons, and the little tape recorder he carried everywhere with him.
<p>
"Strange feller, probl'y onodem homaseckshuls" opined Jake, proprietor of  Dusty's Tavern, spitting into the 
peanut shells on the floor.  "He asked me for some weird kinda beer - rock'n'roll or something-like, and axed 
if he could tape me?  He sez he studies dialectical speech or somtin.  I told him to get lost and all we had 
was Budweiser like any man would drink."<p>

Kix Dunkin nodded wisely.  The town's only law enforcement, he wore his name proudly.  "I kicked my 
momma in the womb, and that's why she named me Kix, and I'm gonna kick your butt now!" was his 
favorite (and frequently-recited) speech, aimed at the town's occasional lawbreaker, usually bored kids 
tipping cows.  "Yeah, but he lives right at the foot of Widow's Peak, and look what happened to Sofie Mae's 
lil' sister!  Something about them Strunks likes the weird ones."
