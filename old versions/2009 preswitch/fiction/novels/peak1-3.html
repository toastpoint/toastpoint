At the First Reformed Evangelical Fundamentalist Mission Church, just
across the headwaters of Right Wing Creek, which also ran through the
stranger's property (and - during the spring floods - through the better part
of his humble abode, which was why Floyd had sold out, that and the fact
that the revenuers were getting suspicious about his latest distilling
enterprise), the stranger's appearance did not escape notice either.
Husband and wife evangelical team, Flem and Flammie Flaker discussed the
matter among themselves.
<p>
"Whut iff'n he is probl'y onodem homaseckshuls like ever body claims?" said
Flem. "I reckon the only right thing to do is run him outta town 'less he
reforms and gits saved and shows good faith by makin' a substantial
offerin' to the church."
<p>
"You probl'y right, Honey," said Flammie, who had long since learned that
this was the only acceptable response to anything her husband said to her.
Flammie, who had many years ago given up a lucrative career as a Mary Kay
representative to marry Flem, had been immediately attracted to Bertie. Not
only was he good-looking (he appeared to have all his own teeth and was
clean-shaven), but he was from the big city (a state capital!) and, if the
rumors of his homaseckshulality were true, he might be knowledgeable about
the latest hairstyles and make-up techniques. Ever' body said that's what
them homaseckshuls was interested in-hair and make-up. Plus,he was so
cute - and if the rumors were indeed true - perhaps she could use her Christian
feminine wiles to change his sexual preference, save his soul, and learn
some hair and make-up tips while doin' the Lord's work. Why, she
considered, she might even be the first female saint to be recognized by
the First Reformed Evangelical Fundamentalist  Mission Church, which would
no doubt lead to her gettin' all kinds of offers to be on talk shows where
she could announce her ambitions to be a country-western songwriter (she
was already halfway through her first song, "I Found Salvation on my Knees
at the Lonely Hearts Motel") So absorbed was she in these dreams that she
barely heard Flem's announcement that he "wuz goin' up on Widow's Peak to
see iff'n I kin git that pore chile Sofie Mae to come to church agin."
<p>
Thus, as Flem scaled the peak in the hopes of redeeming Sofie Mae's soul - or
at least getting a glimpse of the resplendent bounty that the Lord had
bestowed upon her, Flammie finished applying her third coat of mascara to
her carefully curled lashes and coated her full sensuous lips with gloss in
anticipation of the missionary position which she was about to assume.

As she lay entwined with Elmer Maypole on the floor of the back of her
father's squad car, Trixi Dunkin thought she felt the earth move, but after
a moment's consideration, decided it was just the squad car careening
around the hairpin turn half-way up the twisted and torturous backroad that
lead to the precipitous pinnacle of Widow's Peak. So intent were Trixi and
Elmer's attention's on each other, neither had heard her father get into
his car, slam the door, gun the engine, and race away as he was wont to do
every time someone called in a suspected cow-tipping. But Trixi and Elmer
were only fifteen, so they could be forgiven a momentary lapse of
attentiveness so common among young people their age, especially
since-given the shallowness and stagnation of the gene pool among the
residents of Widow's Peak (and even nearby out-lying areas)- such attention
deficits were often a genetic certainty.
<p>
While she and Elmer (unnoticed by her father) struggled quietly back into
their clothes, Trixi couldn't help but feel blessed at her singular good
luck in snaring Elmer as her steady boyfriend. Not only was he-the richest
boy she knew!- merely distantly related to her, but he was also the
quarterback and defensive lineman on the Widow's Peak High School "Fighting
Arachnids" football team-noted for being the smallest team in the state.
With only six team members, each boy had to play two-and sometimes three,
if anyone got so severely injured as to not be able to finish the game-
positions. While this contributed to Elmer's physical agility that carried
over into other aspects of his life, it often left him so exhausted that he
was unable to give Trixi the attention she felt she deserved. Lucky for
her, last night's game had been forfeited by the Skunk Creek "Stinkers,"
who were unable to play because they had some kind of communicable disease,
so the "Fighting Arachnids" devoted their attentions to celebrating their
first victory in a way that was pretty much guaranteed to increase the
population of Widow's Peak in approximately nine months.
<p>
Her reverie was cut short as her father, Kix Dunkin, suddenly slammed on
the brakes at the entrance to Elmer's mother's prestigious doublewide that
was placed precipitously upon a precipice part-way up the peak, the better
for the residents of the lower part of the peak to admire Marvella
Maypole's conspicuous wealth that she'd suddenly accumulated as a result of
a shrewd life insurance investment on her possibly-late husband, Maynard,
who'd vanished without a trace in the mysterious coal mine cave-in deep
within the hidden recesses of Widow's Peak two years earlier. While Trixi
wondered why her father had continued to twice-weekly (usually on a
Wednesday and Saturday) investigate Maynard's disappearance, who was she to
question his integrity?  After all, didn't he have a certificate from a
correspondence school in police science prominently displayed in the dining
room? So what if he hadn't gotten around to investigating all the other
disappearances yet? It wasn't like anyone had actually filed missing person
complaints or anything. And wasn't he still broken-hearted from when
Trixi's mother left him two years ago to run off to Wheeling and find
herself by becoming a dental hygienist?
