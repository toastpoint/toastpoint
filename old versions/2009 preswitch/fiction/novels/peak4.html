As Flo served Trixie her second order of fried pork rinds, she thought to herself that she'd have to get after Eb again about installing a crematorium just like she'd read the big city funeral parlors had. Perhaps, she mused, with a few minor adjustments, a crematorium could also be used as a pizza oven and tanning bed. That'd certainly increase their earnings, and goodness knew, if the local people didn't either die or eat out more, they'd be 
in the red again this month.  Of course, Slam's funeral would help, but they'd have to lay out a lot to fix him up suitable for an open-casket viewing if Kix decided he wanted one - and there would go the profits - plus odds were good that, given the nature of Slam's death, Kix wouldn't want a catered pork barbecue, which was one of Flo's most cost-effective funeral repasts.
<p>
Flo's reveries were interrupted when Kix himself walked in.  "Speak of the devil," she said aloud, not realizing that she hadn't been speaking of him, only thinking of him, but then no one said "Think of the devil," for it purely wouldn't make sense.
<p>
"Now, Flo," said Kix, "we don't for sure know Slam is goin' to hell, even though the evidence seems to indicate it."
<p>
"Whutcha mean, Pa?" spoke up Trixie, who stopped shovelling fried pork rinds into her mouth long enough to notice her father had come in.
<p>
"Well, Trix," said Kix, "I don't know how to break this to you gently so I'll jes' flat out say it - yore Uncle Slam done got hisself killed and - as next of kin - we gotta plan the 
funeral."
<p>
"Le's have it on a weekday so I kin miss school," Trixie volunteered.
"Iff'n we had it Friday mornin',I'd have time to get my hair done Friday afternoon for the Prom on Saturday."
<p>
Flo pulled out her well-thumbed appointment book. "Nope," she said, "Friday ain't no good. I 
gotta cook all day for to cater the Prom. Friday and Saturday both is out.  Sunday, I'll be plumb too tired. How about sometime next week?"
<p>
"Naw," said Kix, "spring gobbler season starts then. "I guess we'll have to hold off for a while.  You got enough space in your freezer to keep ol' Slam a mite longer."
<p>
"Anythang for you, Kix, honey," said Flo, who had secretly harbored a crush for him all these years. She was a sucker for his uniform, that was a fact.
<p>

As Kix pondered funeral arrangements for his deceased brother, as Trixie
polished off the remainder of her pork rinds, and as Flo dreamed about a
combination crematorium/pizza oven/tanning booth, a strange procession
of pick-up trucks was slowly winding its weary way along the twisting
turns of a winding road on the far side of the peak in the dirction of
the Old Cardwell Mansion, abandoned for since the Civil War, when one of
the Cardwell ancestors-upset that West Virginia had seceded from
Virginia which had seceded from the Union-seceded his large and tangled
family from West Virginia and reportedly left for Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, to wait out the conclusion of the War.
<p>        Just as Kix was about to make his menu decision for his
brother's
funeral, a call came over the radio that a massive traffic jam had
ensued when a rocking chair containing an old woman had slid from the
bed of a pick-up onto the center line of the Widow's Peak Turnpike.
Traffic, wandering livestock, and a tour bus bound for the state capital
were entangled in hopeless gridlock.  Kix ran for the squad car and left
town with his tires squealing and his siren blaring. He was closely
followed by over half the townspeople who, like Kix, had never seen a
traffic jam close up and wanted in on the thrill of it. Besides, they
figured, Kix couldn't arrest them for speeding if he was in front.<p>

     As Kix approached the center of town, he began to wonder if
the strain of recent events was starting to make him lose his
wits. Sitting in the middle of the street was an empty rocking
chair. A well coifed middle aged woman was running about
screaming and frantically dialing a portable phone. A deranged
looking girl of who knows what age was hanging over the side of
one truck alternately grinning and making a terrible
"Aweehhheenck" noise.
<p>
     "Pawline, Pawleeeene", screamed the woman, "what has happened to
Grandmother? I just can't fathom how her chair slid out of that
truck! I saw Ergu tighten the ropes holdin it this morning when
we left Kentucky, and the only other person in the truck was
'cestula, and she's not bright enough to know how to cut them
ropes. Ain't that right 'cestula?"
<p>
     "Aweehhheenck", "Aweehhheenck" said the imbecilic girl. Kix
swore he saw her drop something shiny down between the bed of the
truck and the cab but he just couldn't quite be sure.
<p>
     "Somebody must a put her up to it or just made it look like
she did it. If we don't find out who, we're just gonna have to
punish the entire family".
<p>
     All of these words were screamed into the portable phone,
although the conversation was obviously taking place with a black
haired lady who barely stifling a malevolent grin, said "That
would take all night Auntie. Besides the first thing we gotta do
is find Grandmother, before she does God knows what to one of the
local boys. You know how much trouble she caused us back in Baton
Rouge".
<p>
     The middle aged woman who was now beginning to regain her
composure, patted her coifed curls gently and said. "I'm sure I
haven't the foggiest idea what you could be refferrin to Pauline,
but you are right we must find dear ol' Granny"
<p>
     Kix' brain was still workin hard trying to take all this in,
when his body gave a start, and he let out with a blood curdling
yelp. He swung round to see the grinning face of a toothless
white haired old woman, who as best he could figure out had just
goosed him with her cane.
<p>
     "Cute little fanny ya got there Sonny", said the old hag now
positively leering at Kix. "bet I could show ya some things ya
didn't even know people could do".
<p>
     Kix' brain had never been adept at changing gears either
quickly or smoothly. Now it was positively stuck in neutral.
Finally his vocal chords decided to act on their own. "What the
Hell" they exclaimed loudly, trying their best to give his brain
time to get unstuck.
<p>
     "Granny, come over here now" the black haired lady said
sternly. "you know people don't always appreciate your
attentions".
<p>
     "But he has such a" said the hag.
<p>
     "Granny! , Ergu!" said Pauline.
<p>
     Suddenly a large Arabic sort of male like (but not quite)
person had appeared, and uttering a couple of grunts, picked up
the Granny, set her back in the chair, then picked up said chair,
and put it back in the truck, retied it, and got back behind the
wheel of the lead truck.
<p>
     Kix felt some stirring in his brain, although what he was
mainly feeling was a pain in his ass. Just as his brain began to
overcome this he suddenly realized that the middle aged woman was
speaking to him.
<p>
     "Why sir thank you so much for finding Granny, she does ah
wander so". Proffering a perfumed hand she said "Crystabel
Cardwell hee-uh. Now if you don't mind we've had such a long
journey, with such an unsettlin finish, I think we'll just be
getting down to the Cardwell property, but do come to tea after
we get settled".
<p>
     With that Crystabel began to walk back to the lead truck.
<p>
     Kix' brain suddenly recovered. "Hey, wait a minute, you
can't go yet, that there woman just assaulted me" (the literal
nature of his choice in words escaped Kix).
<p>
     Crystabel turned, patted her curls and said "Ah haven't the
foggiest idea what your talkin about. Why shame on you for saying
such a thing about a poor ol' Granny". Ah am not sure-uh that you
can come to tea after all.
<p>
     "Whatya mean", Kix said, That woman assaulted me and I have
the evidence right here behind ...".
<p>
     Suddenly Kix thought better of it. What sort of humiliation
might he have to endure from his buddies? Suppose the case went
to trial. Suppose he was asked to present his evidence. He had
also heard in cases like this that medical evidence might be
needed, and what gettin that might entail made him shudder.
Besides he needed to get back to burying Slam.
<p>
     "Well okay, I guess the poor ol' dear didn't mean no harm.
How the hell old is she anyway?"
<p>
     Crystabel froze, shuddered, patted her curls, and said. "I
can see we didn't return one moment too soon! This town has lost
its civility since our family left before the whar-uh. WE are a
genteel old southern family, and no one of us would ever publicly
refer to something as sensitive to a mature lady's age. You SURH
may definitely NOT come to tea until you learn some manners! 
<p>     With that she jumped back into the lead truck, and the
profession moved on down the hill to the old Cardwell  mansion,
leaving the townsfolk with their mouths open. Poor Kix had never
had such a day as this so he just stood there for forty minutes
alternately rubbing his forehead and his behind, wondering how he
was gonna tactfully ask Flo for the right kind of ointment.
<p>
     Just before Kix recovered his wits enough to get on with
things, he noticed an old 1950's Ford convertible putting up the
pike toward town. He thought about wondering who that was, but
his battered brain said no, and he carefully got back into his
car.
<p>

Meanwhile, as Kix contemplated the contents of the convertible, as Flo
cleaned up at the diner, as Eb stuffed Slam’s body into the freezer, as
Trixie left the diner and window-shopped at the Widow’s Peak Emporium
for a suitable black strapless chiffon prom dress, and as Flem and
Flammie applied a lubricating lotion to their inflamed wrists following
the hand-cuff removal, Sofie Mae Strunk and Bertie Lindamood wended
their way through the wild and winding pathway with a somewhat
recalcitrant Petunia, who really did not want to have to return to her
hog-pen and miss all the fun.
<p>
Upon arriving at her humble hovel, Sofie snapped on her CB radio in
hopes of finding suitable transmissions to set the mood for what she was
increasingly hopeful might be an amorous encounter with the cultured
stranger. Sometimes, the citizenry of Widow’s Peak—not wanting to miss
any breaking news—left not only their CB’s on, but also an adjacent
radio. Occasionally, if one got lucky, one might hear some real romantic
stuff like Mantovanni or Tony Bennett. As Sofie scanned the dial, she
heard no such romantic background music, but only a strange screech
coming from what must be Kix Dunkin’s police radio, and she nearly
turned off her CB to escape the offensive and decidely non-romantic
cacaphony.
<p>
“Wait!" yelled Bertie, ever the linguistic scholar. “I’ve heard that
sound before!" He quickly consulted his notebook that he always carried
in his left brest pocket and thumbed through it—the notebook, not the
pocket. “Yes! Here it is! That particular sound has only been documented
in a remote Louisiana parish. And to think, I’ve heard it here! I must
go to the source of that sound! Sofie, can you help me find it?"
<p>
While it wasn’t the kind of date Sofie had envisioned (for she was
hoping to have the Blue Plate Special at Flo’s Diner before getting down
to the serious business of the courtship process), but it was better
than nothing, so she agreed. After making sure Petunia’s pen was
double-locked, and with her portable CB in hand, she led Bertie back
down the wild and wending—or was it winding? Well, whatever— path,
taking a couple of short-cuts through the brush to get to the highway
whenever the CB signal seemed to get stronger. Finally, with leaves and
twigs clinging to them, they crawled down an embankment and arrived in
the midst of what was the largest gathering of folks and the first
traffic jam Sofie Mae had ever seen.
<p>
"Lawsy, me!" she exclaimed. "I ain’t never seen this many folks since
the revenooers raided my daddy’s still back when I was knee-high to a
banty rooster.!"
