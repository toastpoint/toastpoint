<h3><a href=mailto:unapoemer@aol.com>Unapoemer</a> begins a Mystery novel 11/26/98</h3>
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.<p>
  Her shoes and purse were both made of alligator skin, I noticed immediately. Was she looking for the parents of this baby
alligator? Maybe she was wearing the evidence, My mind was racing, and I was ready to solve the case. She asked for a light
for the extra long cigarette she pulled from her purse, and began to speak. I was daydreaming and didn't here a word she said.

<h3><a href=mailto:jordan@email.uc.edu>Quinton "E" Jordan</a> begins a novel 11/24/98</h3>
He was so alone that the desperation for a friend almost took his breath.  
The world laughed aloud while he was so afraid to give in.
He was afraid that life itself had cursed him.

<h3><a href=mailto:lkd@skycorp.com>Laura Dadd</a> begins a Fantasy novel 11/19/98</h3>
     In the chill dawn a lone rider floated in the mists of the foot hills. Its eyes swept the countryside that was visible from the lofty
perch.  Behind its dark helmet a soft yet determined female voice chanted "They will not know who avenges; but they will pay for
the death dealt to the Noiku clan."<p>
Pulling sharply on the reigns of the giant black steed, it turned with a violent head toss.  Galloping quickly away.  Master and mount
anxiously sped toward the choppy ocean and the bobbing ship waiting to wisk them to the north.  There, in the frontier marchlands,
agonizing trainning and cunning subterfuge would come together to wipe the Mikokiku from the earth and the afterworld.
Climbing aboard, she looked at no one except the man who took her demon dark horse. The keen aura of hatred burning around
her assured her a safe passage about the rig.<p>
 The passengers were seedy at best.  Averting their eyes whenever she passed one.  It smelled of unwashed men, vomit, and
animals.  The nauseating smell and the cut-throats surrounding her, never fazed the girl.  Only the grim future flashing befor her
eyes occupied her thoughts and senses.

<I>The author comments,</I> "Forgive the made up Japanese.  Hopefully you folks find this entertaining."

Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?<p>
  Her life could not get much worse. But suddenly along came Lachlan. The cutest guy in the 
entire school. Beverly quickly ran
behind a bush. How could she let Lachlan know she had been kicked off the chearleading squad?  
It was about the only thing she
had to impress boys. Especially boys like Lachlan. As he passed, Beverly slowly crawled out of the bush and went home.

  "Well, Walt...What do you have to say for yourself?"  Her southern draw did not sing with a southern sweetness like usual.
She continued slowly, "Can you honestly look me in the eye and tell me you had no idea that Oscar was pregnant?  Can you sit
there with your belly fallin' out of your pants and cigarette ash about to drop in that stale coffee of yours and tell me that you
didn't know that Oscar was even a damn female, Walter?!  Well look at who arrived this mornin' at the gator farm."
She spoke slowly and carefully and Water knew that he was in trouble.  He ashed his Marlboro and looked at the baby
alligator writhing around on his desk and then his eyes fell back onto Gia's ice cold stare.  <p>
"Gia, I don't know what to tell you, sweetheart.  I know that we weren't expecting another gator for a while and that gator
meats not sellin', baby, but I couldn't resist another one."  <p>
She responded quickly. "I know you love them gators, Walt, but how could you lie to me and tell me Oscar was a male when
he should be named Oscarita!  Dammit Walter, we cannot afford another gator right now and this is your problem!"  Gia left
the baby gator and stomped out of the smokey office.  Walter slowly picked up the phone and spoke. "Hello, Dr. Turner?
Yeah, this is Walter Jackson down in Miami.  Fine sir, how are you?  Listen, I just got that shipment in from Cuba that you've
been waiting for.  Yes sir, you have a new born, highly rare species of baby alligator waiting for you.  Yes sir, it's nice doin'
business with you and you can make that check out to Walter B. Jackson."

<h3><a href=mailto:Jez313@aol.com>Emily </a> begins a Fantasy novel 11/11/98</h3>
"But really, Bartholomew" laughed Lady Zinnia with her characteristic 
throaty chuckle, "You can't be serious!  Lady Thanninger, with that 
dashing young... oh, no, it can't be.  He's simply too <em>common</em> 
for someone of her station!"<p>
     "Yes, M'Lady. Tis true," Bartholomew said. "Lady Thanninger has ordered them to be married by sundown on Sunday."<p>
"It's amazing... Anderford!" Zinnia called. <p>"Yes m'am?" her servant replied nervously. <p>"Get my horse ready. I have a visit to
make to my dear neighbor." She smiled wickedly. "Come Bartholomew."   <p>    Lady Thanninger of the village, Chesterfield, sat
quietly in her quarters. "Of all things," the old woman contemplated, "Why this? I have been enemies with Lord Wextershire for
years. But now, he has taken my country hostage with... Oh! I cannot bear to think it. I'll lose my country either path I take."
Thanninger had been in an emotional frenzy ever since Lord Wextershire, the second most evil human being on the face of the
Earth(Lady Zinnia was the first.) held her country at ransom. The only way she could prevent it from being destroyed was to
marry his son, Aran. One way or another her country would be taken over by Wextershire. "That slimy, no good..." <p>
A knock sounded on her door. "Who would be coming this late? The moon has been out for hours... Who is there?" she called.<p>
"Thanninger? This is Zinnia! Open up, dear, we have a wedding to plan!"
<p>
<I>The author comments,</I> "Hi! I am 14 years old and was browsing the web when i found this contest. I'm a frequent

Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?  <p>
  "Why don't I just tell her the truth?", she wondered.  Beverly always did things to please her mom.  What she really longed to
do was join the Math Club.  Algebra excited her; Solving for x was her passion.  And then there was Clarence... that lanky
red-head who glanced shyly at Beverly whenever he thought she wasn't looking.  Well now she would do something to please
herself.  As she skipped home to confront her mother, she sang a new cheer,"X=y+z, makes a winner outta BEVERLY-Go
ME!!!"

<h3><a href=mailto:iadato@sciti.com>Daphne </a> begins a Fantasy novel 11/04/98</h3>
Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.  <p>
Teeth chattering, the clerk had the nerve to try again.  "Sirrrr?" He quivered, desperately trying to hide his knocking knees. "I
have only one question....please."<p>
The king fixed him with the evil eye and spoke furiosly through loudly gnashing teeth.  "Bring me my wand!"  He screamed,
using his gigantic body to create a wind that nearly knocked over the poor creature huddling at his feet.  
<p>
The wand was brought
in, an impressive thing of at least three feet, crafted of magic iron and embedded with gorgeous jewels.  The king pointed his
wand at the brave clerk and muttered, sending a shaft of lightning directly toward him.  The  clerk was immediately changed
into a basilisk, the tiny dragon-like creature that has the capabilty of killing anyone that its eyes turn upon.  "AAAgh!"  The king
cried.  "He was supposed to become a cow--"  
<p>
But at just that moment, the clerk/basilisk turned his gaze upon the throne, and
within a blink of an eye, the Terrible King of Zendor was no more.  The basilisk calmly strolled out of the castle, satisfied with
his new-found powers.
