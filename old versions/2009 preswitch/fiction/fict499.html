<h3>Elise Fayre begins a Coming of Age novel 04/28/99</h3>
I stood silently, hearing the sound of the water flowing in the fountain and the
whisper of my heart. I gazed intently into the green depths of a gentle soul and for that
moment I felt fearless.I watched, mesmerized, as his lips moved and at the precise
moment my brain registered the words he spoke, I disregarded them.
They slid off my back like the cool water streamed off the sharp rocks; smooth and
definitive.<p>
I looked on, believing strongly, intuitively, that I was right and that everything else
would be made right as long as I continued to believe. 
His words, which had so carefully been aimed at my resolve, fell unheeded and I stood
gracefully, unpierced by his denial. His eyes told the truth.
My determination carrying me, my faith flowing through me, I was not surprised that he
admitted what had already been made aware to me. The man before me, who radiated
warmth and sincerity,
told me, while I swallowed my own pride, that he doubted his heart at times. He
confessed that he had loved before, yet questioned the purity of his emotions.  
Not in so many words, he had supported my insight with his disclosure. I imagine that a
certain amount of detachment was necessary in order for him to maintain his own
resolve.His decision not to fall in love so easily. <p>
I understand the need to protect one's self from falling too hard, but failing to jump, or
even to step at all, can be an oversight. In any case, with great creedence I embraced
the infinate nature of man.<p>
He told me to hold out my hand and when I did he placed a shiny quarter in my palm.
Its metallic sheen sparkled as it caught and cast the sun's glow over the surface of the
waiting water. My wish was immersed and held,
treasured by the inviting fountain as my friend,open to the possibility of being
honest,was cherished by my heart and my soul. When the time came for us to part, I
hugged him. I smiled,imagining he could hear me say "I love you.".

<h3>P.B. Gordon begins a Romance novel 04/16/99</h3>
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...<p>
  It has just been an innocent trip into the island's port city to do some souvenir shopping. Not for herself of course, she
worked on the boat, but for her niece Cheryl, who was seriously ill and would probably never travel again. As she walked
down the dirt path to the little booth where she knew she would get a fair price, Monique was stopped by the usual assortment
of island children, puting their small brown hands into her pockets and asking for change or candy. They found the coins she
had left in her pockets for that purpose and she smiled as she handed out the little pieces of chocolate she had armed herself
with. When her pockets were empty, and the chocolates gone, they left. Monique looked around her and realized that the
children had taken her off course. She didn't recognize a single landmark. And the men standing in the doorway across the way
didn't look too friendly. She felt someone touch her elbow and whirled around, ready to defend herself and found herself !
looking into deep blue eyes of friendship. Or at least, she hoped they were.

emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne,

moments for the man to regain his courage and with a trembling voice manneged to say:

<h3>Anonymous begins a  novel 04/08/99</h3>
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...<p>
  She was a small and scared girl back then, no more then seventeen years of age.  She never really wanted to come to
Greece, but then again no one had asked of her opinion. No one ever did.   
It wasn't by choice that she was now the servant and even lover of the glorious Sir Jon Underhand of Kingsbridge. She had
been given to him a few years earlier by her treacherouse parents.  They had never cared for Monique, she had been a
burdonsome accident.  It was probably the best stroke of luck for them when they found that Sir Jon had taken favor of her.
Monique had been to poor to marry him but he was much to eager to arrange for her to live in his castle and become his pet.
So it were her nightly connections with the Earl of Kingsbridge that bought her the the ticket on the Pacific Princess.

<h3><a href=mailto:Condor216@hotmail.com>Michael Hammond</a> begins a War
novel 04/05/99</h3>
They stood on the top of the hill near camp overlooking the destruction below.  The
night was dark and cold, gunfire and grenade blasts rang loudly in the air.  Explosions lit
up the night sky.  Phillipe stood turned and began to walk back to camp, they needed a
new front line for they already lost most of the men stationed there.  A large war has
broken out not yet considered a world war but soon when the Americans and their
allies get involved it would be.  For now all Phillipe cared about was his battle against
Italy.  France was thought to be a good match against Italy but they were wrong,
casualties were higher for France and their weapon supply was drastically low.  Phillipe
didn't know who fired first all he knew was that France and Italy were both bombed
and both Countries denied firing.
<p>  Phillipe walked into the main tent and saw many men
around a model of the battlefield.  "Ah, General Sucre, glad you could join us" said
Colonel Migre. <p> "This is no time for welcomes" said Phillipe, "the fact of the matter is we are losing down there and when not if gentlemen
they get through us there will be no one to stop them from invading the Capitol.  Now
we need to us what little men and resources we have left to hold them off until we can
communicate with the main forces." <p> "Well Phillipe that would be easier said then done,
you see our communications are completely down on both sides of the battle." said a
man standing in the back of the room. <p>  "And who might I ask are you?" Phillipe asked. <p>
"Well sir, I'm the communications technician." The man said with a little bit of pride in
his voice. <p>"Then there is only one thing left to do," Phillipe said, "I will take some men
and we will ride into the city while you hold the Italians off." <p>     "Phillipe that would
work but as you know we don't have one man to spare." said Colonel Migre. <p>"Then,"
Phillipe said, "I must go alone." <p>Suddenly there was an uproar of voices, everyone
speaking their disapproval of one of their best defense coordinators being absent when they were at their
worst. <p> Colonel Migre spoke up, "Phillipe, I trust you with my life and if you believe
this is the only way then this is the only way." <p> During the next hour Phillipe's jeep was
loaded with everything that could possibly be needed in any condition.  Phillipe got into
the jeep and started it up.  He turned and looked at the distressed looks everyone had
and he suddenly felt a spark of doubt but quickly buried it down inside him.  He put the
car in gear and pushed the gas.  It should only take him 2 hours to get into civilization
again. <p> As he drove off the fear of doubt that he wouldn't make it came back but this
time he couldn't lose it.  The first hour was uneventful as expected, then Phillipe heard
something to his left.  He glanced over and saw a man carrying a gun and wearing an
Italian uniform.  They had already crossed the line.  Phillipe's worst fear suddenly came
true.  It wasn't long before he was noticed.  The man aimed his gun and began to fire.  Phillipe unholstered
his pistol and one hand on the wheel and the other holding the gun he began to fire.  His
first two shots missed but the third hit.  The man fell to the ground with a gunshot to the
head.  Phillipe did not have a silencer and neither did the other man, more men began to
come.  Phillipe fired of some more shots but was not as lucky, they all missed. <p> Phillipe
popped the clutch into gear and pushed the gas to floor.  He was about 15 miles out
from the city.  He would make it before the men and would warn them.  More bullets
were fired so Phillipe ducked down.  The men were almost out of sight and Phillipe
Would soon be in the city.  A shot was fired and it hit Phillipe in the back, then a
second shot was heard and Phillipe was hit in the back of the neck.  The car swerved
to the side of the road and it was hard for Phillipe to breath.  He knew he was close
enough to the city to use the radio but when he tried he couldn't speak.  The pain was excruciating he would have to send
the message in Morse code.  He tapped in simply "enemy coming fast."  He heard the
enemy men coming toward to finish him off.  Phillipe wondered              
how he could slow them down, then he knew.  He reached for his vest and pulled off a
grenade, he pulled the pen and when the men were at his jeep he released it.  A giant
explosion went off and all the men were killed including Phillipe. <p>  The war was later
resolved before the U.S. ever entered.  This will be known as the Eastern War in
history books and Phillipe's name will be mentioned.  He was known as the Paul Revere
of the 20th century.  This was not the last war or the first, but it was a war that brought
peace between two Nations.
