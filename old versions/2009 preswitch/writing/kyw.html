<h3>The horror, the horror, the horror - mornings of KYW</h3>
<p>
<h5><strong>Welcomat</strong> - September 1993</h5>
<p>"*Beep* *Beep* *Beep* - goodness of garlic without the offensive
odor!"   Freaked by the alarm and the radio going off
simultaneously, the cat jumps off the bed as my arm gropes the
nightstand trying to find the switch to turn off the beeps while
leaving the radio on.  The day begins with a half-hour spent
drifting in and out of sleep while absorbing KYW News Radio's
broadcasts by osmosis.  I used to listen to WFLN, but Sousalarm
notwithstanding, my awake periods would never coincide with the
weather.  No such problem with KYW, which a co-worker of mine
refers to as "All weather...all the time".  It's not, of course. 
It's "all garlic tablet commercials...all the time".  Half-awake,
I wonder for the thousandth time why the garlic tablet people
never exactly specify what the "goodness of garlic" is, and why
these trashy women are talking about their "repeating" and
"offensive odor" problems while I'm trying to sleep.  Who takes
these things anyway?  And does the husband of the woman who
excitedly claims she can "get extra-close to her co-workers" know
about this?
<p>KYW doesn't have to resort to Sousa marches - it is perfectly
capable of annoying someone out of bed.  It's almost scary to
have a bit on a presidential speech followed by Tom Bodett of
Motel 6 ("We'll leave the light on for ya").  Tom actually makes
me smile, but Melrose Diner and Marv Polo's Chevrolet commercials
make me cringe.  Marv takes the prize for the most thought-
provoking annoying commercial because he promotes interesting
lines of inquiry.  Tell us what you MEAN by "the world's smallest
Chevrolet dealer", Marv!  Does your lot only having two cars on
it?  Do you only sell tiny little Chevrolets?  Are you short?  Is
just part of your anatomy short?
<p>And while "Hooked on Phonics" and the "S-O-C-K-S" people are
fighting it out to for the business of teaching stupid people in
fun ways, the Spanish language people need to talk to the Phonics
people about their grammar.  For instance, their mnemonic for
"What time is it?" or "Que hora es?" is "K or a S" .  This may
tell you how to ask the time in Spanish, but it's bad English. 
Maybe you can only add a second language by losing some of the
first.
<p>Listening to morning news while half-asleep does add some
interesting twists to world events, since your fuzzy mind will
grab onto ideas in strange ways.  The midwest flooding situation
causes the announcer to discuss the 15-foot dikes in Iowa and I
imagine huge, corn-fed lesbians.  The cat pokes me awake again
just the sports announcer informs the audience that in last
night's basketball game, the Tigers forced the Owls to make
twenty-two turnovers.  Hmmm... jungle cats with guns holding
birds hostage in a kitchen - "All right, we want twelve apple and
ten cherry - bake, you feathered bastards!".  An ad for a
restaurant 
stresses "constantly changing menus" and, drifting off
again, I dream of a fat matron screaming and dropping her menu as
it mutates before her eyes.  
<p>But at last Fred Sherman's irreverent surreal financial advice,
and the cat jumping up and down on my bladder, gets me out of bed
and into the bathroom.  I put on a tape of some twenty-year old
rock, climb into the shower and forget about the goodness of
garlic until tomorrow.
