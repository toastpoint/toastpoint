<H2>THE JOYS OF BEING SMUG ABOUT ENGLISH USAGE</H2>
<p>
<h5><strong>Welcomat</strong> - November 1, 1989</h5>
<p>     I am one of those people who are so confident of their
knowledge of the niceties of the English language that they find
a good deal of entertainment in the occasional odd usage, a good
pun or a classic misinterpretation.  If I can manage to insert
into the sentence the phrase "gave me pause", it's usually
followed with "big, hairy ones."  If someone tells me to depress
the clutch, I tell the clutch about the homeless situation, or
that its mother died.  Then there's the Chinese lunch cart at
16th and Market whose sign at the pick-up window advises, "Order
other window please".  Does anyone else feel the urge and say
"I'll have the other window please"?
<p>     My mom is a self-appointed English usage cop and she raised
me to yell at people who mispronounce etcetera (there's no "eck"
in there) or nuclear.  However, this is the woman who also once
mentioned "Every time Karl Malden is on TV saying 'it's dangerous
to carry cash', I think 'What's dangerous to Carrie Cash, and
who's Carrie Cash, anyway?'".
<p>     The business office is a good place for creating new works
-
such as "downsizing" - and for using input as a verb (it's not). 
Here in the government, we have one of my favorites - excess as a
verb.  This is not the classing English grammar problem of the
difference between "access" and "excess" - this is really using
sentences like "We're going to excess that printer - we don't
need it any more".
<p>     Mom has also put me on the "stamp out hopefully" bandwagon,
but I've just about given up.  If you look up "hopefully" in your
Webster's, you will see that "Hopefully, I'll get a raise" does
not mean the same thing as "I hope I'll get a raise".  But that's
the way people use it nowadays, and it's now common usage, and
the dictionaries should legitimize it any day now.
<p>     A recent move to South Philly has given me a new route to
walk to work - straight up Eight Street.  I've been noticing Dave
Barry's rules for handwritten signs are closely followed in South
Philly:  Every word that ends in "s" gets an apostrophe before
the last letter, and at least one random word must be in
quotation marks, giving us signs like TRY "OUR" CHEESE STEAK'S. 
Every morning when I pass PARKWAY JEWELRY BY "PHYLLIS KELLY", I
wonder what Phyllis's real name is, and why she has to use an
alias.  
<p>     But the brain really starts working when I pass CORONA DI
SETA, "HAIR DESIGN", "STYLING" BY "FRANK".  Okay - Corona Di Seta
is the name of the shop, but what do they do there?  Something
with hair, but "hair design" doesn't mean anything, even without
the quotes.  So we can guess probably cutting or styling.
<p>     No, it can't be styling, because "styling" is in quotes,
too - which means it's not really, or not quite styling.  The
imagination runs wild.  Maybe it's something horrible, like hair
mangling or hair shellacking.  Why else would "Frank" need a
psuedonym?  "Phyllis Kelly" probably just doesn't like her given
name, which might be something like Hortense Schtukgartner, but
"Frank" probably can't afford to let his real name get out.  I
have yet to see what "hair design" comes out of there - if a
customer complains after a haircut, does "Frank" gleefuly cackle,
"Ha, ha - you should have paid attention to the quotes!"?  At
lease none of the words in the sign end in "s".
<p>     All right, so people don't appreciate being told that their
apostrophes are misplaced, that they're being overrun with
quotation marks, or that they're mispronouncing "asterisk" (risk,
not rick).  And I've lost all my friends because I deliberately
misinterpret everything they say.  But it's worth it to be smug
about English language usage.  Notice the usage of "it's" in the
previous sentence - the contraction get's the apostrophe, the
possessive doe's not...
