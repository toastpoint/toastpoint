<h3>Special Bonus Feature!</h3>
<h2>Back Jacket Blurb of the Month</h2>
</center>
This is from John D. MacDonald's <I>A Purple Place for Dying</I>, which is a novel in his wonderful Travis McGee series (no bad fiction, this), published in 1964.  But this blurb has to be read to be believed:
<p>
<I>McGee did not like Mona Fox Yeoman.  She seemed artificial, self-important.  She was provocative rather than seductive, a dare more than a desire.  She made a man want to shake her up, to mat that twenty-five dollar hairdo and knock that lady-of-the-manor style of hers on its can.
<p>
But nobody ever would  Because in one minute she was a big creamy bitch standing right next to McGee - and suddenly she was fallen cooling flesh skittering into the dust with a hole as big as your fist through her wishbone.
<p>
For McGee, that should have been it.  The client was dead.  No fee.  No tears.  Forget it, boy.  Pick up and pack out.
<p>
Yeah.  Sure.  You better believe it.
<p>
Not McGee.</I>
<p>
Big creamy bitch, indeed.

<h3> Paisley Harristweed begins a <em>Tippi Waynewright, Valley Girl Detective</em> novel 10/31</h3>

<h4>The Case of the Missing Earring</h4>
<h5>Chapter 1</h5>
Tippi arose early, shortly after noon. Careful not to wake her
still-sleeping parents, she checked her electronic organizer. Hmmm. Not
much to do today-a tanning session at two, a nail appointment at three. She
really should go to school one of these days, she thought idly, to see if
any cute guys had transferred in since the last time she attended, but
school was such a bore and she'd never get ready in time to make last
period today. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week. Whatever. Applying a streak
of lavender-glittered gel to one of her spiky bleached locks, she wondered
if the girl she paid to attend in her place was keeping her grades up. Not
that it really mattered. The gel applied to her satisfaction, she accessed
her voice mail with a carefully-manicured hand, and heard the frantic voice
of her best friend, Tiffi.<p>
        "Oh, like wow, Tippi!" the disembodied voice shrieked. "I've like
totally misplaced one of my earrings. Did I maybe leave it in your Vette or
what? Like I'm so totally freaked without it, my head looks so geeky with
only three earrings on the left. Can you like go look or what? Call me!" <p>
        Give me a break, thought Tippi, as she turned her attention to her
computer and logged on to check her email. There were the typical messages
from guys wanting to hook up with her, a few blatant ads for various
grooming products, and a slew of messages from Tiffi bewailing her lost
earring. <p>
        Oh well, thought Tippi, I might as well see what I can do. I've,
like, got some time before my tanning appointment and I really don't feel
like working out today. She fumbled under her tousled bed-clothes and
pulled out her cellular phone. Careful not to break her already fragile
three-inch nail, she speed-dialed Tiffi.

<h3>Jack the Dawg begins a <I>Spot Phydeaux, Canine Sleuth</I> novel 10/27</h3>
Spot could smell trouble brewing. His colleague, McGruff the Crime Dog,
whose trenchcoat had mysteriously disappeared, had come howling to him for
help. Without his characteristic trenchcoat, McGruff was just another mutt
in the crowd.
<p>        "Yeah," growled Spot. "Come to me when you've got troubles. And you
call yourself a police dog!"
      <p>  "It ain't funny," snarled McGruff. "I'm the laughing stock of the
precinct. There's talk of putting me back on a beat. The sergeant even
joked about getting me - Gasp! - neutered."
<p>        "Humans have no sense of humor," Spot sympathized, and shook
himself. "I'll see if I can shed some light on the case. Have you sniffed
out any clues?" <p>
        "None," whined McGruff. "I can't even scratch up a suspect." <p>
        "Hmmm, too bad," said Spot, licking himself. "Tailing a suspect is
one of my specialties." <p>
        That was true. Spot Phydeaux, Canine Sleuth, was known far and wide
for his dogged determination. Even if doubt gnawed at him the way he might
gnaw a lambchop, but he'd never admit it to man or beast. <p>
        After McGruff slinked out with his tail between his legs, Spot put
on his special agent undercover collar and headed down-town, stopping every
so often to leave his customary calling card at his favorite fire-hydrants.
<p>
<I>The author comments, "Hopefully some wag will add to this."</I>

<h3>Jacquelin Le Dogge begins a Timmy Tuckerman, Toddler Detective(tm) novel 10/25/96</h3>
<h4>TIMMY TUCKERMAN, TODDLER DETECTIVE and The Mystery of the Missing Red Block</h4>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
As Timmy Tuckerman arose from his nap at the Jack'N'Jill Preschool where 
he was an outstandingly precocious student, he noticed right off the bat 
that something was amiss.  The freckle-faced tot, known by his teacher to 
be the most successfully toilet-trained tot in his group, and who washed 
his hands like a good little boy without having to be scolded, knew all 
his colors and could recognize most of his numerals on sight.  Letting his 
innocent baby-blue eyes wander to the pile of blocks, he was quick to spot 
that the red block with the number three prominently embossed on its side 
was nowhere to be seen on the lower shelf where it was usually kept along 
with all the other blocks and some of the Lego blocks.  Timmy was sure it 
had been there earlier when Miss Swinford had read her usually rousing 
rendition of "Mrs. Wiggs and the Cabbage Patch", a tale that usually held 
the charming little tot in thrall, though after several readings in the 
last month the plot was wearing a little thin for his sensitive taste. 
A potential anal-retentive type in years to come, the chubby cherub was 
more than somewhat distressed by the glaring gap between the blue and green 
blocks which he had painstakingly aligned earlier that morning during 'free 
play', a time used by larger tykes to bully their weaker chums into relinquishing 
their mid-morning milk and cookies, but a time Timmy had painstakingly 
set aside to further structure his already ordered world and thus win Miss 
Swinford's undying admiration. 
<p>
Timmy looked around at his still-dozing 
chums and wondered who the culprit might be.  Was it Otis Orblemyer, who 
still sucked his thumb despite the teasing of his peer group and had twice 
wet himself while teeter-tottering?  Was it Muffie Brendlesnip, known by 
one and all to be a notorious tattle-tale and nose-picker?  Or perhaps it 
was Tristan Peebles, who had perpetually sticky hands and who lisped in 
a peculiarly irritating way.  Timmy couldn't be sure, but he vowed that 
before the class was forced to watch another episode of <em>Sesame Street</em>, 
he'd find out!
<p>
<I>The author comments,</I> "Enough of these teen detective 
stories!  Now that children are being pushed to achieve at an increasingly earlier 
age, let's give them some real responsibilities!"

<h3><a href=mailto:finnegan@netdoor.com>The Convivial Codfish</a> begins a gothic novel 10/16/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">

It was a dark and ominous castle, resting in a dank and moist valley filled with unwholesome vapors and unpleasant mists that lent a  chill to the air even of the days and nights of the height of summer and that caused the fungus  to grow with rank vigor even upon the very stones of Greycastle Manor; the sight of which manor's dark grey exterior,  dripping walls, sagging rooflines, and windows besmirched with the grime of a hundred generations filled me with a dark foreboding that I would get to know intimately all the repairmen of the surrounding environs.

<h3>Nancy Blue begins a Madcap Girl Detective novel 10/15/96</h3>
Young Molly MacGruder sighed as she slipped her convertible into drive
and eased out into traffic, "Sometimes I worry about you, Brandi Kirk.
Oh, you may be renowned as a crack mystery solver, and the mayor may
have given you the keys to the city. But the way you toss your hair in
that devil-may-care attitude of yours, I wonder if you won't be the next
casualty in <em>The Mystery of the Missing Menses</em>"
<p>
Brandi blinked, her madcap crop of ginger locks dancing in the wind. 
"Why Molly! I may be jaded and loose. But I always know where my
protection is."  She patted her purse protectively.  "And I don't mean my
pearl handled Derringer.  Don't you remember how I pulled us through that
sticky situation at the All-Nighter Hotel in <em>The Case of the Concealed
Contraceptive</em>?   Now not another word about me!   We've only got ten
minutes to get across town, find you a more flattering dress, and meet
that scrumptious District Attorney at the Gallery Opening.   I'm sure he
holds the answers to <em>The Pink Panty Puzzler</em> and I'm going to pry them
out of him if it's the last thing I do!"

<h3>Hermione Clevecourt begins a Bitsy Bankridge (tm) novel 10/15/96</h3>
<h4>Bitsy Bankridge in <u>The Case Of the Sinister Handbag</u></h4> 
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through
butter, or a spoon through jello.
  "Golly, no, Joel!" cried Bitsy Bankridge, famous teen detective, as she ran a despairing hand through her locks of curly gold.  She shook her head in alarm as she watched her athletic cousin disappear beneath the placid waters of the Forest Hills reservoir.  "That boy will be the death of his mother, my Aunt Elizabeth Ann Bankridge-Vermont," she exclaimed, her madcap hands planted firmly to the hips from which a stunning A-line sunfrock in freshly-pressed yellow and blue cotton with a yummy floral pattern hung. 
<p>
Mary Murgatroyd looked doubtfully at her chum. "Swimming is good exercise, Bitsy, isn't it?  I lost three pounds swimming last summer."
 <p>
 Bitsy winked good naturedly at her plump friend.  "And gained it all back eating the nougat chocolates Captain Wilberforce of the Forest Hills Police sent me in a platonic gesture of friendship after I solved <em>The Case of the Mobile Mannequin</em>, didn't you?  Of all people, Mary, you should know that swimming so soon after a snack - even a light repast of  grapes in lime gelatin with salad dressing, celery boats with peanut butter, a malted, and wholesome fried potatos (Nature's natural energy food!) - can lead to debilitating stomach cramps and coma!  Why, remember?  That's how we caught the crook in <em>The Mystery of the Tapping Stiletto Heels</em>?"

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">

"Oh, fudge", Mary cried as her roadster sputtered to the curbside.  
"My radiator is leaking", the attractive slender young woman realized, 
"and I'll never get to the hop in time to meet Stan!".<p>
  "Oh Mary!" exclaimed Bitsy Bankridge, the girl detective with the 
locks of curly gold. "Forget Stan. Besides, as I showed you in <em>The
Case of the Dress-Left Dummy</em>, there's nothing a girl <em>can't</em>
do with her hairpin!" With a mischievous wink, the bubbly girl detective
jimmied open the hood of the roadster and before her nail-biting chum 
could say the word 'Moxie', she had repaired the naughty radiator and 
replaced three of the spark plugs. "There!" she said with all the conviction of a girl who had been voted Miss Forest Hills Intellectual Girl three years running. "Now we're off to finish <em>The Case of the Gibbering Ghost!</em>"<p> Mary looked doubtful. "Oh Bitsy," she cried mournfully. "You'll never catch a husband with those dirty fingernails!"
<p>
<h3>Inlaw Tolerator <a name="bitsy2">continues</a> 10/15/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
'Besides' she added, almost as a slowly formed afterthought, 'wasn't it
in <em>The Mystery of the Half-Hearted Coiffure</em> that you used your hairpin
to save us from disaster?  When evil old Mr. Green was going to turn
Bab's Beauty Boutique into a counterfeiting operation, and you saved
Babs and me from that horrid basement just before the explosion?'
<p>
Bitsy smiled a tolerant smile at her long-time friend, and tossed her
head, letting her crop of unruly golden curls bounce in the gentle
breeze coming in through the roadster's open window.  'We mustn't call
Mr Green 'evil', Mary.  He was just misguided and unable to make good
choices.  And you know, you and Babs were never in danger in that
basement.  You could have used the heel of your pump to excavate the
loose mortar around the one window, if you'd remembered what I showed
you in <em>The Case of the Wandering Wallet</em>'
<p>
Bitsy's much-needed tutorial was cut painfully short, however, by the
abrupt appearance of a ghostly spectre which suddenly loomed in the
headlights of the roadster.  Mary slammed on the brakes, her eyes wide,
'Oh, Bitsy' she exclaimed, 'Why do you have to have such a knack for
mysteries?'
<p>
<h3>Eustacia Herringbone <a name="bitsy3">continues</a> 10/26/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
        Smoothing her tousled golden curls deftly back into place, Bitsy
smiled a little less-tolerantly, but still within the bounds of friendship,
at the agitated Mary.

<p>        "Oh, Mary!" she exclaimed, "Some of us just have a natural talent
for solving mysteries, so naturally mysteries which cry out to be solved
will just naturally be attracted to us. Why, I would be severely shirking
my duties if I didn't attempt to solve them."

<p>        Mary, momentarily distracted by the lumbering figure of the spectre
approaching
them, opened wide her red lips (which she had carefully highlighted with
just the right shade of lipstick to complement her rosy cheeks) and
screamed while closing her bright blue eyes so that her carefully curled
and mascaraed lashes interlocked with the proper degree of tightness to
prepare for the worst.

<p>        "Open your eyes, Mary," said her more-confident comrade, "and
you'll see that what you perceive as a ghost is none other than Stan in his
Halloween outfit. If you'll remember <em>The Mystery of the Spectral Sweater</em>,
you'll realize that a ghost does not leave foot-prints. Especially not with
size ten crepe-soled saddle oxfords like Stan wears."

<p>        "Oh, Phooey!" said Stan, as he approached the roadster. "I really
thought I had you girls going. I waited around at the hop for what seemed
like forever. The other guys were kidding me that you'd stood me up. Why,
you wouldn't believe some of the things they said about you!"

<p>        "Now, now," admonished Bitsy, careful of bruising Stan's insecure
male ego, "a true gentleman doesn't spread gossip." Still, she was a bit
curious about what the guys had been saying, though she'd never admit it.
Instead, she tossed her naturally golden curls flirtatiously in Stan's
direction. What he saw in Mary, she'd never know.

<p>        Before she could engage him in some light-hearted banter, the
conversation was cut short when a speeding black sedan rounded the curve
behind them and side-swiped the roadster. Fortunately, Bitsy was able to
yank Stan into the rumble seat and out of harm's way.

<p>        "Wow, Bitsy, said Stan with a note of admiration in his still-shaky
voice, "where did you learn to do that?"

<p>        "If you'd read <em>The Case of the Bouncing Bandit</em>, you'd know,"
answered Bitsy coyly. "But," she added, "did you see that car? All the
windows were painted black.We'd better see what they're up to. Step on it,
Mary!"

<p>        Knowing it was useless to disagree with her knowledgeable chum,
Mary revved up the roadster and took off in hot pursuit, while Stan
scrambled to an upright position in the rumble seat, the better to admire
the way Bitsy's golden curls blew in the wind.

The entrance to the underground city was beautiful, but the unknown below seemed to drown all that out.  Travis and David stepped down the large stairs and entered a great room that was brightly lighted from the grated ceiling fixtures.  There were skeletons everywhere.  A great battle had taken place here.  The broken bodies were unlike any human forms.  Some were long and skinny, others were thick as tanks.  Many skeletons were heavily armored but to no avail, the skulls were crushed or the bodies were mangled regardless of the armour.  The carnage jolted the two explorers.  They wondered what went wrong here.  David was looking with a curious stare at the walls.  There were great paintings which fortold some of the history of these misshapen monstrosities.  
<p>
In each of the paintings were the armoured human-looking creatures in hunting parties or on collecting expeditions.  Each scene was basically the same but the backgrounds and creatures being hunted changed drastically.  In one scene, the armoured creatures appeared to be in a purple underwater landscape using giant nets to captures huge crablike creatures.  In another scene they were in the shooting leathery winged creatures out of a dark red sky.  Something stranger than normal in the drawing was the two suns in the background.  One was red and the other was a coppery color with big black spots on it.  In other paintings were some of the creatures Travis and David had seen on their trip to the ruins.  They both got a chill.  What in the hell was going on here.  Who were these armoured creatures.  Where did they come from.  What were they doing here in the jungle.   
<p>
David took out his video camera and started filming.  Travis narrated their findings having more questions than answers.  They were walking down the main corridor when they heard a scraping noise from above.  When they looked up they could see one of the crablike creatures staring down at them through the gold grating.  It looked a little smaller than the ones in the paintings.  Were the creatures mating and this was one of their offspring.  Travis hoped not.  Its pincher struck at the grating with but did not break through.  The six eyed crustacean drooled foamy saliva from its teeth riddled mouth.  Travis and David were revolted by the design of the creature thankful however for the gold grating which separated them from it.  David thought he would never be able to eat lobster again.  They ran cautiously down the corridor to escape the multiple eyes of the creature.  In the next room they found what appeared to be a kithcen.  There were geometrically shaped pots and pans all around the floor and vials with strange powders in the honeycombed racks on the wall.  There was a clickity-clackity sound coming from the hallway.  Travis turned and saw two crab-creatures moving sideways down the hall toward them.  There were two doors out of the kitchen, one toward the crabs the other next to that same door but going down another corridor.  Travis ran for the door yelling for David to follow him.  David was too late though, by the time he was running for the door the first crab entered the room cutting him off from the exit.  Travis yelled for David but he knew he was trapped.  David took aim at the crab which blocked his exit toward Travis and shot three times.  Each bullet richocheted off of the creatures shelled body.  They were starting to close in on David.  Travis yelled at the creatures to divert their attention but they knew where easy prey was.  Clickity-clack.  Clickity-clack.  They started around the giant stove crushing pots and pans that were in their way with their powerful pinchers.  From behind Travis <p>
The crabs were closing in.  David looked for a way to make it to the doors but there was no way.  Directly behind him was what appeared to be a garbage chute.  Clickity-Clack.  Snap. Snap.  He turned and opened the chute.  Barely enough room but what laid at the bottom of the chute and how far down did it go?  Clickity-Clack.  David jumped into the chute as the crabs lunged at him.  He was sliding down as he heard the crabs rip off the chute door in dispair.  They were too big to follow.  David slid down farther and farther into blackness. 
<p>
<h3><a href=mailto:The1drer@aol.com>Wondering Fool</a> <a name="tracy6">continues</a> 10/05/96</h3>

While David was sliding into the bowels of the earth, 
Travis was running for his life.  The third crab-creature went for Travis 
after seeing David's narrow escape.  Travis never felt so alone in his life.  
He thought David was killed by the giant crustaceans and he was alone in 
this forboding labyrinth.  He ran for his life.  He didn't care about the 
lost civilization or the fortunes they bestowed.  He just wanted to live 
to see another day.
<p>
Somehow he managed to make it to an exit at the rear of the underground 
city.  The change in humidity seemed to drain his remaining strength, but 
he knew he had to keep running.  In the distance he could hear the 
approaching malformed crabs.  He sprinted for the area that he and David 
climb into the courtyard, but the trees providing his escape had been 
knocked down.  He was trapped in the courtyard with the crabs.  
They must have knocked down the trees to prevent his escape.  
They emerged from the subterranian city foaming at their mouths more than 
before.  The creatures advanced on him swiftly.  He thought of his family 
and how he embedded in their minds to never give up, no matter what the 
odds were.  He looked to his left and saw a door to one of the guard 
towers, but he saw something else as well.  He just hoped his plan would 
work.  He ran for the guard tower but the crabs saw this and quickly 
scurried to block the entrance.  When he was thirty feet away, 
he broke right and sprinted for a vine that hung against the wall.  
He just prayed that it would hold his weight or he would be dead.  
The largest of the foam-spewing creatures saw his plan and sidestepped 
with its pinchers snapping so fast that Travis thought he saw sparks 
coming from them.  It was ten feet and closing.  "All or nothing.", 
Travis thought and jumped onto the vine.  It holds.  
He starts to climb up when the claws tear at his pants.  
He could feel deep cuts in the flesh of his leg as the creature seeks 
purchase.  He reaches higher and pulls himself up two more feet.  
The strike of the claw was not aimed with percision, 
therefore it couldn't grasp Travis to pull him down.  
He climbed as fast as he could blocking out the pain coming from the wound.  
The creature grabbed at the vine and started to snap at it in a frenzied 
attempt to pull it down.  As Travis reached the top, he could hear the 
frustrated mewling sound of the crab-creatures.  He didn't stick around to 
see if they could pursue him any further.  
<p>
He found a log down to the outside of...<p>
 <i>To the author - this part got 
snipped out.  The line length in the form must be finite - add some 
carriage returns next time.  Where you want a real paragraph break, add two for a blank line.</i><p>

He always told his son stories of his adventures.  
Sometimes he embellished them to make them more facinating for the boy, 
but when he told this story, he said everything was true.  
Michael, of course, had a hard time believing everything in the 
story but he was so intrigued that he had to find out for himself.  
His wife Tracy heard the story as well and saw the strange gold ingots t
hat Travis brought back.  They decided that they would follow in Travis' 
tracks but would bring back the video that he couldn't.  
Travis was gravely ill from the wound to his leg.  
Infection of an unusual sort was taking effect around the cut leaving a 
green pus-filled streak.  Doctors were baffled and were doing research on 
the biopsy.  
<p>
Michael and Tracy met in the Himalayas at a base camp.  
They were spending a couple of days at the base camp to get acclimated to the altitude before the rest of their mountain climbing party arrived.  They knew of eachother through mutual friends but they met on that fateful trip.  A day before their ascent there was an avalance that buried a team of six returning from the summit.  Michael, Tracy and two others organized a search and rescue team.  Michael was  very impressed with Tracy on her leadership qualities and her quick thinking.  Thanks to Tracy they saved four of the six on that freezing mountain.  In middle of all the conflagration, they fell in love.  That lead them on many journeys but none quite as hellish as this.
