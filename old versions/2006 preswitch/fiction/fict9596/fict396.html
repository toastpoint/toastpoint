<h3>Cassandra A. Goduti begins a 
Young Adult mystery novel 3/30</h3>
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I
would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
My friends, Josclyn and Alex  - missing. I don't know where I
lost them,
they just disappeared while we were walking.  The doors creaked
to the castle,
sounding like fingernails scratching a chalkboard.  Cobwebs  hung
at every
corner and in front of almost every doorway.  If I hadn't been so
foolish,
I would have never have gotten us into this mess.  If it hadn't
been for 
that stupid bet.  Now I had to find my friends to leave.  It
never occurred
to me until now, that leaving may not be an option.  My palms
began to sweat,
Could I possible leave without my friends?  This castle holds
tales that I said
I could uncover because I didn't believe this house to be haunted
or possessed,
just lived in by someone none of us knew.  The number of people I
had seen coming
and going from this castle out of strange doors and corners, just
didn't appear
right to me. I just have to tread carefully.

MikeAce</a> begins a 
Science Fiction novel 3/29</h3>
"Life's tough in this town", Marley thought, wincing as he
labored to 
extract the bullet fragment from his thigh.  
It was moments later he learned that this was no bullet.  
It was the thorn in his side called "Sin".  
"How did this town come so far from the truth?  
How did I?"  
<p>
The cool night air rushed into his lungs as
he gasped for another breath of life.  
This was no literal thorn in his thigh nor a bullet - it was his
old friend Jack.  
Jack never left his side in all these years.  Yeah, good old Jack
Daniels.  
Marley took another look at Jack and said "You been with me all
these years and never left my side.  
You are a true friend".  
Marley struggled one last time to kiss his longtime companion
good-bye.
<p>
His soul separates from his body and he meets the 
one who really hid behind the name Jack Daniels.  
This friend is called .....

"Life's tough in this town", Marley thought, wincing as he
labored to 
extract the bullet fragment from his thigh.  
"Those boys should have thought a little longer about their plan 
to rob you" stated Deputy Bob. "It's tough being the barber in
this 
town along with being the sheriff and the mayor" replied Marley. 
"Whats we gonna do with them there dead bodies lying in the
street over 
yonder?" Bob asked.  
"We'll throw them in the river after we's had our self some grits
and 
steak."

Science Fiction novel 3/28</h3>

The house had lain dormant for decades, perched there on Coogan's
Bluff. Nothing had
disturbed its slumber since the burning time.  
That is, until now. The Brianites were a rare breed of 
Extra-Terrestrials from the planet Bob. 
In addition to their repulsive appearance, the 
Brianites lacked even the slightest amount of 
real intelligence and quite often lost their way in the 
universe when attempting to explore their own planet. 
The small group of Brianites flew from galaxy to galaxy, 
searching for their home of Bob. 
Alas, the Brianites gave up their search for planet Bob and 
settled for a place of similar consistency; Earth. 
"What is this?" Captain Brian1 asked his fellow Brianites, 
lowering the ship in front of the deserted house. 
"It appears to be a silent, harmless mass, Captain." 
Brian2, the wisest, carefully observed. 
The Brianites stared in awe at this sight as they gathered around
the 
windows. "Then we must attack it!" Captain Brian1 triumphantly
exclaimed.

With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a 
knife through butter, or a spoon through jello.  
At first, moving through what he thought was water was easy.  
As he continued he felt a slight resistance through every 
stroke.  He noticed that the water was turning from a clear 
blue to a mint green color before his eyes.  
All of a sudden a dark green shadow was beneath him in the 
water.  He immediately started to flail around in the 
solidifying mint green substance.

Daniel</a> begins a 
Horror novel 3/20</h3>
"Oh, fudge," Mary cried as her roadster sputtered to the
curbside.  
"My radiator is leaking," the attractive slender young woman
realized, 
"and I'll never get to the hop in time to meet Stan!".  
"I can't mess things up, Stan is the best man I've ever met", she
thought. 
In a sudden shock of self-pity, 
Mary got out of the car, sat down on the rough gravel, and cried. 

As cars rushed by, her tears turned to 
puddles. 
<p>
Suddenly, an old Ford van stopped to give her aid.  
A charming young man rolled down the window and
asked "Do you need a ride somewhere, babe?"  
Mary's world suddenly got bright again.  She jumped in the
passenger's seat 
and thanked the nice young man.  All she could think about was
Stan, 
and how she longed to be with him.  A big smile appeared, as well
as a strong 
feeling of euphoria.  "I can't thank you enough for 
giving me a ride!",  Mary shouted.  
The young man replied in a cocky voice "This ride ain't free,
lady".  And  
stopped the van. 
<p>
Before Mary could react, a hand from behind her appeared and
pulled her to 
the rear of the 
vehicle.  She began to scream while being stripped of her blouse. 

The driver and another young man began
to pull off her tight jeans.  Wearing only a bra and panties, 
Mary began squirm.  The driver began to punch 
her in the stomach while his friend kicked her crotch repeatedly. 

After beating her to a slight squirm, they peeled off her
panties, 
it was a group effort, and they liked what they saw.

Mythletoe</a> begins a 
Mystery 3/20</h3>
With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through
butter, or a spoon through jello.  
The crowd gasped when a the water became tie-dyed with crimson. 
Joel's
body floated to the top like a dead fish.  A woman screamed at
the sight
and the onlookers hushed.  
<p>
Joel's sister set aside her grief for the moment
and took charge of the situation as her cop instincts had told
her to do.
She dashed down to poolside and dove in to retrieve the body. 
She
dragged the limp corpse to the dry cement and examined the wound. 
She
found that it was a bullet hole.  "Who would have shot Joel?",
she asked
herself although she knew the answer.  She looked up at the crowd
for
some clue and spotted a man running toward the gates.  She knew 
there was no way for her to catch him, so she stayed with the
body.  
Security guards came rushing at her and she withdrew her soggy
badge
from her back pocket and informed them that she was Detective
Joline
Barnsworth, the victim's sister.  She told them that she saw what
she 
thought was the assailant running out and a screech of tires
confirmed her 
suspicions.   "Why had Joel gotten himself mixed up with those
thugs?"
she asked herself.

<h3>CB begins a Harlequin Romance 3/18/96</h3>
She knew, as the sand-laden wind swept a tumbleweed over the
trunk of
her '79 Nova, that Eduardo would not come back.  
Damn!  Not that he was that good a deal, but she had used up the
dough she 
got when Sam, that sonuvabitch, put her Camaro in a ditch and she
still 
owed Tiffany for the bikini-line electrolysis.  Now she had to
look for 
work.  Maybe get drunk first, though.

<h3>Dean Cooze begins a Pulp Novel 3/3</h3>
Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane
of
hair, Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and barked with
her
trademark raucous, sneering laughter - 
laughter known to have unmanned many
a suitor.  
"Fred, get the hell out here!", she snarled, grinding the 
butt beneath her spiked heel.
<p>
"Whuh" came the sound from the bathroom.  Rolling her eyes, Thyla
whumped 
on the door and said "Hurry up, you asshole, we'll be late!  And
we don't 
want Moldy in our face."  A muffled expletive was heard as the
toilet flushed and 
Fred, bleary-eyed stumbled out in a cloud of foul odor.  "Geez,
you stinking 
pig!  Whadya eat last night, burritos?" Thyla sneered as she
stomped out of the room.
