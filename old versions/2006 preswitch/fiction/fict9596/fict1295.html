If you are inspired to write a sequel paragraph to an entry, feel free.  
We could end up with a multi-hypertexted novel from hell!  Until I can 
figure out how to make the forms do this, specify which author's 
paragraph you are continuing.

<h3>Mista Wizard begins a Coming of Age novel 12/28</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
'Damn!' Sachelle cried, cursing her bruised thumb and the world in general.  
'Now I'll never be able to win at table tennis!'  Sachelle was the best 
table tennis player at all of Eastmont High, and Sarah the snotty senior 
knew it.  As of yet she hadn't had a chance to prove her skill, but 
she was looking forward to playing in the super tournament that would be 
taking place the very next day.  Johnny would be there, 
Johnny with his beautiful smile and taste for young meat.  
Johnny, the seventy year old janitor, who Sachelle had had a crush on 
since she first laid eyes on him.  She wanted to show him just how great 
she was, how she had worked so hard at the table tennis courts.  
She had finally gone straight and joined the team rather than hustling 
to pay for her collection of Star Trek commemorative coins.  Now that she 
had given those up, now that she was finally about to show her 
skill to everybody, this happened!  She knew she shouldn't press 
elevator buttons so hard, but now she was bruised.  She could never play 
the tournament in this shape.  What was she going to do?  This was, 
like, a total disaster!

<h3>Michael Miester writes a Baby-Sitter's Club horror novel 12/28</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  

I found it out soon enough as I went to tuck in the youngest Windvere, 
whom it was my job to watch over as a full-fledged member of the 
baby-sitter's club.  He begged to stay up to watch the last of 
Get Smart, but I agreed only on the condition that he tell me 
the ancient, dank history of his castle.  <p>
I wanted to know why Kristie and the others were so 
eager to give it to me.  "Dank?"  he asked questioningly.  
"How can a history be Dank?"  "Shut up you little bastard," 
I responded in my best tone of authority.  "So," he said after 
a moment of silence, his bright red eyes glowing (Yeah, red!  
I guess they're contacts).  "It began way back in history, 
with my ancestors Paul and Uma Windvere, and me, Mike D."  
I warned him to stop with the Beastie Boys lyrics, and 
had to stick his fingers in the socket a few times to stop.  
And they said I couldn't babysit!  <p>
"Okay, okay.  My ancestors built the castle with their own hands.  
The stained glass of the front windows were stained with their 
very blood and sweat."  I told him reasonably that you couldn't 
stain glass with blood and sweat, and held his head under water for 
several minutes to prove my point.  "Well, you get ahead of me," said the 
little runt when he finished gasping for breath.  
"They had a secret glass staining formula, which was very lucrative.  
Because human blood is cheaper than other red dyes."  That made sense.  
"One day," he continued, "a babysitter was watching over some of my 
other ancestors, who were children at the time.  She stole the formula 
for the glass staining, and sold it to a competitor.  
When my first ancestors, Uma and Paul, discovered what had happened, 
they took the babysitter and... DIDN'T PAY HER!"  <p>
I gasped in sheer horror.  Not paid!  For putting up with one of the 
little slime balls of the Windveres!  The agony!  Sure, there was some 
pizza in the bargain, but it was well known that the Windveres all ordered 
Veggie Lovers.  And man, I can't eat a pizza with anything green on it.  
So I'm just geting dicked!  I screamed in stark denial, and the kid 
laughed maniacally.  This went on for a while, until I got bored and 
shoved his head under the water and his finger in the socket at the 
same time.  The smell of burning Care Bears pajamas filled the room.  
But man!  That history was so dank and ancient, I thought to myself.  
If someone had written about my experiences and entered them into a 
book, he deserved obscene amounts of money.  <p>
As I thought this to myself, 
an eerie, translucent figure approached me from the hallway.  
His gaping maw was such that it reminded me of the stained glass front 
doors.  "It is fitting that I should remind you of the doors," the 
ghostly figure said.  "Because I am the ghost of Uma, come to revenge 
myself on every babysitter who kills one of my blood!"  
"Every babysitter?"  I asked, my curiousity getting the better of my 
palapable fear.  "Am I not the only one?"  "No," said the ghost in a 
horrible and yet cheesy ghostly voice, "the children of my family are all 
unmanagable little bastards."  "Ah," I said.  
And then the ghost killed me, making me sorry I found out about the 
ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere.

Erk</a> begins a Harlequin Romance 12/21</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The house had lain dormant for decades, perched there on Coogan's Bluff.  Nothing 
had disturbed its slumber since the burning time.  
Now, however, the mansion trembled with the burning passion of two lovers,
caught inexorably into a web of hot, moist undeniable excitement. Their
moans traveled through the rooms like a mobile hot dog on a stick - 
bobbing, oily, warm and firm, and eventually dying down 
to a few greasy smears on a napkin.
<p>
Smiling obscurely, half in agony from the dust-induced asthma attack, Mike
leaned tenderely against a rotting board and smiled. Carefully he traced
his shapely, tapered finger across his lover's shoulder. His very touch
caused his partner to arch in ecstasy. "I love you more than sausages," he 
wheezed.

Jeff Gilson</a> begins a Coming of Age novel 12/20</h3>
Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane of
hair, Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and barked with her
trademark raucous, sneering laughter - laughter known to have unmanned many
a suitor.  
She had had several since junior high.  Now, as a Freshman in high school, 
she had to prove to herself that she was worthy of the name, Thyla.
It had been her mother's name.  Her mother had just died three years before, 
at the ripe old age of twenty-eight.  Thyla wanted her mother to know 
how much she cared, now that her mother was in heaven.  
Thyla knew how much the family name depended on her 
furthering the line, and she wanted to make sure she was able 
to do it before she was seventeen.<p>
Thyla spotted another likely candidate, a Senior who would do 
anyone at any time.  She walked over to him.

The Purring Litigator</a> begins a Courtroom Drama 12/16</h3>
Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane of
hair, Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and barked with her
trademark raucous, sneering laughter - laughter known to have unmanned many
a suitor.  
She knew they were all waiting inside for her, that her testimony 
was the key to uncovering the motive for this tragedy.   
But she didn't care.   This was her day.   The television cameras were 
already in the room.   The reporters perched at their seats.   
Most importantly, the Senator would finally get what he deserved.   
The bailiff opened the door, and in she walked.   All heads turned.

<h3>Alabaster Cat begins a horror novel 12/14</h3>
'Damn!' Sachelle cried, cursing her bruised thumb and the world in general.  
She sucked on her thumb and realized she had severed it off.  
"Oh, shit!" she exclaimed as the blood spurted all over the walls 
in the kitchen done all in brown.
She called Michael on the phone with her unhurt hand and told him 
to get his butt over here. <p>

"Yes, your majesty." he replied and hung up.<p>

Sachelle thought to herself, "Too bad poor Michael won't leave this house. 
It will be a shame
to do him in..." as she fingered the blade of the butcher knife and 
claws popped out of her face.
<p>
"Yes, a perfect shame." she said aloud as her skin turned green, 
her eyes multiplied, and her hair
fell out in tangled clumps.  She grabbed the 
butcher knife and crouched near the door to wait.

Smynra Oakes</a> begins a Baby-Sitter's Club novel 12/12</h3>
'Damn!' Sachelle cried, cursing her bruised thumb and the world in general.
The other girls tittered.  "What's the matter, Sachy?" giggled Natoli, leader
of the New Rochelle Daughters of Sicily Baby Sitters Club.
<p>
Sachelle pouted with coral-lined lips as she smoothed the fabric of her
Versace jumper. "Eleven years old and no breasts yet! What the hell is Bruno
going to do on our date Saturday when he finds oranges in my training bra!"
<p>
"Oh, grow up," Myra Spizzicola said cooly as she ran taloned fingers 
through her freshly-bleached hair. "Even Natoli's flat, and at thirteen 
she's older than us all. Anyway, you said you'd babysit the Marco brats
for me Saturday." At Sachelle's silent refusal, she snarled, "Well,
<em>someone</em> has to do some babysitting around here or else how're we
gonna pay for the hit on that bitch Amanda White? Do you want her winning 
the science fair again this year?"

<h3><a href=mailto:mike_stanley@ny.jackmorton.com>
Alien</a> begins some Amphibious Fiction 12/11</h3>
The frogs chirped in anticipation as Beavis wheeled his rig into the swamp.  
"The lilypads will be hopping tonight, boys" exclaimed Freddie the 
Frog-King to a quivering chorus of amphibian croaking.  
Little did the critters know that the night would end in utter tragedy...

<h3>Erk begins a British Tea novel 12/5</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

She knew, as the sand-laden wind swept a tumbleweed over the trunk of
her '79 Nova, that Eduardo would not come back.  "Well," she thought, 
"as Granny always said, there isn't anything which can't be
fixed by a lovely cup of tea." As she eased the antique 
Wedgwood teapot out of the
hole in the back seat and carefully siphoned some water off her cooling tank,
she smiled in anticipation of the perfectly-blended English tea.
<p>
Suddenly, her chemical imbalance got the best of her and she hurled the teapot
furiously against the rapidly turning tumbleweed. "Damn it anyway!" she screamed.
"I don't even like tea! I like coffee! Black!" Kicking the tires, she flung 
herself into the hot sand and wept.
<p>
"If Eduardo had loved me, he would have bought me coffee..." she sobbed. "Not 
gone off for a Coke..."

<h3>Stephen Kling writes 12/2</h3>
The house had lain dormant for decades, perched there on Coogan's Bluff.  Nothing 
had disturbed its slumber since the burning time.  The windows gazed watchfully on 
the sleepy town of Marvin Hamlet - protecting?  Plotting?  A cold wind set the 
crunchy autumn leaves dancing down the gravel road as two figures worked 
their way up the hill.<p>
"It's owned by the nephew of the family that lived there", Sadie explained as 
she huffed and puffed, "but he's never out here.  I'm sure he'd let it go for a 
song.  But why are you...".  She stopped as she saw the look in the stranger's eye.  
"I need a house.  This house." he said shortly, ending the conversation.
