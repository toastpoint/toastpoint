<h3><a href=mailto:danieloconnaughton@yahoo.com>TS O'Rama</a> begins a Science Fiction novel 01/16/98</h3>

  Recently I visited the famous Steinbergs Memorial in Lebanon,
 Pennsylvania. It was partly out of curiosity and partly out of fear. You
 see, the monument was modelled after some long lost sketches by the
 great Leonardo Da Vinci (a great Steinberg himself) who claimed that if
 his drawings were constructed in exact detail, anyone who approached the
 monument could discover for him/herself if they were indeed worthy of
 the name "Steinbergs".
<p>
   Desirous of knowing whether I could rightfully be called a "steinberg"
 by my friends, I paid the $38 round trip bus fare from columbus and
 headed out on an overcast and foggy morning. I did not know what to
 expect - I didn't even know what the monument looked like! - but I felt
 like somehow this trip would change my life forever. With such thoughts
 going madly through my head, I looked down at the crossword puzzle that
 I had clipped out of the Saturday morning Columbus Dogpatch. It was a
 daily ritual of mine to slaughter the various mind games that were
 printed out on the thin rag paper. Having long since tired of solving
 the CW puzzle the regular way, I now forced myself to fill in the
 squares with synonyms of antonyms depending on my mood. But no mixing
 was allowed. It made things difficult if, halfway through the puzzle my
 mood changed, because I really was more adept at figuring out antonyms
 to words when I was content and relatively happy and synonyms when I
 felt ornery and generally ant-social. (A shrink once told me that I had
 a displaced personality which explained my objective look at how I was
 NOT feeling at any particular time.)
<p>
   Anyway, I had been relatively content until I noticed that my former
 choice of entries to the puzzle had forced me to come up with an antonym
 for the clue "split ends" that was 5 letters long and had a "c", "z", and
 "k" in it. This was mildly distressing, but it was all that was needed to
 put me over the edge and into a gloomy frame of mind. I resolved to look
 through my foreign language dictionary collection to come up with an
 answer later, and then folded that paper up and put it in my jacket
 pocket. Luckily, we were almost there so I woke up the pretty young woman
 who had asked to use my shoulder as a head rest during the trip (she
 ended up slumped over asleep in my lap), and brushed a small pool of
 saliva off of my pants. She thought it was funny and said, "Your cotton
 pants and leg remind me of my pillow so I must've really dropped off!"
<p>
   I ignored the oddity of her remark and got off the bus feeling a little
 stiff from the 3 hour ride. The monument was in the center of town. I
 could see a crowd of people around it about 100 yards from where I stood.
 As I approached, I was amazed at the quietness of the large group of
 people gathered there, and let out an almost involuntary "Steinbergs!" to
 liven the people up. Immediately, I heard a few people to begin crying,
 and an elderly man turned to me and said, "Don't you have any sympathy? I
 can see you are not a true "steinberg" either so you of all people should
 understand their pain!"
<p>
   Only then did I notice the memorial. Only then ded I understand. And
 only then did I not understand. I realized that I was not yet one of that
 hallowed band of scholars, musicians, and free thinkers. I was confused.
 How could this be? I mean, I can do English crossword puzzles in 4
 languages; I'm a successful computer programmer who truly understands the
 difference between comp-3 and comp-5 data representation; I read
 vociferously on current topics and classical themes. I looked at my
 unenlightened reflection in the memorial and cried.
<p>
   To understand my dismay, let me briefly describe the Steinberg
 Memorial. It appeared, at first glance, to be a large slab of polished
 granite. The granite was very dark and of exquisite grain and quality.
 (I learned later that it was discovered about 100 feet below the rock
 strewn surface of Toucanman Ravine in the White Mountains of New
 Hampshire. Geology students analyzing core samples found the matchless
 underground rock formation.) As one got closer, it became a mirror that
 seemed to engulf you. The angles and dimensions had been precisely laid
 out, and their intricacy became very apparent upon micro inspection. The
 monument was designed so that the reflection was an all-encompassing
 three dimensioal view of the area in front. I said that I could see
 myself but that is only half true - my reflection was a hideous
 representation of what I really looked like. True "steinbergs" looked
 normal, but most of us non-steinbergs looked just plain hideous. There
 was one guy reflected there who had huge locks of nosehair billowing out
 and blowing in the breeze that reached down to his ankles. One female
 non-steinie looked like a simple stick figure that you would draw on
 paper except tht she had feet for hands - they looked to be size 18! My
 reflection was twisted so that I looked like I was made of a couple of
 large elastic bands that had been twisted into a quasi-human form. It was
 disarming, and I stood frozen in shock for a moment. The true steinbergs
 reflections ded not seem to be any different than a normal reflection,
 but they stood there for a long while contemplating themselves and I
 wondered what THEY saw.
<p>
   I walked away. I needed time to think. Would I ever enjoy a good
 steinbergs joke again? Could I possibly change the current course of events
 and by so doing become a respected member of that elite group? But it was
 time to get something to eat.
<p>
   I took a circuitous route back to the eatery "Guerny's Time-Killer Cafe".
 I wanted to avoid the image that resonated in my head - the image of myself
 represented in the Steinberg mirror of shame. The mirror made me look like
 I'd been shoveled between two pile irons; like a human representation of
 the Flatironz building in New York. I arrived at the Cafe and was relieved
 to see no mirrors - nothing that could possibly again bring back the
 Steinbergian horror. Still, with subtle glances I perused the faces of
 those at the Cafe...wondering who were steinbergs and who weren't. My
 curiosity led me to ask the waitress, a comely girl who wore a simple denim
 dress and smelled of Avon's Irish Creme ala Hand Cream. She looked faintly
 French, her lips small and head oval, and she warmed to my glance by
 lightly placing her right breast on my left shoulder.
<p>   "Whadd ya want?", she said in a heavy Brooklyn accent. My illusions were
 squashed, but I recovered quickly.
   <p>"I'll take the Chino stew and pale blue egg soup. Also, can you tell me
 the significance of the Steinberg monument and why some people's visages
 look horrible, and other's normal?"
<p>   "Honey, I ain't here on business babe, i'm only here for fun. Or
 vice-versa, you get my drift. I don't ask questions, and I don't answer
 them. Ask that man over there - the Al Ginsberg look-alike with the pipe
 in his mouth."
   <p>I thanked her and screwed my courage to approach the scraggly-bearded
 man.
<p>   "Sir, my name is Moon River, and I was wondering what the deal about the
 steinberg mirror is."  I had made up the name Moon River after havingread
 how these 60's survivors love strange & wacky drug-induced naming
 conventions.
<p>   "Well Moon, if I may call you that," he said.
   <p>"Call me Moon, or even Ol' man River - doesn't matter to me!" I said.
<p>   He ignored the joke.
   <p>"Steinbergs...ahh...son you got a lot to learn. You know you're a
 steinberg if-" AND THAT'S WHEN WE LOST TRANSMISSION!!
<hr>
   I came to my senses about 15 seconds later. I was dazed. Caught up in a
 vortex of confusion. Never before had I blacked out so completely - not
 even that time with Clarissa on my Uncle Jim's farm in Piddle, OH.
 Something was happening to me, and I was convinced that it had to do with
 this Steinbergian quest of mine. I mean, what else could it be - surely
 not the stew or blue egg soup that I had just forced down the hatch. The
 Al Ginsber look-alike was still talking, "...and the talk just won't die
 down. I reckon if someone was to get an itch in their heel they could get
 to the bottom of this Steinberg business. Like I was just saying...a
 steinberg is known by his sense of mystery, and you got more mystery
 around you than a dog has fleas. Why just a minute ago, your eyes glazed
 over and I wasn't sure if any of this was getting thru to you or not."
<p>   He leaned in my direction. I detected the scent of his Old Spice as he
 whispered, "Seriously, son, you'd be best to be careful. I seen alot a
 fellas like yourself come through this town, and I wonder what happens to
 them all.  They either go back to where they came from or, as some like to
 think, maybe they really do get swallowed up in their dream. I, for one,
 wish that confounded monument wasn't here at all. It may be  bringin' in
 some business, but it's bringin' in more bad than good - and that's for
 damn sure! They ain't been able to explain the recent disappearances in
 these parts, and I think it's due to the mirror rock out there."
<p>   "What do you mean by 'disappearances'?, I asked, "I haven't heard
 anything about stuff like that."
<p>   "And your probably the only one within a cow fart that hasn't...over the
 past 6 months there hve been nearly 50 missing persons reported in a 100
 mole radius around Leb'nun (that's how natives say it), and none of 'em
 has as much as showed a tooth around here. I think it's because of the
 monument 'cause it's only been here for a couple of years, and I think
 that there is something really strange about that rock. One feller told me
 he saw a steinbergian woman slowly fade away behind or into the monument -
 he couldn't tell me which it was. Now that's wierd sh-t! If you'll pardon
 me saying so...you ain't religious are ya'?" I lied and nodded the
 negative sign. "Sev'ral of your type that I met seem to be 'specially
 pious, and I got no cause to offend."
 <p>  I wasn't really listening to him. I was looking outside the diner. There
 on the sidewalk was the curious young woman that had travelled next to me
 on the bus. She was looking down at a map and then up at the sky toward
 where hte son was setting. Then she reached into her jeans and pulled out
 a piece of Bazooka bubble gum. She held the map under her arm while she
 separated the gum from the wrapper and I found myself admiring her
 suddenly. I hadn't really noticed her before on the bus, the crossword
 puzzle and my own thoughts preoccupied me on the way over here. But I do
 remember glancing once at her sleeping form, and realizing in a distant
 sense that she was an attractive woman. I remembered how soft her brown
 hair looked as it fell across her face and the one lock of hair that was
 strewn through the growing pool of drool on my leg.
 <p>  "Thanks, Al, for the advice." I interrupted. I threw a five and a one on
 the table and went outside. "You watch yourself!" he yelled behind me.
 <p>  Once outside, I quickly noticed the quaintness and charm surrounding
 this part of Lebanon. The rainy overcast look had abated to the east, and
 there was the quiet sun setting, on its way to the other side of the
 planet. I walked around the corner of the cafe, and went over to where the
 brown-haired slobber-sleeper was standing a few seconds earlier. She had
 started on down the street so I observed her as I followed. As I got
 closer, I settled it in my mind that she was one fine specimen of a woman.
 She was wearing an old pair of jeans that weren't too tight or too loose -
 the kind that take a year or two to break in that well. She was obviously
 looking for something from her map so she was completely unconscious of
 me. Not that she was ever that self-conscious probably. Anyone that can
 fall asleep on a strangers lap, and THEN drool all over them can't be
 self-conscious. The more I thought about it the more I liked that thought.
 <p>  There is nothing that I enjoy more than watching an attractive lady when
 she doesn't think she is being observed. She sauntered along, and I
 noticed that she had a natural grace to her movements that added to the
 well-formed shape that God had bequeathed upon her. As I caught up to her,
 I breathed a quick "excuse me" and watched her turned around to face me. I
 will not forget the look that I saw in her eyes!
 <hr>  The look was a look of desire of course, for any other look would've
 receded into my memory like sediment beneath a river. It was a look of
 familiarity too, for no woman falls in love at first sight, at least not
 with the kind of fervor this chestnut-haired woman did.
<p>   "Do I know you? I mean, I know I sat next to you on the bus, but I did
 not wake you because you looked so peaceful," I said.
 <p>  "Yes, I do know you. Or at least I know what type of person you are.
 I've lived in Leb'n for some time now, and good people glow on the
 outskirts of town, only to become monster-like as they near the Monument."
 <p>  "OH! I was wondering why reflections in the mirror near the Monument
 were sometimes terrifying."
 <p>  "You best not go near the monument again," she said, "because people
 seem to be disappearing. Come with me to my apartment and I'll show you
 the research I've been doing on it."
 <p>  I followed her like a dog follows its master - adoringly, obediently and
 with tongue residing outside of mouth. Her beauty had grown on me from the
 time her saliva graced my trousers. Her mouth had lain so engagingly on my
 thigh, and I had to suppress thoughts of adjusting its position higher.
 <p>  Her apartment, like her clothing, had a homey,lived-in look and I could
 appreciate the horse theme. There was a horse quilt, a photo of herself at
 the QuarterHorse Congress, a picture of her in chaps at a rodeo and a
 mural of a Kentucky horse farm.
  <p> "Nice horse stuff. I like 'em but I don't ride unfortunately" I said.
 <p>  She merely nuzzled against me. It felt easy and right, like a horse and
 a rider in rhythm.
 <p>  "Well, so, where's that research!?" I asked, a bit nervous.
 <p>  She brought over a Nike Shoe box and showed me faded newspaper
 clippings, photos and a few religious icons.
 <p>  "We've had twenty documented disappearances. They disappear within a
 radius of 20 yards of the monument and the only things that don't
 disappear with the person is any religious artifact that he or she may
 have on them. That's why I have the St. Christopher medal, rosaries and
 pocket bibles here. It seems the thing they have in common is a religious
 faith, notably Catholic. Also the women tend to outnumber the men by 5 to
 1. Looks like women are better people after all!"
 <p>  "Ha, must be a fluke. Not a large enough sample" I said.
 <p>  She was so beautiful now, being in town but not near the monument, that
 it was as if she had a halo. Her face was just inches from my own, and it
 was the most natural event in the world for our lips to touch - barely
 touch. We moved them slightly against the others' cushiony softness. Her
 lips were expert at pleasing mine, and soon my mouth fell to her spring
 buds that seemed to watch me like sentries perched over the valley created
 by her breasts. Her soft breath came into my ear while my lips roamed the
 crests of her chest, and she uttered faint whisperings as I fell into a
 milky reverie brought upon by her opulent skin.
 <p>  I unknowingly mouthed the word 'steinbergs' and then I came back to my
 senses. Well, sort of. The beautiful mysterious stranger was still
 whispering softly and it did not take me long to figure out that it was
 not entirely (if at all) due to my kisses. I held still for a moment and
 listened to see if I could make out any words. She said what sounded like:
 "...in time the human race...beyond mere matter...Cheerios and apple
 pie...wither and fall...I like the...wither and fall...sprite in you...
 fall...". Gently, I laid her down on an old couch and touched her lightly
 on the cheek to bring her back from wherever it was she had gone. She
 looked quite exquisite there in the semi-dark, and I could not keep myself
 from briefly noticing the obvious effects of my former caresses. For she
 was bra-less under her V-neck shirt. I was going to call to her, but I
 realized then that I still did not know her name. So I bent over her and
 nudged her a little more forcefully. All of a sudden, the glazed look left
 her eyes and she smiled at the unabashed concern on my face.
  <p>  "Sir, you ought to patent that kiss of yours. I feel more relaxed than
 I have in several days," she explained quietly.
  <p>  "Are you alright? I mean, what happened to you. I was worried. And, by
 the way, what is your name?" I asked.
<p>    "Oh Johnny," she exclaimed, "you saved me from flying couch stuffings!
 How brave of you to put yourself in the line of fire and take all those
 feathers in the gut!"
   <p>  "Ha ha.  How can you joke about something like this?  What the
 heckledeesyburgerillaters exploded?"
<p>     "heckle what?"
   <p>  "oh, heckledeesyburgerillaters - it was a saying we had as a kid.  In-
 stead of just saying heck.  Guess you had to be there!  I must've flashed
 back to my childhood while watching my life flash before my eyes.  We were
 silly kids; we used to chant the name of a local car dealer, 'Woody Sander
 Ford!' for no good reason at all.  We'd chant the name of any place of
 business along our bus route, and 'Woody Sander Ford' was the one that
 stuck.  To this day I still smile when i hear the word 'woody'.
<p>     She looked at me with her voluminous eyes and said seductively, "i
 smile when i hear the word 'woody' too, big boy."  I gently lifted her
 up from a spent pile of couch stuffings, and we examined the bullet holes
 near the window.
   <p>  "Who wants us dead?" I asked 'Gina.
<p>     "Well I'd say somebody knows that we know something.  Or maybe they just
 don't like the cut of our gib!"
 <p>    "You make me laugh Gina, and that's rare for a woman.  Your sense of
 humor is really wonderful."
   <p>  "Well Tom, er, I mean Johnny, the way you say 'woody' turns me on."
 <p>     We talked to our apartment neighbors to see if they'd seen anything.
 They all seemed strange, as if in a trance.  One neighbor, Hank Ketchup
 said he "ain't seen a thing" but did offer a bottle of Heines' finest.
 I said I never do the stuff before noon.
 <p>     We called the police, although Gina seemed reluctant at first.
 The police sent out a man who really didn't look like an officer - the uniform
 was right, but the way his eyes blinked it looked eerie - like a robot or
 something.

<hr>
<h3>11/17/93</h3>
      He surveyed the damage, the glass of the doomed chandelier crink-
 ling under his foot, and pulled out a notepad and began to write some-
 thing down. Regina walked over to the window on the front wall which had
 borne the brunt of the bullets onslaught, and looked out into the night.
 The air was clear and cool now. The escaping warm air of the house and
 the incoming cooler air stirred up a little breeze that was softly blow-
 ing the hair from her face. I was impressed by her calm and collected
 manner - she was definitely a low maintenance woman.
 <p>     The officer said, "You two are very lucky," he said while squatting
 down to look at something embedded in the far wall of the room, "...to
 still be alive." I felt like I was listening to cassette recording of a
 Matlock show. The officer spoke as if he were reciting a script.
  <p>    He picked up something that looked like a small electronic beeper
 device and lazily slipped it in his pocket.
   <p>   "What is THAT? - that thing you just put in your pocket?," I asked.
 Regina whirled around and the cop just looked at me dumbly.
  <p>    "Uh...I don't know, but we'll check it out downtown and let you
 know what we find out," he returned.
   <p>   "Can I see it please?" I put my hand out. Regina came over quickly
 and grabbed my arm with one hand and put the other on my face, "Johnny,
 let's just leave and let this man do his job. I'm sure he'll check into
 everything that needs checking into..."
  <p>   The man had backed away from me when I held out my hand, and now he
 just stood there watching Regina and me. I was beginning to get an ugly
 feeling in the pit of my stomach - I always felt this way after eating a
 Big Mac. I began to think that this man was an imposter, but I needed to
 find out for sure. I most certainly did not want to leave there without
 getting some questions answered.
 <p>   I thought of offering him a donut. No policeman ever turns down a
 free donut - especially ones that are creme-filled. The absurdity of
 that passing thought brought me back to the present.
  <p>  "Officer, either let me see what you put in your pocket," so much for
 subtlety, "or I'm gonna report your badge number..."
  <p>  "Johnny, let's get out of here!" It was Regina trying to pull me to-
 wards the door.
  <p>  I looked at her, "Are you crazy! Doesn't this whole thing seem a
 little bizarre to you?" I wasn't even bothering to be subtle anymore.
 She just looked at me with that pretty I-don't-get-it face.
 <p>  She pulled me close and whispered, "Come on, I need to talk with you.
 I'm gonna tell you something that will be difficult for both of us to
 take...Outside, not here."
<hr>
<h3>11/23/93</h3>
     Gina took my hand and caressed it as if she were trying to calm
 an unruly pet.  She led me outside and held her hand over my mouth.
 It smelled of Herbal Essence of Ching-A-Ling Dong, a moisturizer I
 remember from my days with Sang Yon Lee when I was in 'Nam slinging
 hash.  She then removed her hand and quickly replaced it with her
 lips - they were warm and wet and animated.  In the background the
 doors of Gina's apartment closed and unclosed noisily.
  <p>  "Don't speak unless it's a whisper. okay?"
<p>    "Okay," i whispered.
   <p> "Johnny I don't know how to say this but...but I will anyway.  Look,
 I'm in on it.  I'm supposed to get you to the Monument but because
 I'm falling for you I'm now targeted along with you by them-"
<p>    "Who is 'them'?" i said.
   <p> "They are militia from the Republic of Sudan.  They are
 working covertly for the Chinese government, but it's not what you
 think.  The purposes are noble believe it or not.  We are trying
 to free the Steinberg's from-".  Just then a flash came from nowhere
 and the heat from a huge blast fell upon us.  I grabbed Gina and
 we ran - ran like the wind until we were very far away and the cinders
 of what was left of her apartment began to cool.
<hr>
<h3> 11/24/93</h3>
    "Do you think he's o.k.?" I gasped for air while asking that quest-
 ion even though I really didn't care about the fate of the unfortunate
 officer at all.
 <p>   We were on the edge of a ridge with sparse trees here and there.
 There was some bedrock breaking out of the rough grass, and Gina was
 half-reclining on the grass with her back leaning back against a small
 rock formation. Looking back from where we had run, I realized that we
 were about a 1/4 mile from her apartment. The rising smoke was making
 the midnight sky even darker in that direction. From our slightly higher
 vantage point, I could see clearly the lights from the fire engine and
 the rescue squad that had been called there by somebody. The revolving
 lights from the vehicles cast a eerie glow into the smoky sky and I was
 a kid just for a moment taking it all in.
 <p>   In my best John Wayne voice I said, "Well, little lady, we'd best be
 gettin' on before they pick up our trail. Do you think we should go to
 the monument or just get outta Leb'nun?"
  <p>  "That's not a good idea - the monument, I mean. We are obviously in
 danger..."
  <p>  "But you said that you were part of a noble cause or something like
 that - why would they want to hurt us?"
 <p>  She looked up at me while I watched her delicate hand pull a clump of
 grass out of the ground, "I don't know what to think right now - I'm
 beginning to think that I've been misled for evil purposes." She dropped
 the clump of grass on my shoe, and then unconsciously pulled up more un-
 witting blades by the roots.
  <p>  "You said something about freeing the Steinbergs...what was the pur-
 pose that they presented to you to convince you to help them?"
 <p>  She was now on her tenth clump of grass and I couldn't see my shoes
 anymore as she brushed her hair out of her face and put it behind her
 ear.
  <p>  "Basically, they told me that these steinbergian people had a chem-
 ical imbalance that prohibited them from enjoying life properly. There
 was a sense of angst, in almost every case that they had researched,
 that kept steinbergs from just accepting life as it was. This angst or
 sense of the tragic was preventing them from being efficient, happy,
 and shiny people. You know, the type of people who go to malls and spend
 ungodly amounts of money on frivolous things - people who make them-
 selves busy, who crank their music loud, who believe in the axiom
 'discuss everything but religion and politics', who sit on their couches
 and let Matlock influence their lifes decisions, and...
  <p>  "Gina, I get the idea..."
  <p>  "The steinberg types question things; they question authority. They
 are the ones that do not blindly accept the so-called axioms of life.
 Some have weird haircuts, they read and comprehend cummings and poe,
 they buy a house and look forward to making it a home complete with a
 library, they tend to enjoy nature and doing belly-flops down wet,grassy
 hillsides, they..."
  <p>   I had leaned over and kissed her to get her to stop talking, not
 because I wasn't interested in what she had to say, but because she was
 suddenly irresistible to me in the soft light of night.
  <p>   Then I grabbed a handful of grass and stuffed it down the front of
 her shirt while dropping another handful on her head. She laughed and
 said I was "in trouble, buster" while putting her hand around my neck
 trying to get me in a headlock. She had a serious grip and she was pull-
 ing me on top of her, but I couldn't turn around and face her such was
 her grip on my neck. We were both laughing totally unaware of our sur-
 roundings caught up in the pleasure of each others company. I leaned
 forward onto my knees as she still clung to my neck from behind. She was
 on top of me, gleefully grunting in my ear, "I got ya now. Whaddaya
 gonna do about that?"
  <p>   I got one hand free, and reached down and squeezed her thigh just
 below her perfect behind, and just as I thought she was ticklish there.
 She loosened her grip a little so I quickly flung her underneath me and
 quickly she was pinned. I grinned at her and asked, "What are you gonna
 do now, my little gladiator?" I kissed her softly for a few moments, and
 neither one of us noticed the shadows that gathered all around us.<hr>
<h3>11/29/93</h3>
      It was the Raisinettes that fell from one of the shadows' pockets
 that alerted me to their presence.  Gina's eyes were half-closed in
 feigned orgasmic pleasure, but I noticed the burly guy with the belly
 the size of Manhattan because I'd been to the movies recently and
 recognized the sound of falling Raisinettes.
<p>     "Quick get them!" he yelled, while picking up loose
 Raisinettes off the ground and putting them into his enormous mouth.
   <p>  I had unpinned Gina and helped her to her feet but they trapped us;
 we were surrounded us on all sides.
<p>     "What do you want?" Gina asked plaintively.
   <p>  "Ahh my little chickadee," said the fat one, "i'd like merely to
 have the pleasure of your company."
<p>     "Calgon take me away," Gina whispered in my ear.
   <p>  "What'd you say??" the big guy said.
<p>     "I said, 'salmon let's go play!'."
   <p>  "oh," he said dumbly.
<p>     He stuffed a big ugly cigar in his mouth and then took it out and
 swirled it in Gina's face.  He made her take a puff before I took
 action.
   <p>  "Stop it right now!  Gina don't smoke!" I said.
<p>     "whatz dis look like? damn non-smoking section of a restaurant?
 Fella's - tie him up."
   <p>  At once the other three silent partners pushed me down and roped
 my wrists.  I felt like cattle at a Fort Worth ropin' contest.  But
 Gina had something besides handlebar-smooth wrists up her sleeve -
 she had a trick.  She'd hit a homing device that was taped delicately
 to her upper thigh.  Soon the Sudanese would come to our rescue, or
 come to our demise - either way our only hope was to make something
 happen.  Meanwhile we were forced to wait while Gina suffered in
 silence to the taunts and untoward suggestions of our kidnapper.
<p>    "So my little chickadee, you're in quite a mess.  Perhaps you
 should say your prayers." he chuckled.
   <p> "Sir you are the one in need of prayers.  Why are you doing this?
 Were you born evil or were you always this way?", Gina said, obviously
 flustered.
<p>    "Chickadee,I'm a regular church-agoer. Yep been there twice and plan
 on a 3rd time - first to get hatched, second to get matched, and last
