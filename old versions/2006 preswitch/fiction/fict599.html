<h3>Marie d'Antoinette begins a Horror novel 05/27/99</h3>

Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?<p>
  It wasn't even her fault.  After all, was it her fault that she was beautiful?  That all the
guys on the team wanted her?
Oh, if only she hadn't gone into the locker room that day.  If only she had remembered
her panties.  If only they hadn't all lined up and . . .
But, none of those things had happened.  She had gone in, without her panties, and
faced that line of boys.  They all had their pleasure.  Sure, it felt good at the start but
then she remembered her solemn vow to her mother, "I shall never pleasure a man
without first having performed the Sacred Ritual first."
<p>
Now, here she was, huddling under the bleachers.  She wiped her hands on the grass
to get the sticky mess off them.  All those big strong men against just her.  She knew
her spell over them must have been strong.  Her mind drifted back as she remembered
each one of them and how it felt as she had done it.  How each of them had dripped
and spurted.
Yes, she would certainly be kicked off the team now because there was no team.  Only
a mass of bodies with their heads snuggled in their arms just the way they had carried
the football only hours before.
<p>
Mama would certainly be angry for Beverly had not performed the consecration rites
over the knife before hacking off their heads.  She tried to decide which thing to tell
Mama first:  the cheerleading squad, or the team?

<h3><a href=mailto:chrisyoung@cslsheffapps.demon.co.uk>Chris de la Plume</a>
begins a Romantic Political SF Mystery novel 05/20/99</h3>

Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside
her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...
  <p>
As she watched him, Vladimir seemed to fade. His handsome Slavonic profile 
seemed to become indistinct and his fine manly shoulders shrank away
before her horrified gaze, leaving nothing but the impression in the 
sheets where he had lain as a mocking farewell.
  <p>
Monique sat frozen with terror, as questions chased one another through
her mind.  What had she done? What dreadful monster was even now
growing within her? Why had a ship called the Pacific Princess taken her
to the coast of Dalmatia? How would she explain all this to the Duke when she
eventually met him?
  <p>
Slipping into her clothes she hurried out into the sultry Dubrovnik dawn.
What a fool she had been! Was it the wine which had let her believe 
Vladimir when he told her he was the owner of the Palace of Diocletian?
She looked back at the mean little house she had just escaped. To think
she had persuaded herself that *this* was an imperial mansion! Oh the
folly of passion!
  <p>
"Exscuse me miss."  Monique turned at the sound of the quiet New England
tones. Teddy Kennedy! But what did it mean?
  <p>
Was she saved, or was this some new adventure...

<h3><a href=mailto:rodneyd@minot.com>Mijnheer</a> begins a  novel
05/12/99</h3>
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.<p>
  The wrinkled green skin and wet leather smell made my nose ache.  The alligator
wasn't that great either.  I asked her where she found it.<p>
"My husband collects them"<p>
She breathed a mangled cocktail of gin and cheap cigarettes.  My hunch told me this
broad's husband was dead or missing.  Or both.  She continued.
"Some men came looking for my husband soon after he returned from his trip to South
America.  I think this is what they were after".<p>
"Lady, I have a hard time believing some thugs are showing interest in this deformed
tree frog.  I'd throw you out on your cute little can, except your stocking tops are
showing through that slit in your skirt and it's peaked my interest.  Now tell me another
bedtime story, and make it interesting enough so's I don't feel the need to belt you and
send you on your way.  My time is precious."<p>
"Yes, I can tell by your seedy office and slept-in wardrobe that my business is not
needed.  You must be raking in clients."<p>
I stood up, grabbed her wrist and sent her sprawling all over the dusty couch in my
office.  I then loomed over her, ready to smack the taste out of her fresh mouth when
her eyes opened wide in horror.  I felt good putting the fear of God into her, but when I
felt the butt of a pistol crack the back of my skull open, I realized it wasn't me she was
afraid of.  I caught the beginning of her scream as I hit the floor and blacked out.   
<p>

<h3>Robert Williams continues <a href=novels/rosalind.html>Rosalinda's Rising Passions</a> 5/2</h3>
As for Harriman himself , well suffice it to say that he, having spent some 
two score years as the unwilling and (so his captors thought) dimwitted guest 
of a small but(or so he assumed, though in fact he had not actually been 
privy to anything , shall we say, unnatural) ruthless tribe of savages whose 
name he could never pronounce, their limited vocabulary consisting, as far as 
he could tell, of a few rather unpleasant sounds accompanied from time to 
time by the slapping of ones buttocks and (though he was not absolutely sure, 
even after all those many years, of its grammatical significance ( he could 
only assume, as one inevitably followed close upon the other)) by the emitting 
of, how shall we say, a particularly foul smelling gas which made his 
captivity nearly unendurable , so how unfortunate then that upon his arrival 
at his true-loves door his first response should be , not a lovers heart-felt 
sentiments, but a loud and quite unexpected gaseous outburst.
