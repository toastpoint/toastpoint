<H3>Elisabeth Marten begins a History novel 12/26/97</H3>It was an unusually 
quiet day on the executioner's block. Anticipation loomed over everyone like a 
heavy fog. Normally, dozens of people were awaiting their deaths, but on July 
28, 1794, they were free. Only one man awaited his destiny. That man, ironically 
enough, was Maximillien Francois Marie Isidore de Robespierre. The same man who 
had led the French Revolution through its Reign of Terrror. The same man who had 
sentenced hundreds of the so-called "traitors" to death. Now they had grown 
tired of all the senseless killing, and he was to die by by the same device of 
fate which he had condemned so many others to. The crowd in the square slowly 
grew more and more anxious as the morning wore on. They grew restless, demanding 
the termination of Robespierre. Finally, when the sun had finished its ascent, 
the black-hooded executioner stepped out onto the platform in the center of 
town. Two soldiers led Robespierre to his impending doom. As he walked towards 
the stage, his life passed before his eyes. He remembered how when he was born, 
no one expected a commoner like hisself to ever achieve anything. He proved them 
wrong by leading the National Assembly and the Jacobins. He adored the power, 
and killed anyone who would even think of trying to take it away from him. His 
popularity fell as the death toll rose, and the citizens grew to despise him. He 
collapsed under the pressure and had even tried to take his life the night 
before. He injured his jaw with a musket, but failed in committing suicide. The 
moment the gun went off, soldiers stormed into his house and ruined his aim. 
They wrapped his head in a handkerchief and threw him into prison, where he 
remained until dawn. A hood was placed over his head, and he knelt down. He 
whispered a small prayer as the wooden beam locked his head into place, and with 
one final flash of silver, his life came to a suitable ending.

<H3>Rat Boy begins a Coming of Age novel 12/21/97</H3>I got a woman that's down 
with me, because she I got a dick that hangs like a willow tree. But the only 
difference between me and that tree is as long as I got this here dick she ain't 
gonna ever leave. I had a woman with big ole teets, and at night when I made 
love to her she wanted me to wear my golf cleets. I said look here woman, 
wearing these cleets I ain't no damn good. She said I know but when you hit this 
hole in one you me remind me of Tiger Woods.

<H3><A href="mailto:bussdevsupp.brann.bristol.co.uk">Leech Crich</A> begins a 
Virginia Andrews Novel 12/16/97</H3><IMG alt="Gold Star!" 
src="fict1297_files/star3.gif" align=right> Green was the green grass that i lay 
on and green was the colour of the grass on the grave of my mother and my 
mother's sister and my mother's aunt. always the colour green brought bad 
tidings in the house of my father, Manx Lynx, deep in the lush and verdant 
forest of Western Virginia, where we lived far away from the marauding eyes of 
the village. My father was a tall man, broad of face and friendly of visage. He 
was the brown of the solid tree-bark, while my mother was the yellow-blonde of 
the sunflower. And my grandmother was grey, grey like a horse that is called 
grey but is white, and all of them were dead, dead, dead in the green ground. 
But I was alive that fateful day when they brought the remaining members of my 
incredibly large family to Wolverine House. Though I had thought that my mother 
Cordite and my father Manx and my grandmother Bismol were the only living 
relations of I, Corney, it turned out I was wrong...and black was that day, 
black like the stem of an eggplant. Black like the hair of my half-brother Cob, 
whose eyes I can still see, whenever I think about the times that, inevitably, 
we had incestuous sex. We were evil seeds of the wrong plant, a plant whose 
seeds should never have been taken out of the packet and scattered as if by the 
hands of careless children who had never yet experienced the strangeness of 
incestuous sex. Woe upon us that day we met, for we knew what our fate would be. 
Fate was written on our shameful foreheads, on our deceptively smooth skins, 
that sinfully longed to touch and caress and indulge in evil, shameful 
practices. From the very beginning, our line was doomed,! doomed to endlessly 
repeat itself for no real reason, even after all of us had died.
