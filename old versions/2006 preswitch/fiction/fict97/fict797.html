<h3><a href=mailto: rmushko@roanoke.infi.net>Wilt Dizzy</a> retells the myth of Narcissus 7/1</h3>
Once upon a time, in a faraway generic land that was filled with remarkably
 talented flora and fauna, there lived an adolescent lad who apparently had a gender identify problem (or maybe not).  Anyhow, his father was concerned that the youth Narcissus (a name which the father  finding too sissy, shortened  to Narcy which wasn't much better) wasn't
 interested in baseball  or wrestling or other guy things, but Narcy's mother--happy that her son was interested in his  appearance and seemed to have good self-esteem, frequently hugged him to her ample  bosom and told him how wonderful and special he was. Narcy was generally oblivious to his  parents, however, preferring to spend long hours staring happily at his reflection in a mirror  (while background music played) or, when his father told him to get out of the house and do  guy stuff, staring equally happily at his reflection in a tastefully landscaped pond (where fish  sang and bankside flowers danced). He was also oblivious to a teenage nymphet of limited  vocabulary (indeed, she could only echo what was said to her) but with really big hooters. This  nymphet (we'll call her Tiffany or Buffy or Muffy) frequently followed him to the pond, where  Narcy often told her to leave him alone and get a life. "Get a life...get a life," the nymphet  mumbled (and perhaps she sang it) to herself repeatedly, but she never did.<p>
Narcy meanwhile  fixated upon his reflection while his faithful pet--a cute little animal of indeterminate  species--named Muffy or Fluffy or Scruffy snoozed on the bank. Indeed, Narcy's reverie was only disturbed by the appearance of the town bully named Spike  or Butch or Biff, an evil character of low self-esteem whose appearance was flawed by a zit on  his nose or really bad hair or perhaps a hunchback (well, maybe not that last one--that's a  good-guy trait) who would call poor Narcy such politically incorrect names (that Tiffany or Buffy  or Muffy repeated even though she didn't mean to)  that poor Narcy became quite depressed  and anorexic, which caused his mother to worry and his father to say, "I told you so!" At this point, a famous jeans designer (whom we'll call Calvin or Ralph or Jordache,  depending upon pending negotiations) who decided to use the pond as background for his  next ad campaign ("We'll wet our pants for you!") spotted the gaunt youth lounging upon the  bank and offered him a million dollar modeling contract. Suddenly lured away from gazing at his reflection by the promise of cash (Note: the teenage  audience can identify with this!), Narcy exclaimed, "A million dollar contract!" Tiffany or Buffy or Muffy, who had been lurking nearby as usual, also exclaimed, "A million  dollar contract!...a million dollar contract!" with her characteristic upward inflection, so that  Calvin or Ralph or Jordache thought she was part of a package deal and, noticing her obvious  assets, signed her up as a lingerie model. All this made Spike or Butch or Biff so angry (note how crowded it was around this secluded  pond) that he fell into the pond and would have drowned had it not been for the quick action of  Muffy or Fluffy or Scruffy who leapt in and pulled him out. So touched was Spike or Butch or  Biff by the unselfish act of kindness that the generic little animal performed to someone who  had in the past chucked rocks at it, that he reformed on the spot--just in time for the big song  and dance number that featured all the humans, animals, fish, flowers, and trees. Indeed, the  flowers did such a great job that Narcy decreed as the closing credits rolled that they could be named after him without having to pay him any royalty whatsoever for use of his name.

Of course, everyone lived happily ever after. I mean, what did you expect?
