<h3><a href=mailto:cdeisel@aol.com>Carm Monte</a> begins a Romance novel 12/29/98</h3>
The day before I met Jodi it rained. Truthfully I fail to remember anything before I met her, but I know it had to rain. I know
because the moment I saw her it was like everything else in the world had just been washed away. The world was now new. I
had never approached a stranger on the street before, I mean this is New York, even the sweetest little women is probably
carrying a gun, or at least some mace. Well all that aside I still walked right up to her and said.... nothing, I tripped on her
poodle, fell on my face and gave myself a bloody nose. I then heard her angel voice ask me if I was Okay, although I heard it
from about half a block away as I was sprinting home. <p>
Ya know now that I look back on it I think to myself isnt that what happens in all relationships. Yep I feel pretty good about
the whole thing.....

A wisp of her hair caught his cheek as he secretly enjoyed his breakfast. The wonderful bounty of her bosom implied
something, he was  not sure what. "Oh God", Tara thought, "I'm very rich and very bored", as she studied her prettified toenails.
"Ricky," she said, morosely, "get me my goddamn shampoo." Ricky jumped up and ran out of the room, cornflakes clinging to
his befuddled lips like his ears clung to his head. 
<p>
Tara stretched and yawned, the springtime air wafting into the smartly
ventilated kitchen, arousing many delights under the noses of her sexy and swarthy male servants. "Ricky is gone  now servants"
Tara meowed and climbed up onto the table, her endlessly expensive negligee rising up her narrowly short-changed thighs, "It is
time, slabs of pleasure." She curled up near the breakfast bowl and played a naughty game with a milky spoon, "Ricardo,
Eguardo, come forward, Perverda, up against the wall." The boredom of the previous nights with Ricky scrolled through her head, Ricky humming under the covers, Ricky fumbling through her plastic, Ricky rising
without little Ricky, Ricky wrinkling before her eyes and she looked to Ricardo and wrapped her legs with an ecstatic rush of
breath. It was time for love, love with servants, love with all abandon, love with incoherent pleas for misplaced pleasure, love
with freely jetting fluids, love with bad joints, love with one foot too many, love, love, without breakfast.

It had been fifty years since he had been in the resistance. But this 
was a time of joyous celebration. His fiftieth anniversary, married to his 
one and only love. Still, no one knew of the dark secret he had been forced 
to keep, fifty years this day.

Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.  That cold and bitter night it came. 
He could feel its presence. It had an odour that engulfed
the entire chamber.

"I have walked this earth for thousands of years, remaining mostly inconspicous.  I am known to all, yet when seen, go
unrecognized.  I watch you, yearning for what you have, wanting with all my being to be anything other than what I am.  I take
many forms. I was the young lady poured your ale last night, and the old hag who cured you in the morn.  I am here to do my
job, that which I was born to do. Most shall not see me in my true form, until it is too late.  But you.  You are different. You
saw me before your time, and now I must fortell what your destiny is.  You have been chosen to take my place.  Still you ask,
who am I?  I thought it was obvious for my young replacement who I am.  Yet I will tell you. I am Death."

<h3><a href=mailto:dlong@nxs.net>Daniel Wayne Gibson</a> begins a Romance novel 12/17/98</h3>
"But really, Bartholomew" laughed Lady Zinnia with her characteristic 
throaty chuckle, "You can't be serious!  Lady Thanninger, with that 
dashing young... oh, no, it can't be.  He's simply too <em>common</em> 
for someone of her station!"<p>
  Bartholomew smiled, "Lady Zinnia, it is the truth!  Lady Thanninger confided in me just last night.  Listen dear, she told me
that she was tired of all those pompous, old goats that were all talk and no action. <p>
 Lady Zinnia sat up in her bed so she could
hear every word.  "Tell me more Bartholomew!"  Sitting down on the side of the bed, Bartholomew continued, "Well, she said
the young, handsome man suited her needs quiet well. Her dashing, young man with his dark, curly hair and hard, bronze body,
and his massive, throbbing man-hood left her completely satisfied!  She could care less what those stuffy, sexless creatures that
pretended to be her devoted friends thought."  Lady Zinnia swooned back on her pillows, "Bartholomew, what was your
response?"  Bartholomew laughed, "I told her after hearing this that I was sorely jealous, and that I only had men like that in my
dreams!"  Lady Zinnia patted his hand, "Now, now, you would not even look at someone so common."  <p>With a twinkle in his eyes, Bartholomew stated, "I will tell you what Lady Thanninger said on the subject.  She said that once you were
under the sheets naked, that the word common never entered into your thoughts!"

<h3><a href=mailto:>ST. Jude</a> begins a spooky novel 12/17/98</h3>
What is to say what makes a man good or evil. Why one man would choose to
kill and the other choose to protect. Some would say this is the way of society, That we create the monsters that terrorize our
dreams. I know this to be a lie. <p>
 It was the winter of 79, and I had taken a night job at the morgue to help send myself through college. It was not a glamorous
job, but injoyed it just the same. I was working alone on the night that the monster was brought to my attention. Sitting behind
my desk as I always did. I was lost in one of my many books, perhaps it was a mystery maybe even a tale of horror I do not
truly recall.<p>
 The doors opened abruptly, sending a chill of winter air into the room. It was a paramedic, he was pushing in a gurney with a
clipboard set on top of the covered man. The man smiled as he looked at me "This one took a leap out of a seventh story
window, must not like holidays." It was a poor chose for a joke, but I guess when you see death as much as him it was one of
the ways of coping with the stress.<p>
 "Does he have a name?" I asked as I got up from my chair and walked to him.<p>
 "No couldn't find a wallet or any form of I.D. but we do have a backpack full of stuff for you to go through." he handed me the
pack and I set it down next to the gurney. Then he handed me the clipboard. "Just sign hear and he is all yours." I signed the
paper and handed it back to him.<p>
 He helped me transfer the man to an emty bed, and then he was gone I suppose that I should have said more to the man, but I
was still fairly new to the job and the sight of death still stunned me.<p>
 Now I have said that I worked in the morgue but I was not the coroner or anything like that. Infact I knew very little about the
homan body. It was my job to clean the bodys that came in at night so that the coroners could go strait to work in the morning.
The first step in this was to cut of all of the blood soked clothes and place them in plastic bags marked with the man's name and
the date he was brought in. Then came the appalling task of cleaning the man. I hated this part of the job, I thought for a second
about putting this off and going back to my book. I dismissed this thought almost as fast as it had intered my mind. Not because
it was necessarily a bad idea, but for all you that had tried to clean dry blood away from a wound you know that it is not an
easy task.<p>
 The man was a mess of blood and gashes, I thought to myself that some of the wounds looke stange for a man that jumped
from a window. But as I said I knew very little about the human body. The man's head was crushed I could hardly even make
out what use to be the man's face. Fragments of the man's brain were seeping out onto the cold steel table. His chest was
ripped open and his heart was missing. These were the most noticeable injuries, although almost all his bones seemed to be
broke. There didn't seem to be one uninjured spot on the man's body. And the blood, how it covered him, I feared that I would
never finish the job of cleaning him. And in the end it took me over two hours to do the job.

<h3>Lamban von Eap begins a Mystery novel 12/16/98</h3>
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.  
  Especially when you used Bologna Stick cologne liberally, like I like to do.

  You also take out your trusty water pistol from your desk drawer and aim it right between
the wide, dark, liquid eyes of the leggy broad.  Or at least I did, cause you can't be too
careful.  Who knew what other reptilian secrets she hid, maybe under that hat, that suspiciously
wide hat which shaded her face in such an attractive manner I could almost ignore the bristling
eyebrows drawing low over those aforementioned fawnlike pools of molten onyx which she used
for eyes.  She curled her lip at me and lowered her lids, narrowing those eys, and I realized only
then that my water gun had wavered, and she would surely take advantage of that and my confusion
to do something unspeakable.  She reached out and scratched the alligator's head as she purred at me
in a voice like a rattlesnake sliding through yards of wet silk, "I want you to find its mama...it's
worth a lot of greenbacks to me..."  And I could only wonder, staring up into her face, if she meant
the money I was used to, or the turtles my last Friend of Amphibians had paid me in.

when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.<p>
       "It's yours honey", she said, each word dripping out of her mouth.
<p>     Silently, I ran one hand down the scaly back of the alligator.  Why would this woman bring me such a creature?   Right
about then, she gave me a look.   That look told me that it would be better if I didn't ask.
   <p>  "You find my husband, Johnny "Bad Seed" Apple and you can have Veronica."  
<p>     If Veronica was the snapping creature sprawled across my desk, I didn't want her.  Now, on the other hand, if Veronica
was Gia's sister, maybe I would sit up and take notice.
   <p>  "Baby, how does that sound?  Want this nice man to find daddy for us?"
<p>     I was right.  Veronica was the baby alligator.  
   <p> "It does say outside that payment is negotiable", her voice caressing me like a velvet sky.  She leaned closer to my desk and
I thought she was going to kiss me.  Instead, she ran one finger down Veronica's back and rose gracefully from her chair.  As
she sauntered out of the office, I heard six chairs hit the ground and twelve pairs of feet slam.  Every pair of eyes in the place
was watching Gia as she turned one last time and whispered my last instructions.
<p>     "Please find him.  I am counting on you."
   <p>  I knew right then and there, I would have to not only find "Bad Seed" but that I now had a pet alligator.
<p>     Two weeks later, I had found Johnny.  I also had a new pair of alligator shoes and a belt.  As for Gia Gondola, I never saw
her again.  When I found Johnny, we spoke on the phone.  I knew in my heart that boat had sailed forever.

<h3><a href=mailto:Dulcnea143@aol.com>Daria Storm</a> begins a Romance novel 12/12/98</h3>
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...  
  She wiggled free of his barbaric arms and slipped out of the bed. Quietly Monique retrieved her secret box from under the
grand cherry oak bed frame. She scurried to the bathroom, locking herself in. Turning on the tub water to appear that she was
taking a shower, she sat on the cold, hard floor. Opening her box, the only possession she managed to keep from the Duke, a
tear slid down her soft, delicate cheek. It seemed to rush down her face toward the small photograph she held in her palm.
John. She remembered being dragged upon the Pacific Princess by her father, as John rushed toward her only a minute too
late. Monique ached at the thought of his chestnut brown hair blowing in the wind, and his sea green eyes, almost identical to
hers, as he screamed her name. Her father was given a large velvet sack, filled with gold, in place of his only daughter,
Monique. His cold eyes neglected to even glace at her, as she begged his mercy. Suddenly she was aware of a noise. The
Duke. !<p>
Her crying must have awoken him. She quickly stripped off her silk gown and stepped into the cold shower. She shuddered as
the Duke grunted his usual greeting: "Breakfast! Now!" Monique turned off the rancid, cold water, and headed toward the
dark, dreary bedroom. She dressed quickly and began to prepare for the Duke's day. He watched her, drooling, as she made
his  breakfast and groped her every time she walked by. She feared the day she would have a barbarian of his evolving within
her body. John had always wanted to have a boy to call Peter and a girl to call Julia. The dreams they had together, the plans,
will never be forgotten. After she watched him inhale his food, Monique was sent down to do his laundry. As she passed
through the mail room she was suddenly startled by a tall man in a long, dark coat. He handed her a dirty, yellowed envelope
and rushed out the door. Still recovering from the shock, she didn't bother to chase him, or call him back. Her tiny, shaking
fing!
ers tore open the envelope with the word, "Lady" on the front. Inside was a withered piece of torn paper with only a few
words. It was dated July 17.......ten years ago. Monique kept track of every day she had been with the Duke. It was twelve
years now. For she just passed her twenty-eighth birthday. The letter read:<p>
                   Dear Lady,<br>
       I have been asked to deliver you the latest news in your absence. The town is currently planning many funerals. There has
been a war here, and many of our men so graciously sacrificed their lives. Your father was not one. He died in prison this last
month. But your dear John led our troops victoriously through this war. As he lay dying, he begged me to deliver you this letter.
Hopefully I have fulfilled my duty, for you are now reading this. John wanted you to know that you are in his heart forever. You
will be together soon.<br>
                                           Sincerely Yours,<br>
                                                  A friend<p>

As the tears rolled down Monique's cheek, she felt a smile form on her face. They would be together soon. Without a moments
stalling she ran into the courtyard and searched for the largest rock in the garden. She ran twice as fast to the barn and lugged
back the heaviest sturdiest rope.. As she tied these two together and then to her own tiny legs, she never lost her smile. Wading
into the lake she thought to herself, 'Yes, we will be together soon.'

<h3><a href=mailto:matthew@atlantic.net>Samkins H. Opossum</a> continues a
trailer-park-romance-turned-sci-fi-turned-Greek-Comedy novel 12/10/98</h3>
This story is a continuation of a story begun in <a href=fict698.html>June</a> By Remy Trudeau, continued by Samkins H. Opossum, and continued
again by Bork E. Muscovisko.
 <p>
Dramitis Personae:<br>
<i>Tiffani</i> - A trailer-park girl<p>
<i>Billy-Bob</i> - A trailer park/doughnut shop/tanning salon owner with an as-yet undefined relationship to Tif (brother? husband?
both?)<p>
<i>gRTz149f</i> - An alien spaceship pilot<p>
<i>Enos</i> - cousin to Tiffani (and possibly BB)<p>
<i>@@[ctrl+alt+del]@@</i> - General-Priest of the Mfwrtzian Technocracy<p>
<i>Spunky</i> - a dog<p>
<i>Clovis/sIU795pp/iXiX56~</i> - The Chorus, consisting of an altered Earthling dullard, a plucky young ship-repair tech, and a
Mfwrtz graduate with the soul of a painter
<p>
<b>The Story So Far:  </b>
<i>Act I</i> -- Wherein We Meet Everyman, a Trailer, and a Cheeze-Wiz Comestable<p>
Fired from her job at Piggly Wiggly (for tokin' in the meat department), Tiffani danced a slow dance of sorrow to Puff-Daddy.  
Billi-Bob called for her assistance in the kitchen.
<p>
<i>Act II</I> -- Wherein Lies a Taste of Local Color and Unexpected Guests<p>
Tif, still dancing, thinks of Clovis, simple pleasures of watching Moths zap to their dooms in neon signs and another plea for
assistance in the kitchen.  BB comes out in frustration just as very bright lights (brighter than cousin Enos' double-wide) flood
the doughnut stop.  Little Green-Grey Men enter bearing rather phallic-shaped grease-oozing implements, causing BB to
suddenly fear for a part of his body which is a (loose) homonym of Tiffani's cousin's name.
<p>
<i>Act III</i> -- Wherein We Are Privileged With The Guest's Thoughts<p>
Here the guest is reavealed to be a rather nice and startlingly competent -- if green (ahem!) and inexperienced -- alien named
gRTz149f.  He wishes to assist the owners of the seemingly-grounded spacecraft (the trailer park doughnut shot and tanning
salon) in getting their vehicle spaceworthy.  The implements are revealed to be tools to Get the Job Done (no, not that job).  He
greets Tiffani and BB while his crew gets to work, but they are unsure of how to respond.  Unbeknownst to anyone (including
our readers at that point) there was a third member of the repair crew...
<p>
<h3>Act IV -- Wherein A Friend is Reunited and Communication is Established (sort of)</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/star3.gif alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
gRTz149f: [blinking] E---zffzzfszzsfzooo----EEEEEEE

have sufficiently gleaned enough of your vulgar tongue to *EGEST* effectively with you at this time.

BB:  [still showing his ass]
<p>
gRTz149f:  [waves his hand] I thank you for such a *PLACENTAL* greeting, but surely your lipo-gizzards are getting chilly
with such prolonged exposure.  The climate is much more balmy here than on *BELGIUM*, the place of origin of this
particular intergalactic standard *BEATING* where you could freeze your sacs off in no time.  Which is why of course such a
*BITCH-SLAPPING* is considered so high an honorary salutation.  [chuckles] Of course I notice the prodigious amount of
*HONEY* on your sacs...[leans in conspiratorily] which is why you can keep it up, eh? Umm, if you're interested I could

<p>
TIF:  They what?
<p>
CLOVIS:  My brain wasn't, uh, wired and tubed properly, and they fixed it.

<p>
CLOVIS:  [Pauses a long moment as if debating something]  Yeah, Tif.  Just like that.

<h3><a href=mailto:boniqua@yahoo.com>Boniqua24</a> begins a love affair novel 12/07/98</h3>
As Brad walked into the salon where Angel worked it was like his body held 
her eyes, she had never seen something or someone so gorgous in her life.
As he spoke to her, " Hello Angel." it was if her heart jumped out of her body.
Who ever knew that this would be the beginning of a love affair that she
never imagined. <p>The first meeting was at a local bar while her husband was 
at work (he always worked 5p.m.to 3a.m.), They talked about work just to 
break the silence, as the conversation continued they spoke about whether 
their little friendship (so they called it) was a good idea. Brad ensured
Angel that there was no problem,he always had a way of making everything bad
sound so good. They continued the night and decided it was time to leave 
when the clock hit 2:15, and seeing as how they both had quit a bit to 
drink. As Brad helped Angel out of her seat she slowly started to stumble,
but Brad quickly came to the rescue and broke her fall, she looked into his
glowing green eyes and slowly and seductively said " Thank you." <p>
They made their way 
out to the car and Brad slowly got closer to Angel's trembling lips and gave
her the kiss that would steal her heart and maybe her soul. The time was
now 2:35 as Brad invited Angel to his house,and without one regret she took 
him up on his offer. They got to Brad's house lavished with silk sheets,
wine, candle light, and the sultry sounds of Barry White. It was almost 
as if he had this all planned out. There wasn't much talking done before 
the two of them started to undress each other and made passionate love. <p>
Angel didn't make it home until 1:00 the next day, because Brad insisted 
she stay and let him make her breakfast, and of course she did. As she 
finally left all of those feelings of joy,and peace were gone, now all she 
could think of was what in the hell was she going to tell her husband.
She started to cry now thinking of all the things she should have thought
of before this whole crime of hearts began. As she entered in her house she
felt like she was dying, as she saw her husband and the words of her 
poor excuse started to roll off of her lips "Honey you will never 
believe what happ....." she was cut off. <p>
"Save it Angel I already know 
where you were, Brad come on out." Angel almost fainted "Oh my God." Brad
slyly said " You didn't really think I loved you after one day did you."
Angel's husband said " Don't be broken-hearted honey, you win some, you lose 
some." Angel turned and walked out it was all a conspiracy, a short-lived 
affair that wasn't worth the price she would surely pay.

<h3><a href=mailto:brainard@ctesc.net>Linda Marie 'Pendle' Brainard</a> begins a Victoriana novel 12/05/98</h3>
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess 
  and on to the hot tropic sands of Hawaii with Diamond Head laughing it up behind her back.<p>
     She had told her auntie Mabel, only days earlier, when and if she married-  she would either do it so fast she could not back
out, or be so drunk she wouldn't know what she was doing.
     Well, at least (even drunk) she knew money and prestige when she saw it.  She may suffer emotionally and/or physically at
the hands of this strange new husband, but would never be worried about finances again.<p>
     Ah Yes, even in the midst of a drunken stupor her silver spoon continued to have a steadfast hold in her rosebud mouth.
Who should she be to complain or look a gift horse in the mouth?  Only problem was- that's exactly what he reminded her of-
A HORSE, that is A HORSE'S ASS!
He sure looked 'nerdy' to have the title of Duke.  In bed together?  Heaven forbid!  They'd be seen together in public for
prosperity's sake, but he would just have to accept the fact that she wanted no part of sleeping with him!  At least, NOT
WHILE SOBER!  However, not knowing what took place during her drunken honeymoon state, the damage could already
have been done.  The very thought of a 'like' nerdy little Duke, in miniature, growing inside her made her usual hang-over much
harder to bare.  Perish the thought!  She was a proper lady no more- in her own eyes!  Mummy would undoubtedly become
quite faint if she knew the latest escapades of her 'littlest princess' now!

emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.<p>  The cleric, named Jonas, kneeled before Emperor Zog, while peering attentively, hoping the
emperor was not in a foul mood.  Emperor Zog nodded at the cleric as if to ask what the problem was. Jonas informed
Emperor Zog of a terrible atrocity which occurred out in the Plain Fields this very afternoon and asked for an emergency
session.  Emperor Zog squinted his eyes and told Jonas to proceed.  Abruptly, the cleric rose and proceeded to call the case. <p>
  "Hear ye, Hear ye!" the cleric shouted, "an item of consultation by our great Emperor Zog this afternoon, is the case between
the Wench of Big Tatas versus Salesman Shite. Will you two please come forward."
<p>
A heavy woman in her mid 20s waddled on over to her podium, as a skinny man with gigantic, bulging eyes and a crown of
fiery red hair, followed suit. Emperor Zog didn't read the disposition, as usual, and gently whispered to proceed.
<p>
"Proceed, Miss Tatas" Jonas roared.
<p>
"Thank you, your excellency."she began. "Well, your excellency, the case is very simple. My virtue has been stolen, to put it
honestly." A slight murmur swept across the mass of people who were gathered behind.
<p>
"And I take it Mr. Shite stole it, huh?" the Emperor asked.
<p>
"Why, yes, your excellency, he did! It happened just a few moments ago. I was tending my sheep as I do every afternoon. You
see, my parents are old and feeble and as their only child I tend the farm during the day."
<p>
"And what do you do at night?"the Emperor asked quickly.
<p>
"I take care of my old and feeble parents." Miss Tatas replied. "May I continue?"
<p>
"Proceed"
<p>
"Thank you. Well, as I was tending the sheep a man passed by. That man,your excellency!"She pointed a fat finger in the
direction of our salesman. "That man right there! He approached me, your excellency,and professed some sort of love for me,
calling me a "vision" a "lovely creature" and what have you.
<p>
"Yes" the Emperor said.
<p>
"Well, your excellency, I was shocked at these words, especially from a stranger. As we began speaking, that man and I...well,
it became evident that he was becoming aroused."
<p>
"How did you know that?" Emperor Zog roared.
<p>
"Well, your excellency, he may look small, but he's packing quite a package for a little man." the crowd roared with laughter as
our salesman looked down and blushed crimson.
<p>
"Silence!"  Emperor Zog screamed as a hush came over the crowd. "Continue."
<p>
"Thank you, your excellency. As I noticed that he was aroused, I became uncomfortable. Mr. Shite showed me the purple purse
he was carrying. It is full of gold pieces from the commerce he transacted in this very town. He shows me these gold pieces to
persuade me to have relations with him." an obvious gasp was heard from the crowd, as our salesman continued facing
downwards. "I told him that I was not a harlot, but a sensible woman. Your excellency, he just wouldn't take no for an answer
and kept professing his "love" for me." Miss Tatas paused. "Then...your excellency...then it happened!"
<p>
"What happened?" Emperor Zog asked.
<p>
"He took my virtue, he took advantage of me, your excellency!" she cried, as she broke into a dry sob.
<p>
"Well,well..."Emperor Zog said as he leaned back into his throne. "What a shame, Miss Tatas. Let me ask you one question."
<p>
"Yes?" Miss Tatas replied, sniffling a dry nose.
<p>
"What do you believe his punishment should be?" Emperor Zog asked in his regal tone.
<p>
"I believe I deserve that purse! He took my virtue, your excellency, and that money should be fair compensation. I have a poor
family, sir." Miss Tatas proclaimed.
<p>
"I see. Well, young man, I see you got yourself in a bind, huh?" Emperor Zog said, turning to face the salesman. "What have
you got to say for yourself?"
<p>
"Well,your excellency." Mr.Shite began. "Some of what Miss Tatas says is true,except for a few things, if I may relate to you."
<p>
"You may" Emperor Zog answered.
<p>
"It is true I met her as she was tending sheep" the salesman began, "but she was the one who approached me. I didn't pay much
attention to her, but she kept conversing with me, asking who I was, why I was in town and the like. As our conversation grew
she asked what was in my purple purse, which I carry for my business transactions. I allowed her to look inside and she
suddenly got even friendlier than before. And before I knew what was happening, she was all over me, kissing me, feeling me,
touching me, sucking me.."
<p>
"We got the picture!"Emperor Zog interrupted.
<p>
"Well,your excellency, we did have relations, but due to her prodding,not mine. And that's the truth." the salesman paused as
the Emperor held up his hand and motioned for the cleric to come closer.
<p>
Jonas hurried to the Emperor's side and leaned forward.
"Let's hurry this thing up,my boy. I am gonna make a decision." Emperor Zog whispered.
<p>
"As you wish,your excellency" Jonas replied. Gathering everyone's attention, Jonas said, " Hear ye, Hear ye, the great Emperor
Zog has come to a decision."
<p>
Emperor Zog rose up and slowly petting the fur-trimming of his cape, he walked down majestically towards the salesman.
Calmly, Emperor Zog picked up the purple purse heavy with gold coins and handed the purse to Miss Tatas. A huge smile
swept across her face as she opened the purse and glared at the coins. The salesman was dumbfounded, as his jaw fell to the
floor.  The Emperor looked back at the salesman and gave a quick wink. The salesman frowned for he didn't understand what
the Emperor was doing. The Emperor then walked to the foot of the majestic steps and turned to face all and he spoke.
<p>
"Listen all, I have awarded the Wench of Tatas this purple purse of gold, becuase I believe she is the victim here. Therefore, the
Shite salesman must pay the fees for his overflowing passions. So it has been said, so it is done, for I said it!"  
<p>
Emperor Zog struck a majestic pose as the crowd shouted and applauded the judgement. The Wench of Tatas began laughing
and smiling a large toothy smile, while holding the purple purse up for all to see.  The salesman appeared to be on the verge of
crying. The Emperor then walked up the stairs and as he sat down on his majestic throne, announced to the crowd that the case
was now "Dismissed!"
<p>
As the young lady looked up to Emperor Zog with a gracious look, she clutched the purse towards her person.  As she turned
to walk away, the Emperor motioned to one guard standing next to him.  The guard promptly walked up to the Emperor.  The
Emperor looked at the muscular guard and spoke: "Go get that purse from Miss Tatas and bring it here, I want to have a look
inside." 
<p>
"Yes, your excellency" the guard replied, excitedly.
<p>
Miss Tatas was already heading for the door well in view of the Emperor.  The guard rushed towards Miss Tatas and promptly
asked for the purple purse.
<p>
"Why?" she asked, "Emperor Zog declared that the purse belonged to me."
<p>
"Well, hand it over to me." the guard commanded.
<p>
"I will not!" she screamed, clutching the purple purse.
<p>
"Yes you will!" the guard screamed as he grabbed a hold of the purse. But Miss Tatas had a firm hold also on the purple purse
and was holding on as if her life depended on it. The guard pulled, tugged, and even jerked at the purse, but Miss Tatas still
held her position, never loosening her grip. Emperor Zog was watching this commotion from his throne with a slight smile on his
face. As the guard and Miss Tatas struggled for the purse, Miss Tatas kept screaming "It's mine! It's mine!! It's mine!!!"
<p>
Slowly, Emperor Zog rose once again. "Stop!" he roared. The struggle between the muscle-bound guard and Miss Tatas was
put to an end.
<p>
"Come over here." Emperor Zog commanded. "Now, Miss Tatas. I want you to give that purple purse back to Mr. Shite."
<p>
"What?" she screamed,unable to believe what she was hearing. "But you just said it belonged to me."
<p>
"Give it back!" Emperor Zog roared. 
<p>
Reluctantly, Miss Tatas gave up the purse to the guard who walked over to Mr. Shite and handed him the purple purse.
Gleaming, Mr. Shite looked into his purse and a look of joy swept across his face. Contrastly, Miss Tatas looked at Mr. Shite
then shot a look at the Emperor.
<p>
"But why?" she asked.
<p>
"Miss Tatas, I must explain myself and I will." Emperor Zog began "The situation is very simple. You were lying, and I know
you lied. For if your story was true, your virtue would be intact. Because, if you held your virtue as tightly and as highly as you
held that purple purse to your breast, we wouldn't have had this whole charade. Now, the case is dismissed."
<p>
Emperor Zog sat down upon his throne and majestically smiled,glancing at Jonas and Mr. Shite. The smile resonated throughout
the whole room; the smile relayed the greatness of our hero, Emperor Zog.
