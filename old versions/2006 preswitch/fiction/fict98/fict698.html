<h3><a href=mailto:skbj@worldnet.att.net>B. Clinton</a> begins a Mystery novel 06/30/98</h3>

"Yes," I told the eager, young intern, "I am the President of the United States of America.  
It is a huge responsibility, and I have a terrible headache right now."  
She offered to rub my royal temples and I laughed heartily, and told her not to be silly.  
"I'm not royalty" I pointed out, "merely the President of the United States of America."  
Then I pulled my pants down and did a little dance on the Oval Office desk.  
I stepped on a pen and it hurt, but I would not cry because I am the President of the United 
States of America.

Belina knew he was a dark and stormy knight, but she loved her 
Ethelred to distraction, even if he seemed curiously unready 
to make a commitment. 
She had plied him with meade and delicate viands and polished his 
halberd nightly to no avail. "If I could just get my hands on some 
bootleg Viagra", she thought. "Perhaps that would do the trick."

        gRTz149f led his troops — albeit only three of them, for he was but yet
an interplanetary intern barely past the First Order, Level A, Green
section, and had yet to prove himself—toward the alien craft, which was
obviously made on an inferior metal, and save for a rather tall antenna
on one end, did not seem to sport any communications equipment worthy of
note. Indeed, gRTz149f wondered how the strange craft flew at all,
and—judging by the green, apparently growing vegetation surrounding it
(a substance that seemed to irritate most of    gRTz149f's dorsal
receptor-nerons)—it had not flown for quite some time. A tiny speck of
doubt raised its minute head in the back lobe ofgRTz149f's
lower-anterior sub-maxillary brainstem, and he considered the
possibility that this craft was not the one that his commander had
ordered him to seek out and rehabilitate, but gRTz149f, professional
that he was, dismissed the doubt—or at least relegated it to a cranial
subcompartment to be retrieved later for advance conjecture. Holding his
left appendage high and projecting the attitude of bravado that had
marked him for greatness at the Mfwrtz Intergalactic Academy, he
signaled his troops to bring their Amorphose Subglomulatary System
regulators onto the alien craft which, gRTz149f noticed, bore a small
plaque on its end with an inscription that noted "Beech Deluxe Model-A7,
Bubba's Trailer Sales and Tanning Salon, Ltd," and      gRTz149f wished he
were able to decipher the alien message, for he felt sure that it held a
key to the craft's mysterious and antiquarian look.
<p>
Nonetheless, his party had arrived to study and rehabilitate the alien
craft, and gRTz149f felt—as much as a Mfwrtzian could feel, for his was
primarily a thinking, not feeling, race— it was his obligation to render
what aid he could. As he noticed two of the craft's inhabitants, it
occured to him that this might be a craft belonging to a peculiarly
primitive, albeit backward, race, and any help he could give them would
not be nearly enough to bring them up to intergalactic standards (at
least as set forth in the newly revised manual). To show that h meant no
harm, he blinked three of his eyes in the universal signal for
friendship, but the pair of aliens (whether different sexesor possibly
just variant levels of the same sex, gRTz149f wasn't quite sure) gaped
at him with open ocular and oral cavities, a signal that wasn't on the
list of standard intergalactic greetings.  gRTz149f decided that
wariness was the order of the day.

     Meanwhile, Tif was in the dining room of the doughnut shop, gyrating sadly to the radio.  At this hour of night, when radio signals from all over the county grew, Puff-Daddy started to cross with "Achy Breaky Heart."  The combination was not unpleasant, thought Tif.
<p>
     She turned in the slowly flashing red neon light outlining the shop's smiling-doughnut logo.  The smiling doughnut (its hole was squashed into a crescent to give the effect of a smile) was held by a widely grinning man with a red-checkered shirt with several tubes of white neon outlining his teeth.  A few tubes were burned out, giving him rather more of an authentic look than anticipated.  The doughnut was dunked, still smiling in one moment, and then in the next moment the man was biting the lower half of the now-wide-eyed doughnut off, with the hole forming a very surprised "O" that somewhat resembled a scream.  
<p>
     Some sulphur-winged moths danced around the sign, occasionally zapping to their dooms if they got too close to an exposed socket.  Tif wondered where Clovis was.  Clovis would stand and stare for hours watching the sign and the moths.  Such simple pleasures, thought Tif.
<p>
     "Tif, where in Sam-hill are you? I got cheese dripping all over the place here! Get that pretty little head o' yourn in here!" called Billy-Bob.
<p>
     "Comin', BB," she responded.  As she turned to go the the kitchen, a sound she first took to be a large truck sounded suddenly behind her.  There was a flash of brilliant blue-white light from behind her, causing her shadow to erupt on the counter in front of her.  She slowly turned around.  That there was no truck headlights, she thought...not even cousin Enos' double-wide with extra floods and chasers -- and no less than three batteries to power the whole thing -- made that much of a searing blaze.
<p>
     "Girl, what the hell's keeping...you...uh..." Billy-Bob started as he emerged from the kitchen, his initial ire supplanted by disbelief and wonder.
<p>
     Before them, the features of a small blue figure slowly emerged from the near-blinding light.  Big-headed and black-eyed, he put up his left appendage, seemingly in a greeting.  Billy-Bob and Tif did the same, slowly.  
<p>
     The alien then pointed quickly forward with the same hand, and three other aliens of varying shades of blue emerged carrying enormous cylanders made out of some sort of transparent material.  The devices were about two feet long, and hooked at the base to a round, black, rubbery-looking cap with glowing lights and tubes.  A tube ran through the center of the device, and it seemed to pump some sort of gooey, greasy looking fluid to the tip of the instrument.  Billy-Bob and Tif both had the phrase "business end" come to mind, but Billy may have been a bit swifter on the uptake.
<p>
     "Jesus Christ almighty, they're...they're gonna probe my anus," Billy-Bob noted with a tone of outright fear, wonderment, and perhaps an ever-so-mild salacious intrigue.
<p>
     Tif looked at Billy-Bob and wondered what her cousin had to do with all this.

<h3>Anonymous begins a Coming of Age novel 06/03/98</h3>

Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?<p>
  Could she have forseen that the pale, well-dressed young man she had seen flying past her window the night before would behave so strangely upon being let in?... No, anyone would have made the same mistake.  
Beverly pulled out her compact to check her appearance.  Unfortunately, there was no reflection to go by.  Sighing heavily, she replaced the makeup in her green backpack.  There was nothing for her at this school anymore.  Once word got around that she had bitten Tiffany Miller on the neck...Well, the rumors would never stop! Suddenly, glancing around, Beverly felt her heart lighten.  Across the football field she could see the marching band warming up.  New friends!  That group would take anybody!  Running her tongue over her newly sharpened canines, Beverly hurried to join the group--choosing a place near an overweight trumpeter.  Perhaps, she thought, his weight will prevent his escape.  The day was turning out better than she had hoped.

<h3><a href=mailto:_sandy_@rocketmail.com>Sandra Helmick</a> begins a Fantasy novel 06/02/98</h3>
Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?
  All Beverly could think about was revenge.  What could she do to Jane that 
would be good enough to be payback.  Beverly knew Jane like to drink, so 
in her head she knew what had to be done.  Beverly went home and dressed to
go out to Jake's Bar and Grill.  Jane was there.  Beverly spoke and sat on 
the stool next to Jane.  She waited until Jane got up to dance to spike her
drink.  By that time Jane was almost falling down drunk and would not notice 
the funny taste in her drink.  Beverly dumped castor oil into the drink, using
the whole bottle.  Jane was so thirsty from dancing, she sat down and in one
gulp drank the whole thing.  Beverly went home.  The next day at cheerleading
practice Beverly watched from under the bleachers.  All she could see was Jane 
running to the bathroom every few minutes.  Mission accomplished.  Beverly felt
better and Jane was too busy to notice all the other cheerleaders laughing 
at her.

<h3>E.B. Black begins a family drama novel 06/02/98</h3>
<a href=crabs.gif><img src=crabthb.gif align="right"></a>
     "We love to eat at Joe's crabhouse... I't's yum, yum, delicious."<P>
     "Cut!" Screamed the director. Your acting career is over, Van Boobs! For years you have 
relied on the talent of young, helpless Swedish children and now fate has revenged you with bad children who can't act. Go back to singing!
<P>
    "It had been years since the TenBoobs' careers were ruined. They were forced into the mafia. Grandpa Boob moved his way up as "Father Boobio"; "Little Kimmy" and "Petie the red terror" became infamous drug dealers. One day Petie got busted on a sting operation and was forced to give the names of his family members.
<P>
     Now the TenBoobs make licence plates in the NYPD jail, but not before they sent a fellow mafia member to bomb Joe's Crab house.

<h3><a name="tif1">Remy Trudeau</a> begins a Trailer Park novel 06/01/98</h3>
   Billy-Bob's Trailer Park and Donut Shop was glistening with austere moonlight 
and Tiffani danced to the beat of Puff-Daddy in her pink spandex with the apathetic glare of a 
bored and broken stripper. She was torqued!<p>
She had just been fired from the Piggly Wiggly for tokin' in the meat department. 
She bopped and flipped her beautifully bleached blonde main like a
like an Arabian in heat. Her body glistened with moisture and her mascara
dripped from her sparse lashes like bootblack on white-face. <p>
"Tif, get your ba-Hankas in here, I forgot the recipe for this Cheez-wiz delight."
