<h1>Day 2 - Developing the Mission Statement</h1>
To develop the mission statement, I used the exercises in <i>The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement for Work and For Life</i> by Laurie Beth Jones.  I found the exercises good, but the book itself a little hoky.  This is how it leads off, though:
<p>
<i>There are three simple elements to a good mission statement:
<p>
1. A mission statement should be no more than a single sentence long.

2. It should be easily understood by a twelve-year-old.

3.  It should be able to be recited <i>by memory</i> at gunpoint.

<i>Looking back on this, I don't think I quite nailed all three of those.  Judge for yourself...</i>

and here are the exercises.
<p>
<h2>The Four Elements</h2>
<h3>Think about the four elements: earth, air, water and fire.  Which one are you most like?</h3>

<i>This baffled me.  I didn't have an easy or fitting answer to this.  My journal says, </i> 
I don't feel a strong affinity for any of the four, but I would have to say <b>Earth</b>.  Earth is solid, unpreposession, but can provide sustenance and support.  My teaching is like what the earth gives to plants.  <p>
Earth needs the fire, the water and the air to do its job, otherwise it's just rock.
<p>
I should be consciously more nurturing.<p>
<i>I had a note from ten days later - I looked up "nurture" to make sure I really understood what it meant.  It means "to feed, educate or contribute to the well-being of others."
<p>
<h3>List at least twelve characteristics this element has.</b></h3>
1) Solid<br>
2) Nurturing<br>
3) definite<br>
4) strong<br>
5) supportive<br>
6) needed by many to grow<br>
7) worn down by water, air and fire<br>
8) different consistency depending on context<br>
9) dirty<br>
10) neeed the water, air and fire to continue to be supportive (meeting art, caprice, love, excitement)<br>
11) Rolling hills<br>
12. I look best in earth tones, dammit!
<p>
<h3>Now describe what this element does - list at least 12 verbs that go with it.</h3>
Earth does the following:<br>
1) Supports<br>
2) Gives<br>
3) Solidifies<br>
4) buries<br>
5) reclaims<br>
6) quakes and avalanches<br>
7) houses<br>
8) hides<br>
9) unites (localizes)<br>
10) reaches up and down<br>
11) detoxifies<br>
12) shields<br>
<p>
<h3>Take your name and insert it before your element.</h3>
I, Eric Peterson, am earth.
<p>
<i>And I, Eric Peterson, am rolling my eyes.  But, have faith, keep going.  The book then instructs you to "write down all the characteristics you just listed in the previous two exercises, and write your statement at the bottom.  You have now created a powerful word picture of yourself.  Repeat this poem daily for 30 days, adding new words as they occur to you."  I never did this.  From my journal, </i>This does not feel right.  NOTE for later - repeat with other elements.  <i>I never did this either.</i>  
<h3>Draw a word picture about yourself that is not an element.  Describe the first image that comes to mind, without editing</h3>
I am a lighthouse!  I stand tall, warning of dangers and delighting the eye!  (don't know about this) <i>hee!</i>

from ten days later - my partner says I am not one element.  I am a mixture.  I think he said I was definitley not water.  I think earth and fire.
