Postscript to Eric's Retreat

<b>Feb, 2003</b> - ah yes, the abandoned husk of a project.  No really, I am going to finish this.  
My current thought is to make the anniversary of the retreat the occasion for finishing this up.  
It will give me an opportunity to regroup and reflect.
<p>
The best thing I've done since the retreat is to journal.  The deep dark stuff goes to paper, but 
I'm also <a href=http://stanharding.livejournal.com>blogging</a>.  Also, some of the issues 
that were sort of resolved in a half-assed way on the retreat came to a head this past year.  I'm 
learning to deal with those things via Al-Anon, which is giving me a whole new set of tools 
to help build my own foundational structure.
<p>
There is way more to share, and I will, I promise.
