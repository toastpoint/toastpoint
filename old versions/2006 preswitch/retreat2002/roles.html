<h1>The Roles We Play</h1></center>
I'm a huge believer that we play many roles in our life (thank you, Wm. Shakespeare) and your role in any given situation determines your responsibility and your behavior.  I took the opportunity after reviewing humanism to list my roles and my thoughts on each.
<hr>
<h2>My Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Captain of my own life.
<li>Domestic partner and love slave (heh)
<li>Son
<li>Brother
<li>Relative
<li>Community member
<li>Resident of Jackson Heights
<li>New Yorker
<li>American
<li>Citizen of the world
<li>Human being
<li>My current jobs
<li>Other accepted responsibilities
</ul>
<h3>Some Thoughts on These</h3>
Part of the problems over the last few years is that I have taken on too much responsibility - or conversely, have not prepared myself for the responsibility I've taken on.

I think that job responsibility - or any assumption of a formal position, such as "technical writer for Bigcorp" or "artistic director of New York's gay concert band" is different in that it's theoretically more defined and circumscribed - and is also assumed by mutual agreement and can be severed more easily than others.  More on this further down.
<hr>
<h2>Captain of My Own Life</h2>
Is there anything that needs definition about my role in relationship to myself?  Almost no, since this whole exercise implies my course.  But my role for me is:<p>
1. Maintain myself in the five areas: spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, to provide the case for my work.
<p>
2. Guide myself towards enrichment and achievement of goals and fulfillment of roles.

<h3>Spirituality</h3>
How do I maintain and improve my spirituality?  By performing exercises like this, following through and fine tuning.

<h3>Mental Health</h3>
How do I maintain and improve my own mental health?  By adjusting physical behavior to avoid processes that inhibit mental health. (<i>by, for instance, not drinking to excess, by maintaining physical health, by monitoring my own emotional swings</i>).  By always exercising my mind.  By meditation and review.  <i>By this sort of retreat, and followup.</i>

<h3>Emotional Health</h3>
How do I maintain and improve emotional health?  By allowing and embracing feelings, but detaching them from responses.  By tracking down the source of bad feeling and doing something concrete - either creating an action plan and carrying it out to improve the situation, or to accept that you have no power of it, and moving on.

<h3>Physical Health</h3>
How do I maintain and improve physical health?  By regular exercise and use of the body, and by avoiding ingesting things that are bad for me.  By followup with medical people when I have a problem.  By being aware of and accepting my body and tracking changes, and treating it well.  <p>
This is such a big issue now.
<p>
<i>And now in 2004, it's still a big issue.  I still have a weight problem.  I have, however, joined a gym and enjoy working out I'm not doing it regularly enough though to make a big difference.
<p>
I'm currently reading and working on the exercises in <b>Life is Hard, Food is Easy</b> by Linda Spangler - a book that addresses issues with emotional eating.  It's a good book.  Let's see if I have the follow-thru to stick with its plan.</i>

<h3>How do I maintain myself financially?</h3>
By continuing to work, by saving, by spending wisely, by establishing financial goals.
<p>
<i>This was going better than it is now.  I had a chunk of money in savings, but have blown a significant portion of it.  For good stuff, but... I had gotten used to a once-yearly check I'd been getting from the sale of my old company, but this is the first year that check hadn't come in.  Also, the raises have gotten a lot smaller over the last few years.

<p>
I'm in fine shape and have no debt, but should really tighten it up for planning in case of financial disaster.</i>
<h3>How do I guide myself towards enrichment and achievement of goals and fulfillment of roles?</h3>
By establishing and defining goals, roles and responsibilities, meeting them, and reviewing and adjusting to stay on track.

<h2>My Role as a Family Member</h2>
<i>I'm not including the excerpt from my journal here, because it's private, but I examined my relationships with my parents, with my sister, with my various relatives and with my partner.  </i>
<hr>
<h2>My Role as a Friend</h2>
What are my responsibilities as a friend.  I think in general, keep in contact, remember birthdays, keep up with how the kids are doing. <i>All of which I'm terrible at.</i>  
<p>
Further study: explore what it means to be a friend and reasons to <u>end</u> a friendship.  What's the difference between a "friend" and a "good friend"?  "Best friend"?  "Acquaintance"?
<p>
<i>Here, commenting in 2004, I think my relationships with friends is something that needs a lot of work.  I feel that I should be spending a lot more time paying attention to my friends, but I also feel that I have friends who are needlessy needy.   What to do, what to do?</i>
<hr>
<h2>My Role as a Resident</h2>
What are my responsibilities to my neighborhood?  To the town I live in?  To my state?  Country?  The world?  The universe?

Well, I took a look at this and figure the farther out you get, the less responsibility you have - for instance, I should pay far more attention to my role as a Jackson Heights resident than to my role as a world resident - but not neglect either.  I noted the following in my journal: good citizen, support local organizations and businesses, libraries.  Find out what the local concerns are and pay attention to them.  Study the issues before a vote, then vote.  
<p>
<i>To be honest, I do a very poor job of this.</i>
<p>
What are my responsibilities as an American?  What can I do to make it a better place?  <i>This is a big issue now since the country's really gone downhill in the last four years and I personally have not put any energy into halting that slide.</i>

<hr>
<h2>My Role as a Community Member</h2>
Here I'm talking about adopted communities - the gay community, the musical community, the Gilbert & Sullivan people and so on.  I have a general note to "give back to what you draw from".
<hr>
<h2>My Role at Work</h2>
<i>My roles and responsibilities at work are much more artificial since the agreement to take the responsibility is much more formal and contractual.  In my journal, I wrote,</i> 
My role at work should be defined by management.  Where management fails to define my role, I should actively define it for the company.  Either way, my job should not become all-encompassing.  Defining the roles and responsibilities establishes clear boundaries and at least helps to put the brakes on getting random jobs dumped on you.
<p>
That being said, there is a connection, I feel, between my lack of involvement and how poorly I feel we run our business.  However, that is probably silly.  I can only do so much in my current position and am not willing to move to a higher one with more responsibility at this point.  <i>Now in 2004, things have changed somewhat.  The work situation has improved greatly and I also have some great opportunities to actually affect how we do business.</i>  At work I should establish my own set of goals, priorities and responsibilities.  I should do this on company time.  My responsibility there is stricktly for hire, except that, of course, I am personally involved in my own financial status.
