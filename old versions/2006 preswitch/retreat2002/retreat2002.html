Toast Point's Personal Retreat: May, 2002
</title>

<body>
<h1>I've never been to Paradise...</h1>
<h2>but I <u>have</u> been to me!</h2>

This is the story of the personal retreat I took in May 2002.  
<p>
I want to describe
<ul>
<li>what motivated me 
to take a retreat
<li>how I structured it
<li>and what came out of it.  
</ul>
<p>
This is primarily for my own benefit, as 
putting this together will remind me of the events and help me remember what was accomplished.
<p>
But - it's also for <b>your</b> 
benefit.  I did a lot of internet research before going and could not find that many sources on how to create your own 
secular personal retreat.  I'll not only be sharing my personal results, but reviewing the books and 
techniques I used, and sharing what worked for me and what didn't.
<p>
Certainly, this will be dull to most, and seem self-serving to many.  But the great thing about the 
Internet is that people who <em>are</em> interested in this sort of thing will be able to find it.  All 
others can browse, titter, grimace and move on.

<p>
Anyway, here goes...

<h4>Introduction</h4>
As I've stumbled through the painful process of learning how to be an adult, it has become clear 
from time to time that you need some sort of guiding principles to give your life structure and meaning.  
Many get this from their religion, but I'm not a religious person and am unwilling to buy into a 
"storebought" life structure.  Society offers familiar (and familial) roles to play, such as worker, 
American, father, son, husband and so on.  Certainly, if I had children, my life's purpose would immediately 
be clear - to raise my children to be self-sufficient adults and good citizens.  
<p>
But I am well aware that I am the captain of my own life, and if I'm not steering it, I'm not going to go anywhere 
interesting.  I am also aware that I am responsible for my own personal happiness.
<p>
In the past, when I've overbooked myself and have gotten to an unhappy and uncertain state of mind, I've 
explored various methods for building a solid foundation for my life.  This started, I would say, in the 
early '90s when I was living in Philadelphia.  I bought a wonderful book called 
<a href=http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/books/life1/lf1toc.htm>Life 101</a> by 
<a href=http://www.mcwilliams.com>Peter McWilliams</a>.  You're welcome to browse the book yourself online.  
I'm going to be writing further down about exactly how the book has worked (and has not worked) for me, 
and I also hope to go into a side trip about McWilliams's own interesting story.
<p>
Anyway, Life 101 was a good start and I reread it several times along the way.

<h3>The 2001-2002 "school year"</h3>
About summertime in 2001, I was feeling overwhelmed and completely unhappy.  Although my relationship was fine, 
I'd just finished a grueling <a href=http://www.lgbac.org>band</a> season and my job had gone through 
some horrendous changes.  I was feeling very unsettled and started to get the idea for a personal 
retreat.  I did some online research for retreat houses within an easy drive of New York City, but 
I didn't get much farther with my plans than surfing the net.
<p>

The band "year" for me is pretty much all year, as when I'm off-duty, I'm preparing for the next season.  But it mainly 
runs from September to April and involves at least two major concerts and one chamber music concert, plus 
little events like Christmas caroling.  By the time Charles and I took an amazing 
restful vacation in Scotland, I was totally prepared.  My first rehearsal was the day after we came back.  I was all set, so all I had to do was go to work, then to band.  We had a glorious and fun first rehearsal, but exhausting. We were jumping off the starting block for the whole 
season.  And I didn't get home til midnight, finishing off a long Monday.  Monday, September 10, 2001.
<p> The next day, I got up a little late and ended up coming out of the subway at West 4th Street at 9:45.  And... well, you can read Charles's 
account of 9/11 <a href=http://www.toastpoint.com/writing/sept11.html>here</a>.
<p>
Bottom line is - by the time fall and Christmas was over, I had:
<ul>
<li>conducted one highly emotional concert
<li>completed a technical course and was in the 
middle of another one
<li>was preparing two spring concerts two months apart.
</ul>
I was fraying at all my edges.  

Again, the lack of centering was causing me to act reactively to all my situations and I felt I was 
pinballing all over my life.  
<hr>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
Meanwhile, a gathering of Gilbert &Sullivan <s>freaks</s> enthusiastics was being organized.  I've participated in several of these - you come in for a weekend, sing through shows, party, have a great time.  This event took place in Orlando, Florida in May 2002.  Perfect timing - enough time 
for me to recover from the spring band concert and prepare for the event, but not get in the way of summer band 
activities.  Once I realized I was going to Florida in May, I jumped on the opportunity to take some extra time 
and finally do this retreat and maybe get my head together.
<p>
A few questions online for a quiet quaint place to spend a few days in Florida led me to research 
<a href=http://www.tarponsprings.com>Tarpon Springs</a> on the Gulf coast.  Tarpon Springs is known for two things - 
a thriving Greek population and for sponge-diving.  Well, I like Greek food well enough and sponges were something 
I could take or leave, but it sounded like a nice enough place.
<p>
Some more web surfing gave me some lodging options.  Originally, I wanted to rent an efficiency apartment, but the one I found and loved turned out to be unavailable.  Eventually, I decided to splurge and stayed at the 
<a href=http://www.springbayouinn.com/>Spring Bayou Inn</a>, a lovely Bed & Breakfast.  I stayed in the 
Azalea room.

<h3>The Mind Picture</h3>
I pictured myself sitting at an elegant writing desk, or on a beach towel, or in a library, or in a lovely park.  Someplace peaceful that would allow me to scribble all my thoughts down and read and ponder and record.  When I reserved a room at the Inn, I tried to get one that had a desk area, but none of the rooms had one.  As it turned out, the Azalea room had a little mini-room between the bedroom and bathroom with a comfy chair (a comfy chair!) that served for my indoor writing needs.

<h3>Craig Park</h3>
I was so happy when I showed in Tarpon Springs.  I had pictured in my head that I would do most of my 
work holed up in my room, the living room of the B&B, or find a park somewhere in town.  If none of that 
worked, I'd find the local library.  But here it turned out that the B&B was a half block from the 
<em>perfect</em> park - Craig Park, which was right on the water.  
<p>
My pictures of Craig Park are <a href=http://www.ofoto.com/I.jsp?m=37563038403&n=1755663647>here</a> - please look 
at them.  I couldn't believe how lucky I was to find the perfect spot.  (Note - Ofoto now requires you to 
create an account to see the pictures, but it's free.  Use your Yahoo or hotmail account.)  Anyway, it 
was right on the water, was just lovely, and the rec center had a picnic area and bathrooms, so I was all set.  
I ended up spending each morning in the park, leaving when it got too hot, getting lunch, then finishing up 
in my lovely air-conditioned room.
<hr>
<h3>The Structure</h3>
So anyway, the day I got there, I did some preliminary work.  Now, what I had done up til this 
point was read various books and register in my mind the issues that I needed to address.  So on 
Monday afternoon, I sat in my little chair in the Azalea room and decided I'd do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Tuesday would be about the <a href=credo.html>credo</a>.
<li>
Wednesday would be about the <a href=mission.html>mission statement</a>.
<li>
and Thursday would be about various <a href=issues.html>issues</a>.
</ul>
