<h1>The Four Agreements</h1></center>
<i>The Four Agreements</i> by don Miguel Ruiz, is billed as a "wisdom book" and a "practical guide for personal freedom".  From the back cover: <i>Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness and love.</i>
<p>
If you're anything like me, you've already started to roll your eyes.  And, honestly, when I read the book, <s>I thought most of it was bullshit</s> many of the book's ideas did not resonate with me.  Ruiz's precept is that the whole world is a dream.  While this may be true, and reminds me somewhat of Richard Bach's <i>Illusions</i>, I don't find it a helpful precept on which to base a life view.
<p>
<i>Side note: when I went on retreat, I had meant to reread Richard Bach's books and maybe it's time I did again.  They're also hippie-dippie crunchy-granola touchy-feely in a way that mostly I disdain and sometimes I really need.</i>
<p>
However, the actual four agreements that Ruiz asks you to make with yourself are quite sensible and I did examine those in detail on the retreat.  Below are the four agreements, and my thoughts from the journal.  <i>My current thoughts are in italics.</i>
<hr>
<h2>Agreement 1: Be Impeccable with Your Word</h2>
<h4>Speak with integrity.  Say only what you mean.  Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.  Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.</h4>

<i>From my journal 5/14/2002:</i>: This makes a lot of sense.  I always try to say exactly what I mean.  I don't like to gossip much, but sadly I do enjoy hearing it.  What about my participation in BHORC?  [<i>an online forum dedicated to trashing celebrities</i>]  Celebrities are fair game, I guess, but snark is bad in real life.  Perhaps the attitude comments from the band would decrease if I kept a lid on my snark.  [<i>the band periodically takes a survey that invites comments, and sometimes the comments are that I can be a little bitchy.  True, but I think I'm mostly remarkably patient with the band.  Compared to conductor meltdowns I've been on the wrong side of, I am an effing saint.  But that's neither here nor there.</i>]  Can you enjoy a clver snark if you uphold this agreement?
<p>
It's not snarky to tell someone you can't chat because you're busy.  It's not snarky to tell someone they have failed because they didn't do XYZ or that you expect better.  [<i>assuming that you are in a position where it would be appropriate to convey this information - such as my position with the band</i>]
<p>
<i>From my journal 5/25/2002</i>: Snarkitude and jokes can be considered verbal games.  However,everyone must be aware that it's not real.

[<i>Personally, I have found that although I continue to enjoy my online snark and a good bitchy turn of phrase, I am far less tolerant of it in person and am very quick to call someone on needlessly bitchy comments.  I'm just realizing as I write this that I have really internalized the "Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love" directive and have not been shy about proselytizing this concept...]</i>

<h2>Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally</h2>
<h4>Nothing others do is because of you.  What others say and do is a projection of their own reality.  When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.</h4>
<p>
<i>From my journal, 5/14/2002</i>: Now this one I don't buy, or not completely.  I guess the agreement does <u>not</u> say that you should discount what others do, but not to take it to heart.  If you can rationally evaluate others' actions and determine whether the feedback is appropriate.  I guess that the law does hold.  Life 101's detachment and 'don't react to inner voices' applies here.
<p>
[<i>I guess I didn't internalize this one.  I think it's sort of half true.  Certainly, you'll get along better if you don't take things personally and realize that everyone has their own reality and basis for saying what it is they say.  Every time someone says something to you that's startling or doesn't match your current picture of what's going on, before getting instantly furious, you need to realize that for whatever reason there's a huge discontinuity between what you see and need and what they do.  It's more helpful to address the discontinuity then to just get pissed off - although not necessarily easy.
<p>
This is why the mission statement is so helpful - not only my own personal one, but the band's.  If someone joins the band to be a fabulous soloist, and then I don't make the person first chair right away and they get all pissy on me, I can point to the band's mission statement and say 'Your need doesn't match the band's mission, and in case of a conflict, I have to go back to this.'  The person can then adjust, or leave.</i>

<h2>Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions</h2>
<h4>Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama</h4>
<p>
<i>From my journal, 5/14/2002</i>: Absolutely.  I pretty much already do this one.  I use words to analyze and dissect.  On the other hand, I do make assumptions.  I think you <u>have</U> to just to get through the day.  [<i>Otherwise, you'd paralysed.</i>]  But you must always be prepared for your assumptions to be wrong.
<p>
<i>From my journal, an added comment</i>: Be cognizant of when you are making assumptions and flag them for reality checks.</i>
<hr>
<h2>Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best</h2>
<h4>Your best is going to change from moment to moment - it will be different whe you are healthy or sick or stressed or relaxed.  Under any circumstances, simply do your best and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.</h4>
<p>
[<i>Self Abuse.  Heh.  Heh-heh.  Heh-heh-heh.</i>] 
<p>
<i>From my journal, 5/14/2002</i>: I have never heard it put that way before.  Do your best at the time - what more can be asked?  Also realize that the best thing to do at a given moment may be to put it off.
<p>
Review ways in which you can do better.
<p>
[<i>This one I have internalized.  It goes hand in hand with two other thoughts that I've picked up on this journey: "What have you done today that you can be proud of?" and "The key to self-esteem is to do good things and remember you did them."  Your best definitely changes from day to day.  A habit I remember from my horn playing days is you have some days where everything works beautifully and you play at the top of your game, and other days where that doesn't happen.  You internalize the great day as "normal" and think you have a problem on the other day.  But it's not normal - it's the high end of a curve.  
<p>
I'm also a firm believer in the thought that yes, you can always do more than you are doing, but if you run an engine in the red all the time, the engine will burn out.  SO probably thinks of this as "lazy".</i>]
