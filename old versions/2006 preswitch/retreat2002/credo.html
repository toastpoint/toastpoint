<h1>Day 1 - Developing a Credo</h1>
<h2>The <a name="process">Process</a></h1>
The process was ad hoc, but pretty much did the trick.  I never did formalize my credo completely - 
that may happen as I write this!  If I do, I'll put that on a separate page.
<p>
First of all, the idea of writing a Credo ("I believe...") was presented to me as part of a playwriting class 
at <a href=http://www.wm.edu>William and Mary</a> taught by Louis Catron.  The class was great, but I didn't do very 
well in it - not only because I'm no playwright, but because I never did actually sit down and write the damn 
credo.  But I loved the idea of it.  If you can nail down what you believe in and what's important to you, 
you can then figure out what to do about it.  And isn't it interesting that we can't just reel off this 
sort of thing off the top of our heads?
<p>
One subject that needs to be addressed in everyone's Credo is one's belief or lack thereof in a deity or deities.  
I was not raised religious and my parents are active secular humanists.  I suspected I could be a humanist in the 
making, so one thing I did is ask Dad to supply me with some "Humanism 101" type texts.  My (admittedly not very deep) 
consideration of humanism is below.
<p>
I also asked for some quick advice from a psychiatrist friend of mine for some literature to use on a self-guided retreat.  
He dismissed most of that sort of literature as pop psychology, but did recommend don Miguel Ruiz's <a href=http://www.miguelruiz.com/books.htm>
The Four Agreements</a>.  So I read that before the retreat and decided I would seriously consider the four agreements as 
part of my credo day.
<p>
I also realized that although I had never studied philosophy, perhaps that was another teeny little field (<i>snort</i>) to 
investigate.  I vaguely considered that I might be a "stoic", and my father helpfully pointed me to the 
<a href=http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html>Enchiridion</a>
 - a collection of sayings of Epictetus, downloadable for free off the Net.
<p>
I then investigated the roles I play in my life.  I'm a firm believer that the roles that you accept determine your responsibilities and your appropriate behavior.
<p>
Finally, I just wrote down stuff "I knew I knew".

<h2>From My Journal: Tuesday, May 14th, 2002 </h2>

This is what I wrote... I'll put <i>asides and comments</i> in <i>italics</i>.
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
What do I believe?<p>
I believe that:
<ul>
<li>A person should use his gifts to the fullest possible.<p>
<li>Often using a gift to the fullest implies neglecting other gifts.  <br>
<i>(these two seem to contradict each other, don't they?)</i><p>
<li>A person is ultimately responsible for himself.  We are not woed anything once we are 
capable of sustaining ourselves.  Your responsibility then becomes to not be a burden on others.  If you allow 
others to support you in any way, it is still ultimately your responsibility.  
<p><li>
You also have any responsibility you take on by agreement.  Part of your responsibility to 
yourself is to keep yourself in a state of competency to honor the other responsibilities 
you have accepted.  If you cannot, you should pass the responsibility on to someone else.  <i>
What I meant here was you shouldn't just drop the responsibility, you should transfer it so you know that 
the responsibility is still being taken care of - just not by you.</i>  What may help you is to 
clearly define the boundaries of your responsibility.  It's very easy - and people will be glad to help you - 
to expand the limits of your responsibility.
<p><li>I believe that emotions are good and not to be squashed - but that you can choose not to act on them.  
I think that SO thinks I have no emotions, but maybe I don't respond to them.  <i>I'm using "SO" instead of the name of 
my significant other.</i>  On the other hand, I have frequently thought that I don't react 
sufficiently emotionally to events.  <i>Said the robot who uses such big words all the time...</i>  
Allow yourself to feel.  Allow yourself to hurt.  You are strong enough to heal from the hurt.
<p><li>
I strongly doubt that there is a judging God or that there is an afterlife.  However, I believe that 
living a good moreal life and using my gifts to the fullest are what I'm here to do and fulfilling 
my purpose will get me through the pearly gates.  :)  <i>Yes, I did write the f-ing smiley in the journal...</i>
<p><li>
Good is anything that enables you to grow without getting in the way of others.
<p><li>Good is improving others' lives as well as mine.
</ul>
<h3>From Life 101</h3>
McWilliams has three simple rules which I buy into, so I threw them in here, paraphrased:
<ul>
<li>Don't hurt yourself or others.
<p><li>Take care of yourself so you need as little help as possible, and so that you can help others.
<p><li>Use <em>everything</em> for your own personal growth.
</ul>

<h3>Responsibility</h3>
This question of responsibility keeps nagging me.  What am I responsible for?<p>
My own life and everything about it.<p>
Keeping my relationship with SO alive and fulfilling to both.  (this is his responsbility as well)  This includes: 
<ul><li>Establishing a mutually agreed-upon living arrangement and sticking to the agreement, or changing it when necessary.
<li>Investigating, proposing and managing opportunities for our growth together: culture, travel, seminars, exercise, special 
interest groups.  Parties.  Classes.
</ul>
As SO's partner, my job is also to cover for him in his life when he can no longer be responsible.

<h3>The Four Agreements</h3>
I then started exploring the first book I brought, The Four Agreements.  My thoughts on it are <a href=4agreements.html>here</a>.
<hr>
<h3>Humanism</h3>
After pondering the Four Agreements, I turned my attention to Humanism.  My thoughts on it are <a href=humanism.html>here</a>.
<hr>
<h3>Roles</h3>
I'm a huge believer that we play many roles in our life (thank you, Wm. Shakespeare) and your role in any given situation determines your responsibility and your behavior.  From my journal, my pontification about <a href=roles.html>roles is here</a>.
<hr>
(Theoretically, there should be a formal Credo somewhere in here... right now, it's like a junk drawer.)
