<h1>Humanism</h1></center>
Let me start with a disclaimer: <a href=http://afgen.com/humanism.html>Humanism</a> is an enormous subject.  My goal on the retreat was simply to explore the basic ideas and see whether the philosophy was a good fit for me.  My father lent me <i>The Philosophy of Humanism</i> by Corliss Lamont, which <a href=http://www.humanists.org/hum_lamont.htm>defines ten precepts of Secular Humanism</a>.
<p>
Below, I list the precepts and my reaction and thoughts to them.
<hr>
<h4>1. Humanism believes in a naturalistic metaphysics or attitude toward the universe that considers all forms of the supernatural as myth, and that regards Nature as the totality of being and as a constantly changing system of matter and energy which exists independently of any mind or consciousness.</h4>
I have not seen any evidence to disprove #1 and it makes sense to me that it is true.  However, I don't want to put my eggs in that [<i>one</i>] basket.  As I said before, even if the universe/world is the product of a conscious mind, it makes no difference to how we live our lives.
<p>
I believe that prayer and religious ritual can serve as attitude 'exercises' to prepare you for day-to-day living.   However, I also believe that some religious beliefs are a crutch and are not beneficial to living this life, except to make the individual feel better.
<hr>
<h4>2. Humanism, drawing especially upon the laws and facts of science, believes that homo sapiens is an evolutionary product of this great Nature of which we are a part; that our minds are indivisibly conjoined with the functioning of our brain; and that as an inseparable unity of body and personality, we can have no conscious survival after death.</h4>
Yes, I do believe this - although I may be wrong.  [<i>In other words, this jibes with my experience and makes logical sense.  But since I have no way of checking, I realize that it's still an assumption.  Certainly, it's 'nicer' to believe that it's not true - a seductive idea.</i>]
<hr>
<h4>3. Humanism, having its ultimate faith in humankind, believes that human beings possess the power or potentiality of solving their own problems, through reliance primarily upon reason and scientific method applied with courage and vision. </h4>
[<i>All I wrote here was</i>] Yes Yes Yes to this one.
<hr>
<h4>4. Humanism believes, in opposition to all theories of universal predestination, determinism, or fatalism, that human beings, while conditioned by the past, possess genuine freedom of creative choice and action, and are, within certain objective limits, the masters of their own destiny.</h4>
Yes, true.
<hr>
<h4>5. Humanism believes in an ethics or morality that grounds all human values in this-earthly experiences and relationships; one that holds as its highest goal the this-worldly happiness, freedom, and progress (economic, cultural, and ethical) of all humankind, irrespective of nation, race, or religion.</h4>
This is worthy of belief.  I may not be there yet.  [<i>A later comment:</i>] I personally belief that your personal responsibility gets less and less the further you go.  [<i>My point here was to say that, for instance, it would be more important to me to value the happiness and progress of the people within my sphere than ones I didn't know.  But now, I see that the inclusion of the words "highest goal" can be interpreted as, "The absolute basics here are that we want everyone to be happy and to grow as much as possible, thus furthering the human race's development and maturity".  I can put a big happy stamp on that idea.</i>]
<hr>
<h4>6. Humanism believes that the individual attains the <u>good</u> life by harmoniously combining personal satisfaction and continuous self-development with significant work and other activities that contribute to the welfare of the community.</h4>
This makes sense and goes hand-in-hand with the rules from Life 101.  Help yourself <i>and</i> help others.  Especially realizing that if you don't help yourself, you may not be <i>able</i> to help others.
<hr>
<h4>7. Humanism believes in cultivating the widest possible development of art and the awareness of beauty (including nature) so that the aestehtic experience may become a pervasive reality in the lives of men.</h4>
I like this one a lot.  I have a note to myself to look up "aesthetic" - one would think that as someone who knows <i>Patience</i> so well, I'd be able to rattle off a definition.  But basically, what this is saying is that everyone works to make everything as beautiful as possible, and works to make sure that people <i>note</i> the beauty around them, everyone's lives will be improved.
<hr>
<h4>8. A far-reaching social program that stands for the establishment of peace, democracy, and a high standard of living on the foundations of a flourishing economic order.</h4>
So, we have no war, we have a government for the people by the people, everyone is wealthy and everyone has jobs.  That sounds like something worth fighting for.
<hr>
<h4>9. A complete social implementation of reason and scientific method, democratic procedures, freedom of expression and civil liberties throughout all areas of life.</h4>
It has never been more clear to me that this is necessary.  With today's (2004) fights over gay marriage, the civil rights abuses perpetrated by our own country in Iraq and in Cuba, it is no longer enough to declare this, "duh, obvious".  It is clear that a large number of powerful people in this world have a vested interest in the above <i>not</i> being true - but the human race cannot mature except through reason and the acceptance of diversity.
<hr>
<h4>10. Humanism believes in unending questioning of basic assumptions and convictions, including its own.</h4>
Hurrah.  If you believe that something is true, you should never be afraid to question it.  If it's true, it will hold up.  If it's not (or not any more, even if it was true before), it's not worth holding on to.
<hr>
So we are put on earth to live our own lives to the fullest and to help mankind reach its potential through reason, prosperity and art.
