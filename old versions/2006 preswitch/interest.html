<a name="advice"><h3>Advice:</h3>
For advice on any subject, large or small, ask the erudite 
<A HREF="http://www.grandiose.com">Sir Charles Grandiose</A>.
<hr>

<a name="alma"><h3>Alma Maters:</h3>
<i>"Hark the students' voices swelling, strong and true and clear..."</I>  <br>
Visit the virtual sites of my bright college days: <a href=http://www.wm.edu/>The College of William and
Mary</a> and <a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">Peabody Conservatory</a>.
<hr></a>

<a name="friends"><h3>Friends and Family:</h3>
<ul>
<li>My parents are heavily involved in 
<a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/lowcountry/">The Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry</a>.  
<li>My sister works for the <a href=http://www.lgrl.org>Lesbian and Gay 
Rights Lobby of Texas</a> in Austin.
<li>
My old college roommate and HTML guru maintains the unusually rococo
<a href="http://www.grandiose.com/vance.html">Cul-de-Sac Briceland</a>.  
Very much worth visiting.  
<li>
I met the lovely and talented <a href=http://www.scherzo.com>Susan Poliniak</a> 
when we were in the chorus of <i>Carmen</i> together years ago in Philadelphia.  
Now we're both in New York, involved in Gilbert and Sullivan stuff, and she 
has her fingers in many pies, as you will see.
<li>
Pay a visit to 
<a href="http://www.reed.edu/~harlowe/">Esther's La-La Land</a>, the virtual reality
of my bouncy young friend who was such a delightful host to us 
in <a href=http://erique.home.netcom.com/sanfran97/bayarea.html>San Francisco</a>.
<li>
<a href="http://wanda.pond.com/~stevecap/Welcome.htm">Steven Capsuto</a>, 
media historian extraordinaire has a great page with all sorts of literary and library-ish links.
<li>
Miss <a href=http://members.aol.com/bluefairy/>Alan Lutton</a> is another friend of mine from 
various directions in Philadelphia, most notably two-stepping.
<li>
Steven, Alan and I were all sucked into the maw (twice!) of an all-male reading of Claire Booth's <em>The Women</em>.  
This project came from the mind of the infinitely twisted <a href=http://www.mindspring.com/~cconnelly>Chris Connelly</a>.  
As I told him once, as he was quoting huge chunks of lyrics from <em>Coco</em>, 
"The rest of us are just trying to be faggots.  You're already there."
<li>
They haven't updated their sites in ages, but my buddies 
<a href=http://keck.ucsf.edu/~holder>Gaylord Holder</a> and 
<a href=http://phy.ucsf.edu:80/~mare/>Marianne Lipson</a> (a spousal team) 
are bright and interesting persons,and have produced a little person named Campbell Hannegan 
Holder.  We got to 
<a href=http://erique.home.netcom.com/sanfran97/bayarea.html>visit them</a> 
in San Francisco 
over Memorial Day, 1997, but now they're back in Philadelphia, where I met them.)
<li>
Frequent <a href=fiction/fiction.html>Bad Fiction Contest</a> contributor 
Becky Mushko writes the <em>Peevish Advice</em> column for 
<a href=http://www.brtraditions.com>Blue Ridge Traditions</a> on-line magazine.  Check 
it out!
</ul>
<hr>
<a name="gay"><h3>Gay Stuff</h3>
If you're a ten-percenter, or 'just curious', check out the 
<a href="http://www.qrd.org/QRD/www/index.html">Queer Resources Directory</a>.  
I'm a <a href="http://www.resourcesforbears.com/">bear</a>-lover myself, although 
I've found bears don't measure up to Wumpuses.  
<hr>

<a name="gods"><h3>Gods and Goddesses</h3>
<b>Singer Gods</b> - Considering I'm a classically-trained singer and this man sings like 
a vegetable grater in pain, it's amazing that I love 
<a href=http://www.michaelmcdonald.com/>Michael McDonald</a>.  
And yet, strangely, I do.  Probably because he's such a hunka hunka burnin' love (and his music's cool, too!)<p>

<b>Singer Goddesses</b> - My Goddess of Love, the fabulous <A
HREF="http://www.christinelavin.com">Christine Lavin</a> will bring 
great happiness to your life.  
And so will the up-and-coming folkie who I actually <b><i>know!</i></b>, 
<a href=http://www.susanwerner.com>Susan Werner</a>.
<p>
<b>Actor Gods and Actress Goddesses</b> I used to have 
quite a few links here, but they all seem to be dead.  I'll have to 
do some splorin later and find some more...<hr>
<a name="gossip"><h3>Gossip</h3>
One of the most edifying collection of minds on the planet can be found discoursing in 
the newsgroup 
<a href=news:alt.showbiz.gossip>alt.showbiz.gossip</a>.  But for goshsake, read the 
<a href=http://people.delphi.com/nlopez/afaq.htm>Anti-FAQ</a> and lurk a while 
before you post, lest you 
(a) get flamed as YABWFTNOTN, (b) spell out the word <em>l______</em>, or (c) invoke the ASG curse.
<hr>
<a name="humor"><h3>Humor</h3>
I used to spend my working days in a corporate environment much like <a
href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert">Dilbert</a> has to
deal with.  Now I work for a <a href=http://www.merrillcorp.com>company 
he would adore.</a><p>
But those who know me know I play and collect musical instruments, so 
this page of 
<A href="http://www.mit.edu/people/jcb/jokes/">instrument jokes</A> 
holds a place near and dear to my heart.  Especially the soprano jokes.<p>
