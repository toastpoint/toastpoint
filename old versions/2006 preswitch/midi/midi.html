<h2>Original Musical Compositions by Toast Point!</h2>

You can be frightened now - I now not only possess a fabulous computer,
but a MIDI keyboard and a music notation program.  And I got inspired
to feed into the computer the <em>three</em> (count them, three!)
pieces I have actually <strong>composed</strong> myself.  (An aside - many people assume
that since I'm a musician, I'm a composer.  I'm <em>not</em>.  Have never had an
original musical thought in my life.)  But these MIDI files should let you decide for yourself.
<p>
The first work, for piano, is entitled <a href=3elephs.mid>Three Elephants Romping in the
Florida Everglades</a> and is a minuet written for a theory class in
college.  Since the rules of the exercise were fairly simple (use some
stepwise harmonic progressions, modulate to a not-completely-related key
in the middle), I got creative.  The title came from something Mr.
Bradley Staubes described me as once when I was crashing around our dorm
room freshman year.
<p>
The second, <a href=deusmeus.mid>Deus Meus</a> yadda yadda, is a four-part vocal setting of some
Latin text or other that I had to do for 16th century counterpoint in
grad school.  It's deathly dull and not very good even in its genre (I
think I got a B), but I fed it in because I'd never actually heard it
with all four voices going.  You won't hear the vibrant latin text, just
the notes.
<p>
The third, <a href=gross.mid>Gross Fugue</a>, was written for 18th century counterpoint class.  It’s quite a 
work and one of which I'm very
proud.  Although I'm not J.S. Bach (or any of his sons), give me solid
structural rules to follow and I'm pretty happy.  GF is a double fugue
for any 4 instruments (or organ or whatever). A double fugue means that:
<ol>
<li>
The first fugue subject is tossed in and all four voices get to play
it, each in turn.
<li>
The second fugue subject gets tossed in and the same thing happens.
<li>
Both fugue subjects happen <em>at the same time</em>!  Each of the subjects
gets assigned to a different voice, and the two voices left do, um,
something else.  This happens four times so that each voice gets a shot
at each fugue subject.  
</ol>
By this point, all pretense of melodic or harmonic interest has been
thrown out the window, because you're just trying to get everything to
work together. But I think it's really cool!
<p>
A newbie at MIDI, I haven't yet figured out how to assign voices to
different "instruments", so the vocal stuff sounds like voices, or the
elephants sound like tubas, or the fugue boys all sound different from
each other.  Maybe later.  

Your browser should be able to pull these MIDI files off automatically.  Just click on the underlined titles 
above.  Oh, you need a sound card or
some sort of sound system.  If you don't, or they don't work, don't
worry about it.
<p>
Enjoy!
