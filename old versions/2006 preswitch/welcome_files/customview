However, the summer between college and grad school, I worked a great temp job that allowed me to download games in BASIC from BBS's, including Adventure, and finally managed to at least find the pirate's chest.  (arrrrrr)<br /><br />(I also told Hippo about Drood and I modifying BASIC games to make them naughty, like making the boxing game into \"female mudwrestling\".)<br /><br />All of which is to say that that discussion caused me to flash back to another temp job I had the summer afterward.  It was just typing in WordPerfect for a professor at the U of MD med school in Baltimore, but I don't think I ever actually met the professor and there was very little work for me to do.  After a couple of days sitting around doing nothing, I brought in my disks of BASIC games and happily whiled away the days playing Yahtzee and Monopoly.<br /><br />This was in the days of monochrome monitors, which were usually white, green or amber text.  This one was amber, and I realized that I had picked up an unconscious habit - when my eyes got tired from the text, I would look away at something that wasn't that color.  I guess I'd been doing it for years, but what brought it to my attention was that the walls in that office were EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR as the text.  So my eyes would get tired, I'd unconsciously look away, and then go \"Aaaugh\" as my eyes got a BIG BLAST of the same color I was trying to avoid.  Heh.  I thought about bringing in a blue poster or something.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a great cushy job and they really liked me, and were actually looking for other opportunities there for me, but then another job I'd applied for came through, and I went with that.  That was at a law firm, and much less fun, but the deal was that I could go part-time once school started up again and that job proved to be a godsend for the second year of grad school.  <br /><br />It also made me realize that, in the world of office PCs, I could make a killing.  I knew next to nothing, but the people who needed my help knew NOTHING.  In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.  And thus was a career born.<br><hr size=\"1\"><font color=\"#ffa500\" size=\"2\">[2004/03/22 4:35 pm]</font><br>I think I've discovered <a href=\"http://www.teemings.com/extras/lotr/\">the solution</a> to LOTR stodgy writing.<br /><br /><tt>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single hobbit in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of an adventure. <br /><br />However little known the feelings or views of such a hobbit may be on his first receiving his inheritance, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of wandering wizards, that he is considered as the rightful recipient of one or the other of their magic rings. <br /><br />“My dear Mr. Sackville-Baggins,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Bag End is vacant at last?” <br /><br />Mr. Sackville-Baggins replied that he had not. <br /></tt><br /><hr><br /><tt>RECIT. -- GANDALF <br /><br />Gentlemen, I pray you tell me<br />Where a gentle hobbit dwelleth, named Frodo,<br />The ward of Bilbo?<br />In pity speak, oh speak, I pray you! <br /><br />TED SANDYMAN.

None of this will be particularly insightful to anyone.<br /><br />I recently friended (and was friended back by) <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=griffen'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/griffen/'><b>griffen</b></a></span>, whose journal I discovered just through a <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=metaquotes'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif' alt='[info]' width='16' height='16' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/community/metaquotes/'><b>metaquotes</b></a></span> post and I thought he was hot. :) Following his journey, even just through the last few days, has been fascinating.<br /><br />My first \"rush of lust\" happened when I was 12, and I instantly realized I was gay (and was horrified).  It was immediately clear to me that these feelings were not coming from any of the personality traits that caused my ever-so-sensitive classmates to call me a fag (bad at gym, book reader, etc. etc) - they just plunked in out of the blue and must be hardwired in there somewhere.<br /><br />Part of coming to terms with it was realizing that being gay didn't mean I had to become a flaming queen, or a cross-dresser, or for that matter a lumberjack - I could do any of these if I wanted to, but it wouldn't make me MORE gay or less gay.  And that translated to my \"manhood\" as well.  By the time I got this sorted out, I was a (full-grown) man - and I wasn't going to be more or less of a man just by dressing a certain way or being top or bottom or whatever.  Quite freeing.<br /><br />But my own gender identity has never been in doubt.  There's no question that there were many \"man things\" I had no interest in (football, hunting, being a testosterone-crazed jerk), but I never felt like I wanted to be a woman.  I always felt like a boy - my own kind of boy, to be sure - but never a girl.  Even the girly things I liked felt like, \"yeah, this is girly, but I like them anyway, and that doesn't make me a girl.\"  And yeah, I wanted to have sex with men, but I wanted to be a man having sex with men.<br /><br />I guess the point I'm trying to make is that gender identity is probably as hard-wired as sexual orientation, and if it's pointing in the \"wrong\" direction, it's still going to be better for you as a person to deal with it than suppress it.  But the two really are independent of each other.  I'm just lucky because I only had to deal with one of the two being \"abnormal\".<br><hr size=\"1\"><font color=\"#ffa500\" size=\"2\">[2004/03/20 7:49 am]</font><br>We saw <i>42nd St.</i> last night!  A minor miracle because the first time it was on Broadway (not that long ago), Mr. Man had to see it a zillion times because when his country relatives came to town, that's all they wanted to see.  So he had no desire to see it.  I had never seen it, but I'd played in the orchestra for a production once and it had been one of the most rewarding pit experiences I'd ever had.  So I whined and begged and Mr. Man finally broke down and got us tickets.  (now I have to get him past his similar aversion to <i>Fiddler</i>)<br /><br />It was great!  We had terrific seats, right on the aisle, halfway up.  This late in the run, no one in the cast was famous, but they were all good.  Well, I though Julian Marsh was too young, but everyone else was fine and the woman playing Dorothy was a hoot and a half.  But it reminded me how COOL tap-dancing is, and I don't think I've seen a tap show since <i>Bring in 'da Noise</i> - a show that I had no interest in seeing, and then fell for completely once I saw it.<br /><br />Now, of course, I think <i>every</i> show should have tap-dancing!<br /><br />SWEENEY: And I will get him back even as he gloats/ in the meantime I'll practice on less honorable throats! <i>tappatappatappatappa wings wings wings</i><br /><br />Personally, I love to dance, even though I look like one of those Fantasia hippos when I try.  I am hopelessly graceless, but since part of dance is musical - do <i>this</i> on that beat, I'm really good at that part.  So I may look absurd, but at least I'm always in the right spot at the right time.  I took a year of jazz when I was a teenager, have performed embarrassing solo dances in several stage shows (gay bar scene in <i>Applause</i>, the \"villain's dance\" in <i>Showboat</i>, and my personal favorite, the dancing leper in <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> and no, I'm not kidding) and of course, two-stepping, which I still miss even though I haven't been in ten years.<br /><br /><i>puts tap lessons on list of things to do A.B. - 'after band'</i><br><hr size=\"1\"><font color=\"#ffa500\" size=\"2\">[2004/03/18 10:33 am]</font><br>I'm doing my part to support the writing community.<br /><br />1) Just finished <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=katiemacalister'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/katiemacalister/'><b>katiemacalister</b></a></span>'s <i>The Year My Life Went Down the Loo</i>.<br /><br />2) Now have purchased and am reading the sequel, <i>They Wear <b>What</b> Under Their Kilts?</i>, which is a hoot.  <br /><br />(Katie, I have a picture on my desk of me and Mr. Man at Castle Urquhart, taken late August 2001.)<br /><br />3) Also purchased her <i>Men in Kilts</i> and <i>Improper English</i> - a theme, here?  <br /><br />4) Another copy of <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=drood'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/drood/'><b>drood</b></a></span>'s <i>Are You Being Cursed?</i> to hand off to Bunthorne Boy.<br /><br />5) And <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0689869584/qid=1079623944/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-1175121-4181423?v=glance&amp;s=books\">The True Meaning of Cleavage</a> by Mariah Fredericks, who's my upstairs neighbor.<br /><br />The logical next step would be to purchase <i>Power, Terror, Peace, and War : America's Grand Strategy in a World at Risk</i> by my <b>downstairs</b> neighbor, Walter Russell Mead.

Is that something that you worry about when you write your stories?<br /><br />I know in the HP fanfic universe, I tend to enjoy stories more if they read like they could have been written by JK Rowling.  Those tend to be whimsical and funny in the way Rowling writes.  However, I also enjoy many HP fanfics that have a totally different style - I'm thinking especially about the angsty dark ones.  <br /><br />I'm rereading the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I'm constantly struck by how stodgy the writing seems to be me.  (<i>Stan is instantly stoned by a bazillion LOTR fans.</i>)  No, really, slogging through Tolkein's narrative and dialog is a real chore for me, and it wouldn't be worth it if the story itself weren't so terrific.  So, of course, I'd like to check out some of the LOTR fanfic, but have no intention of wading through more ponderous narrative.<br /><br />OTOH, I can see why LOTR, perhaps more than other fandoms, would instantly generate slashy fiction.  There's enough male bonding in it to ... well, to do something.  I'm on <i>Return of the King</i> now, and jeez, Pippin and Beregond have a PICNIC together on the walls of Minas Tirith.  It's only a short step to dinner by candlelight.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br><hr size=\"1\"><font color=\"#ffa500\" size=\"2\">[2004/03/10 9:49 am]</font><br>Mr. Man and I have been having the most delightful domestique life recently.

I worked from home yesterday and was there when he came through the door.  He saw me and immediately started blahblahblahwork stuff.  I followed him around as he took off his backpack, put away his coat, changed clothes, made a drink, putzed around and continued a monologue that went for maybe a half an hour.

Closest for me as <a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/stanharding/2003/03/05/\">March 5th, 2003</a>, with my list of Celebrities I Have Actually Seen with My Own Two Eyes since moving to NYC.  Whee!  Which reminds me, I saw Kristen Johnson in my gym last week.  She is very tall, and glared at me every time I <s>stared</s> tried to really ascertain it was her.  I should have invited her to my Oscar party, I'll bet she could have shared some great dish.<br /><br />Band was bizarro last night, but I got some frustration off my chest afterward.  This has been the season where I make artistic decisions for the good of the organization that involves a particular person not getting what they want Oh So Deeply.  And that person gets all pissy and leaves in a huff.  This has happened, like, four times now.  After much soul-searching, I am quite certain that the decisions I've been making have been correct, but (a) I don't like making people unhappy, and would give them what they wanted if I could, and (b) grow the fuck up, already, people!  <br /><br />Particularly traumatizing was the phone call I had with a band alum who's a good friend - I lived with her for a week when I moved to town, but she's since moved and hasn't been in the band for years.  She was all set to come up and play the 25th anniversary concert, but I had to tell her no, she actually couldn't play the concert because we weren't actually inviting alumni to play, just to be there, and the section she would have joined is already too heavy.  She was completely torn up about this.  Again, (a) I'm so sorry, but no, and (b) why is this Such a Big Deal?<br /><br />And yes, I <u>do</u> know what it's like to want to be part of an event or performance or audition for a role or a spot and not to get it.
