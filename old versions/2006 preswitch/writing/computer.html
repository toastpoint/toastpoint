<h2>COMPUTERS MADE ME SMARTER - INSUFFERABLE, TOO</h2>
<p>
<h5><strong>Welcomat</strong> - February 14, 1990</h5>

<p>     My father is constantly sending me clippings from various
periodicals that I might find interesting.  I've gotten
everything from articles on AIDS to Roz Chast cartoons, and most
recently, an job-related article out of the Washington Post
Sunday supplement. The subject of the article was a new problem
that was being discussed among psychologists - the frustration
experienced in dealing with the real world by people who work
with computers all day long.  Not only do we get upset in traffic
jams and other life-delaying situations, but just talking to
"normal" people who skitter around a subject before getting to
the point can get us antsy and make us wish we could upgrade
their software to make them a little more user-friendly.
<p>     The accuracy of the article amazed me, because over the
years working in the computer field, I have noticed my own
thought processes becoming more "logical" - that is, more able to
sort out unnecessary bits of information, organize information
before presenting it, and make decisions based on whatever data
is relevant.  A computer is most effective when the person giving
it commands is presenting information in the way the system is
designed to receive it.  This means that the operator has to sort
the data all out in his brain before entering it.  Doing this day
in and day out, certain thought processes are reinforced (the
work gets done faster and more easily) and the operator actually
learns to think in a more ordered fashion.
<p>     But the new way of thinking that we learn doesn't go away
when we leave the office.  I find when I go to McDonald's, I
spend the time in line organizing my data (or "order" to the
layman), and delivering all the necessary information at once -
"Quarter pounder, medium fries, large Coke to go."  This
compulsion is strong enough that even if there is no line, I will
hang back and sort out what I want before going up to the
cashier, rather than going up and saying, "Um, I think I'll
have...no, wait, I'll have the..."  This causes two problems -
first, normal people who don't work with computers don't have the
day-to-day need to present information in an orderly fashion, so
they have no problem with going up to the counter and making up
their minds as they talk, and we "structured thinkers" get
frustrated and think they're stupid.  The other problem is that
since the McDonald's employees aren't computers, they're not
prepared to receive the information as we present it - in other
words, the girl behind the counter will ask me two minutes after
I place my order whether it's for here or to go, when I very
clearly stated at the end of my order what I wanted.  I mean, how
dare they!  Any self-respecting computer would have held that
information in memory until it needed it!  Unless we obsessed
types monitor our own behavior, we actually get angry at both the
undecided customer and the employee with the faulty memory, which
gets our blood pressure up and (if we actually display our
frustration) gets the other person thinking, "What a jerk!".   
<p>     The funny thing about this is that it feels GOOD to be
thinking in this orderly fashion.  You actually do feel that
you're thinking faster and more efficiently.  I personally have
found that the ability to sort out irrelevant or false bits of
information have made me a better arguer (something I've never
been good at).  But considering the problems it can cause in
ordinary life - well, hey.  Unless you realize what is going on
and watch yourself, you end up not being able to talk to anyone
unless they're a computer nerd, or a robot, and there goes your
social life.  It can even ruin your job, which is what caused you
to think like an automaton in the first place.  
<p>     I've worked for the last two years in the field of computer
customer support, which means I help people with computer
problems.  And most people who use computers professionally are
not computer people per se; they're just average joes who have to
enter data of some sort into a spreadsheet, or database, or a
secretary who has to use a word processing program.  Most of them
don't "get into" computers the way we nerds do, and don't develop
this weird mindset, so if we try to get information out of them,
or they're trying to tell us something, WE have to do the
information sorting.  Often I have dreamed of a client who would
call with a problem and present it the way I order hamburgers -
"I was in WordPerfect and I used List Files to print a file on
the laser printer and the printer didn't do anything".  That's
perfect - clear, concise, a lot of relevant and necessary
information.  But most of the time a client will give you this -
"I came back from lunch and my boss wanted three copies of this
complaint for the Newman case, and the complaint's twenty pages
long and has three signature lines and then my husband called and
I finally did that thing, you know, with the file list, and it
didn't work".  
<p>     Now, in order to help the user with her problem, we have to
get her to be more specific - "What 'thing' with the file list?",
for instance.  Or more important, what is meant by "didn't
work" - did the printer sit there happily doing nothing, or was
it frantically trying to do something and smoke was coming out of
the housing?   Meanwhile, she is getting more and more upset,
because her boss is screaming at her to get the thing printed,
and she thinks she screwed up somehow and is going to get fired,
and she's getting more and more incoherent, and can't understand
why you can't just wave a wand and fix it.   After a whole day of
this, the customer support representative gets a little cranky,
starts snapping at the users - "Turn the printer ON, you
batbrain!" - and shortly thereafter gets fired.
<p>     This is probably why most people who are new to computers
think they're never going to understand them and quite possibly
end up hating them.  First of all, the computer demands that they
think in a new way, and while they're learning, they're turning
for help to people who already think that way, and get frustrated
by people who think the OLD way.  "Computer people don't speak
English", the users complain, and "user" becomes a synonym for
"idiot" among the computer gentry.
<p>     What the solution is, I don't know.  I've been monitoring
myself and try not to get upset unless the situation calls for
it.  Once you realize that the skill of sorting and organizing
mental information is useful at certain times and an actual
handicap at others, you can just hold your tongue when you get
upset.  And then, later, having beers with your logical peers,
just say, "Oh, you haven't heard THIS one yet..."
