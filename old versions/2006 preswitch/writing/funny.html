<h2>WHAT'S SO FUNNY?</h2 align=middle>
<p>
<h5><strong>Welcomat -  September 2, 1992</strong></h5>
<p>
     I love stand-up comedy.  Getting cable TV was worth every
penny once I discovered that there's a whole channel dedicated to
comedy, and you can usually catch stand-up late at night on one
channel or other.  But I really lucked into a gold mine last
year - the Funny Bone comedy club on South Street.  A show at the
Funny Bone consists of three comedians - a master of ceremonies,
who's usually some kid just starting out, the "featured"
comedian, who's traveled the local circuit a few times and is
probably pretty good, and the "headliner", who is the one you
will see on TV specials.  Sometimes the featured comedian is
better than the headliner, but usually the quality gets better as
the evening goes along.  Plus they give out parties with reduced
cover charges, and if you play your cards right, you can win
these parties every month or so.  I've now been to the club many
times, and had an enjoyable evening every time.
<p>     Which was sort of a surprise, because one popular style of
comedy is to be abusive to various and sundry groups (including
the audience).  Nowadays, only Don Rickles could get away with
seriously insulting racial minorities, but it's still socially
acceptable to trash gay people, and as a gay man, I fully
expected to at some point run up against a homophobic comedian
and get insulted.  I was ready for that to happen, but, surprise,
it never did.  Party after party, I went and saw dozens of
comedians, all professing to be straight, some of whom were
audience-abusive, but none of whom aimed for the homophobic
audience.  I invited my gay friends to the parties - we all had
fun.  Clearly, the Eddie Murphy/Sam Kinison school of homophobic
comedy was not in style any more.
<p>     One memorable evening recently, I brought five other gay
men
with me to the club.  Halfway through the headliner's act, the
comedian started talking about a time when some gay guy tried to
pick him up.  We all tensed, wondering where this was going.  He
then asked, not expecting to get a response, "Any gay guys in the
audience?".  Our whole table clapped and cheered.  Surprised, he
said, "Really?".  We laughed and nodded (while the table of
Marines behind us got very silent).  The comedian went on to make
a series of jokes that explored the humor of the differences
between gay men and straight men, mostly about how straight men
were so afraid of being perceived as gay.  He was a riot, we were
laughing hysterically, and the tension passed.  Afterward, my
friend John confessed that he had been worried about the
comedians being homophobic, but this guy managed to pull off his
gay jokes without being offensive, and more importantly, making
everyone, gay and straight, enjoy the humor of the situation.
<p>     Well, to my last party, I once again invited John, plus a
few other people, mostly gay.  The MC was adequate, and the
featured player was really funny.  Well, the headliner - Percy
Crews II, remember that name - got up there, did about ten
minutes of comedy and launched into a gay stereotype of the Damon
Wayons "Men on ..." school.  This wasn't funny, but he wasn't
offensive until he finished off with "Gay people, can't live with
em..." and stopped there.  He went on in that vein for a few
minutes, going way beyond the boundaries of taste.  Well, I was
mad, but mostly felt awful about my friends, since I had
unwittingly brought them here to be insulted.  And sure enough,
John walked out - discreetly and politely, but he left.  The
remaining party stuck it out and the guy finished his gay-bashing
and went on.  But we weren't inclined to find him funny any more
and we left before the act was over.
<p>     The night left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.  A
lot of hopes and wide-eyed optimism dashed.  I had never left the
Funny Bone pissed off before.  I had sworn up and down that I'd
never seen a homophobic comedian there (and I hadn't, until that
night).  I invited friends to this party, not promising anything,
but certainly with an implication that they would be entertained
rather than upset.  My hope that homophobia was pass‚ was dead -
to be sure, the audience wasn't overly positive in their clapping
and laughing, but what I should have seen (and didn't) was a
still silence and a disapproving "oooo" as soon as he got really
offensive.  Some people would probably raise the fact that the
offensive comedian was black, and certainly there's a history of
black homophobic comedians - as mentioned before, Eddie Murphy
and Damon Wayons, and now this guy.  But I must say that the
previous guy (the one with the funny unoffensive jokes) was also
black.
<p>     I find it really disturbing that a black man can be
prejudiced against gay people, or that any minority that has been
discriminated against can discriminate against another.  I've
seen it in the gay community and I don't like it, and I've seen
it in other communities and it doesn't make any sense.  But the
thought of this person on stage night after night fostering
ignorance and prejudice under the guise of entertainment makes me
sick.  Admittedly, with some comedians, you go knowing you'll be
abused, but you can tell when it's serious and when it's not. 
Judy Tenuta doesn't really expect her "pigs" to "worship her",
which makes her abuse much more funny.  But this Crews guy was
obviously serious.
<p>     A note to everyone who went to the Funny Bone that week -
the stereotypical gay man Crews presented does exist, but most of
us don't fit that stereotype.  And we don't deserve that sort of
treatment.  A note to the Funny Bone - I'll still patronize your
establishment, because your record has been good up til now, but
I'll never pay to see that guy again.  And if you bring in anyone
else like that, you're going to get bitched at.  A note to any
other gay people who were in that audience - we all wimped out
when we should have stopped him right in his tracks, and we all
share the blame for that.  And a note to Percy Crews II - you're
a lousy comedian, an asshole besides, and your hatemongering and
fagbashing has no place in a country with tensions, racial and
otherwise, as high as they are now.  Good comedy is funny to
everyone.
