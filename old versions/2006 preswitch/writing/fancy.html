<H2>FANCY DANCING</H2>
<p>
<h5><strong>Philadelphia City Paper</strong> - June 2-9, 1989</h5>
<p>     I started a new job a month or so ago - working as a
contractor for a large government agency downtown.  I was pleased
to discover someone had established a "Book Swap" in our floor's
lunchroom - a bookcase filled with books which you could take for
free, with the idea that you would replace them with your
unwanted books.  Giving me access to a resource like this is like
letting a kid loose in a candy store, and I never failed to least
take a glance at the selection every time I was in there.
<p>     One day, passing by, I took a quick look and what should be
sitting face up on one of the shelves, begging someone to take
it, but Patricia Nell Warren's The Fancy Dancer.  My heart
racing, I looked around to see if anyone was watching, grabbed
the book and quickly raced back to my desk to hide the book in my
briefcase.
<p>     This paranoid behavior deserves a bit of explanation.  When
I was twelve, my libido flicked on as if someone had hit a
switch - at which point I found out to my chagrin that those
creeps who called me "faggot" in gym class were right.  From the
attitudes of my peers, and from what I had gathered from the
world around me, I had every reason to expect that being gay
meant lifelong harassment, taunting and ostracism, and (worse) -
no one would like me any more.  I had no religious objections to
being gay, just the usual fear of rejection by family and
society, plus the scientific view of the brainy eighth-grader -
thoughts were running through my head like "biologically,
homosexuality makes NO SENSE AT ALL!"  
<p>     Well, I spent the next eight years of my life ignoring the
insistent demands of my libido ("Eric, look!  Over there!  Man
with moustache!  Go for it!"), trumping up the slightest sign I
might be straight ("That girl looks kinda cute - hooray, I'm
normal!"), and reading every gay book I could get my hands on. 
Having older bohemian friends, I did get my friends on The Joy of
Gay Sex and I'm amazed that I continued to delude myself after my
reactions to that book.  But one of my more exciting adventures
was checking out The Fancy Dancer from the library when I was
fourteen.
<p>     Funny how I've never seen that book in hardback - it's
always been a tattered paperback on the library shelves, looking
like no one in his right mind would want to read this sleazy book
(then why is it so tattered, you may ask?)  The Fancy Dancer is
the story of a young priest in a small Montana town (who just
happens to be incredibly handsome and well-built) being "brought
out" by a gay tough-guy biker.  The cover looks like an all-male
Harlequin romance - macho brooding stud in leather jacket; and
behind him, looking pensive, handsome blond priest.  
<p>     Watching to see if anyone saw me , I quickly grabbed the
book (sound familiar?), put it in the middle of my stack of books
so the librarian wouldn't ask me about it (those librarians, you
know, not only know the contents of every book they deal with,
they are also the guardians of public morals) and managed to get
the book checked out without getting arrested.  Then of course, I
had to hope my parents wouldn't rummage through my library books
and jump to (correct) conclusions.
<p>     Reading that book was quite an experience - it really is a
gay romance novel and affected me the same way those Harlequins
do the female adolescent.  I must have read it four times in the
two weeks I had.  I returned it to the library with regret, but
when a few months later, I noticed the same tattered copy in the
"For Sale" pile, I didn't have the guts to buy it.
<p>     Well, here it is, ten years later, and I discover a piece
of
my history in the vending machine room.  I've been out of the
closet for three years, actively involved in the gay community,
and open with all my friends and loved ones.  My parents have
been wonderful - my only sibling is also gay and their open-
mindedness has been stretched to the limits, but they've handled
it well.
<p>     And, goddammit, I've found out that "Gay Pride" means being
proud of accepting yourself and handling your life in a culture
that disapproves of what you are.  So why should I still be
nervous about being seen in public with a gay gothic romance? 
The truth is that three years of self-education, support groups
and discussion aren't going to erase the formative influence of a
culture that teaches that homosexuality is bad, and until that
guilt is purged, I'm still going to keep my eyes open for whoever
is watching.
