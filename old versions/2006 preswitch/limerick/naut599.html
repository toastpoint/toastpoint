That horny old Jedi, Darth Vader<br>
Had foreskin as rough as a gator - <br>
Princess Leia said "No,<br>
That thing's got to go!"<br>
But the force was with him, so he ate her!

Fucked the bum of little Alice,<br>

Do HER at Buckingham Palace!

Chu Chullain to dare<br>
Where she succumbed to his big Gae Bolga..
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It's better to be a poor poet than to be none at all!"</i>
<p>Suzie dallied first one then another.<br>
She confided the deeds to her brother.<br>
When all's said and done<br>
She gave birth to a son<br>
And her brother'd made Suzie a mother.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "99% of lawyers give the rest a bad name!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Mamasan writes 05/21/99</h3>
A comely young aide name Lewinsky<br>
Blew more men than Kazinsky<br>
With her little blue dress<br>
She cleaned up the mess<br>
And with the hem she wiped off her chinski!

<p>
There was an old woman from Pismo<br>
Who invented a wonderful gizmo<br>
That caused men of large girth<br>
To orbit the earth<br>
Now there's always full moons over Pismo!

<hr>
<h3>Bozo writes 05/21/99</h3>
Visiting his girl friend who lived in Salina<br>
He stuck his cock straight up her vagina<br>
With his oversize dong<br>
Fucked all night long<br>
And then died of an attack of angina.

<i>The poet comments, "What a way to go!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Coolscribbler writes 05/21/99</h3>
There was an old lady down the road<br>
Who liked to have sex with  a toad.<br>
Says I to her "fine"<br>
But doesn't he taste of slime?<br>
Maybe, but he has a big load!


<hr>
<h3>Friar writes 05/17/99</h3>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
At a zoo, squeezed the balls, did Miss Snatcham<br>
Of a well hung giraffe (what can match ‘em?)<br>
As he bolted the fence<br>
Said the zoo keeper – Spence<br>
“Please squeeze mine dear, so that I can catch him!”

<hr>
<h3>Arlen shares a classic 05/15/99</h3>

Who had a particular feeling<br>
She laid on her back<br>
And played with her crack<br>
Then pissed all over the ceiling.

Who was flattering and pretty<br>
But all the men who fell<br>
Found her to be male<br>
And departed with much pity.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bate@together.net>B8</a> writes 05/12/99</h3>

Instead of just blowing, she'd toot.

<hr>
<h3>Jeebs68 shares a classic 05/11/99</h3>

The crossed legs of my wife cause vexation.<br>
So my member demands masturbation.<br>
Man, it's hard to believe,<br>
That her labial cleve,<br>
Is responsible for such frustration!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Where do I get my ideas?  Experience!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Bakai writes 05/08/99</h3>
Sometimes I just look at my shlong<br>
And think of the lovers it's wronged<br>
It no longer inspires<br>
Any selfish desires<br>
It just hangs there and sings its sad song.

<p>The girls in the street leave me be<br>
But it's not cause I'm lacking their fee<br>
Nope, word's got around<br>
that I'm somewhat unsound<br>
And, rather than cum, I just pee!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ah, the depths that we plumb for a rhyme."</i>
<p>My buddy is wildly in thrall<br>
With a lady who's really quite tall<br>
When she asks for some head<br>
He gets out of their bed<br>
And does his good deed in the hall!

<p><img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The snatch of a waitress named Pips<br>
Bottomed out just an inch past the lips<br>
Though her muff was not deep<br>
She cried nary a peep<br>
'Cause she made a good living on tips!

<p>My girlfriend has rings and the lot<br>
Adorning the folds of her twat<br>
My tool, once quite hard<br>
Is now wimpy and scarred<br>
I guess a gold digger I'm not

<p><img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
My gal, in a rare pious mood<br>
Shaved her pubes, then had it tattooed<br>
Now, while I'm down south<br>
Making joy with my mouth<br>
My nose rubs the ass of St. Jude!

<hr>
<h3>Bakai writes 05/07/99</h3>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Perhaps my dear mama was right<br>
"You'll go blind whacking off in the night!"<br>
I beat it for years<br>
Spewing spunk past my ears<br>
Now, to find it, I need lots of light!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:eva_amata@hotmail.com>Eva Amata</a> writes 05/07/99</h3>
You couldn’t remember its name<br>
As you played your linguistical game<br>
But I didn’t get cross<br>
‘Cos I knew that it was<br>
On the tip of your tongue as I came!

<hr>
<h3>Shagnasty McFilth writes 05/05/99</h3>
Reno to Clinton, "Bill, do not linger,<br>
Just reach over and pull my finger.<br>
My cheeks will part<br>
With a thunderous fart<br>
And you'll enjoy a real wing dinger!"
<hr>
<h3>H writes 5/4</h3>
<h4>The Xaist Saga</h4>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A populous species, the Xaist,<br>
Just float around, orb-like, in space.<br>
Their bods have one hole<br>
With many a role -<br>
Known functions: sex, smelling and waste.
<p>
Now, no one knew how to deduce<br>Just how all these Xaist reproduce.<br>
But this, though, we knew:<br>
The farts that they blew<br>
Were complex, diverse, and effuse.
<p>
Along with some spores, small and round,<br>
It’s known that, included, is sound.<br>
The theory goes so:<br>
They preggers their beau<br>
With stinky sweet tunes. How profound!
<p>
Unsure how Xaist generate germ<br>
(And what we know’s smoke more than sperm),<br>
Our word-smiths were stuck -<br>
‘Twas not quite a fuck,<br>
So “fmoke”’s exobio’s new term.
<p>
Now add to this mystery *this* thing:<br>
The male of this species was missing.<br>
Although we’d found “spore<br>
Of fmoke”, nothing more.<br>
The riddle, in whole, was quite pissing.
<p>
Now once when I happened to pass<br>
An intergalactic gas-mass,<br>
My sensors played scales<br>
Like those of Earth-whales<br>
But timbred like woodwinds and brass.
<p>
A Xaist-orb was spotted to port.<br>
It turned, and began to distort.<br>
First it grew wavy,<br>
Emitting some “gravy”,<br>
And then it grew flattened and short.
<p>
Its tiny tight hole, but a blip,<br>
Then opened and let something rip.<br>
The space-phones recorded<br>
A dissonance sordid.<br>
Now, had it just fmoked with my ship?
<p>
Then there in the void we beheld<br>
No Xaist. Had it also propelled<br>
Itself into warp?<br>
A brief stench of carp<br>
Was all that the gas sensors smelled.
<p>
We scanned the whole quadrant for queer E, us,<br>
And tracked a fresh wormhole to Sirius<br>
And as we warped off<br>
I called for a boff<br>
And soon had Lieutenant delerious.
<p>
Excited by ventures anew,<br>
I gave a short break to the crew<br>
(Them horny-assed fuckers<br>
Can shure shoot some Smuckers™),<br>
And soon they were sticky with spew.
<p>
Now back to the story at hand -<br>
(Lieutenant, please stow my fine gland)<br>
From warp-speed we jumped,<br>
And wow, were we pumped!<br>
A zillion fine Xaist! The home-land!
<p>
The Star of the Dog, bright and bold,<br>
Illumined Xaist secrets untold!<br>
The musical gas<br>
From Xaist ass to ass -<br>
A beautiful web to behold!
<p>
We quietly lurked for awhile<br>
And shook our heads slow with a smile,<br>
For once we’d translated<br>
The farts generated,<br>
The words weren’t all Lesbian style!
<p>
We found that in throes of desire<br>
One partner, the one who got higher,<br>
Would briefly turn male<br>
And thus ends my tale.<br>
Yes, where there is fmoke there’s a sire.

<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
You are in a bit of a bind;<br>
Maybe just out of your mind.<br>
I'm now here to tell ya'<br>
You misguided fella,<br>
STOP IT or else you will go blind.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
As I go on year after year,<br>
My mind decays further, I fear.<br>
More often these days,<br>
I stand in a haze,<br>
Thinking "What was I doing in here?"<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
We hear quite a lot about teachers<br>
Fondling kids 'neath the bleachers.<br>
But the truth around here,<br>
Catch a pedophile queer,<br>
Nine times out of ten, it's a preacher.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
We've had three in the past couple years,<br>
Respected theological queers.<br>
When they're hauled into court,<br>
They're the sorriest sort,<br>
As they plead mental illness in tears.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
There once was an eloquent faker,<br>
That inbred throwback, Jim Bakker.<br>
He's a cocksucking faggot!<br>
And what about Swaggart!<br>
The nude hooker photograph taker.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
No Jesus freak people inane<br>
Will ever put me to shame.<br>
The Christians I see<br>
Are perverted as me,<br>
So I feel I'm ahead of the game.<br>
<p>

<h4>from Al Willis </h4>
"I masticate three times a day."<br>
Mrs. Malprop entered the fray.<br>
She said, "It is sin.<br>
I am filled with chagrin.<br>
You should ask for forgiveness and pray."<br>
<p>
<h4>from Al Willis </h4>
I'm not sure that this story's a fake.<br>
Could be history has made a mistake.<br>
But in Adam's last will,<br>
He left one dollar bill<br>
To Eve, plus a very tired snake.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Pooh</h4>
There once was a girl up the street<br>
Who really was into white sheep. <br>
On her lawn, they would graze<br>
To the neighbor's amaze, <br>
And her babies, when born, they did bleat.
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
I once asked a man from Antietam<br>
Why he cut his nuts off and then beat 'em.<br>
"She's pregnant again<br>
With kid number ten.<br>
My wife says I won't ever need 'em."<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
The French can brag on romance;<br>
The Spanish, flamenco dance;<br>
Ubangis, their lips;<br>
Russian women, their hips;<br>
But I'll brag on what's in my pants!<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
The headlines were plain to see --<br>
CONGRESSMAN SLAMS INTO TREE!!!<br>
So I sat there and pondered,<br>
The money they squandered,<br>
We should teach all those bastards to ski!<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
Strom Thurmond's the one I am cussing,<br>
Spent the week in the hospital fussing.<br>
And we get the bill;<br>
He's a hard one to kill;<br>
Ought to take the old bastard out schussing.<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
I can't understand all the moaning,<br>
About all this business of cloning.<br>
You don't have to undress,<br>
And you don't have the mess<br>
Like you do with the usual boning.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
There once was a woman named Kit<br>
Who made love to a dead man named Britt.<br>
She got quite a tiff<br>
Going down on the stiff,<br>
But she cried the next day when Britt split!<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
A masochistic young man of Split<br>
Ate his peaches complete with the pit.<br>
'Twas not for the stone,<br>
He claimed, but alone<br>
For the smart that remained when he shit.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
Car-mad Melanie frequently traps<br>
Young drivers in the pits -- lucky chaps.<br>
Then she makes record time<br>
In position 69,<br>
Coming first after 25 laps.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
A gent with a condom or three,<br>
Met a lass on the streets of Paris.<br>
He asked, "Are these needed?"<br>
She smiled and conceeded,<br>
"It depends on what's in it for me."<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
Your limerick, I am refuting;<br>
Of its worth, there is no disputing.<br>
The spelling is bad;<br>
The meter is sad.<br>
I suggest that you stick to computing.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jeff</h4>
Now Dodie and Di met their untimely ends;<br>
A certain clear message their tragedy sends.<br>
They shouldn't have speeded;<br>
Seat belts were needed.<br>
But that's just the way the Mercedes Benz.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
An American man who was rich<br>
Had for English fox-hunting an itch.<br>
But he never would know<br>
That one yells "Tallyho!"<br>
Not "There goes the son-of-a-bitch!"<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
There was an old fellow named Knute,<br>
Who knew Hell was the end of his route.<br>
He committed each sin<br>
With a satisfied grin,<br>
Thanking Heaven that Eve ate the fruit.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
A lady quite broad in the beam<br>
Was not as obese as would seem.<br>
Though her overall girth<br>
Would quite darken the Earth,<br>
It left other planets agleam.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
Those fellows named Mason and Dixon<br>
Were hoping the line they were fixin'<br>
Would keep damn Yankee swells<br>
From those sweet Southern Belles,<br>
So bad blood with good blood ain't mixin'.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
The evangelists seen on TV,<br>
Who claim they're of God's ministry,<br>
May cite chapter and verse,<br>
But are con men and worse,<br>
And are masters of hypocrisy.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Tony Davie Collection</h4>
Let's hear it for Archbishop Carey;<br>
A reverend cannot be a fairy.<br>
Those dog-collared queers<br>
Will be out on their ears,<br>
Before you can say a Hail Mary.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Warrick Elrod</h4>
Men's actions can fill one with tears,<br>
And despair for the forthcoming years.<br>
What a wonderful place<br>
Were the whole human race<br>
On vacation for ten thousand years.<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
In the first place, old Bill's like a cat;<br>
He'll land on all fours; believe that.<br>
In the second place,<br>
If he fell on his face,<br>
I doubt that he'd ever fall flat.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Mr Malo</h4>
If leaving the church they were booed?<br>
I'd say that it was very rude.<br>
But knowing the facts<br>
They would give him the axe...<br>
Typical Christian attitude!<br>
<p>
<h4>from Rusty Smith</h4>
Old Billy's in trouble in spades,<br>
And Hillary's now quite afraid.<br>
Guess her conscience requires<br>
She quell her desires,<br>
Now that hubby's spreading his AIDES.<br>
<p>
<h4>from kj</h4>
Bill Clinton sat through depositions;<br>
'Twas asked 'bout erectile conditions.<br>
"Do you have a strange cleft?<br>
Does it bend to the left?<br>
Does it work best in certain positions?"<br>
<p>
<h4>from Peter W</h4>
I'm sick of this Monica dross;<br>
I couldn't give a shit or a toss.<br>
But did the old scrubber<br>
Make Bill wear a ribber,<br>
Or did he just ask her to floss?<br>
<p>
<h4>from D D Hays</h4>
Clinton just had to meet her;<br>
He thought that no one was sweeter.<br>
They had sex on the phone,<br>
And when they were alone,<br>
They played games like 'Swallow the Leader'.<br>
<p>
<h4>from John Griffin</h4>
Clinton's ship sails along in retreat;<br>
Captain Billy, you've been indiscrete.<br>
Hands off those udders;<br>
Tend to the rudders,<br>
And try to control the first meat!<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
New allegations abound;<br>
There's evidence yet to be found.<br>
I don't know how it ends,<br>
But I'll tell you this, frineds,<br>
That thing of his sure gets around.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Annie Jay</h4>
One can tell the wheat from the chaff,<br>
If church-going Bill makes you laugh.<br>
Like the 23rd song,<br>
Which Bill got all wrong:<br>
He comforts his rod in his staff.<br>
<p>
<h4>from D. Melton</h4>
A vintner who calls himself Stu<br>
Took a fancy to his corkscrew.<br>
So he pierced a mole<br>
Next to his asshole;<br>
Now his shit comes out curlycue.<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
I've had my fill of old farts,<br>
Like Reagan and Bush for starts.<br>
I'd rather have Gore<br>
And Bill and his whore,<br>
Than Ross and his fucking charts.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
The Voyage of the Ancient Mariner;<br>
Two guys and a gal -- they were sharin' her.<br>
'Tis true that the crew<br>
Was bigger than two,<br>
But more would have too much wear on her.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
My pussy is big, black and furry<br>
And toothy, which makes my men worry.<br>
But gently I sooth them;<br>
It only chews them,<br>
If they're in too much of a hurry.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
Said Siegfried to Roy at the zoo,<br>
"Be careful in all that you do.<br>
Keep those lions at bay,<br>
Or it will, I must say,<br>
Be the first time a pussy ate you!"<br>
<p>
<h4>from Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
There once was a man from Rangoon;<br>
From his butt, he could play quite a tune.<br>
At the end of each show,<br>
He would really let go<br>
With an exclamatory BARROOOMMMM!!!<br>
<p>
<h4>from Arden</h4>
There once was a maid from Rangoon<br>
Who had quite a set of pontoons.<br>
Each half of her bra<br>
Was bigger by far,<br>
Than any two helium balloons.<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
Ah yes! Now it's starting to fit;<br>
Coming together now bit by bit.<br>
Masturbate and go blind...<br>
Jeeze I'm in a bind;<br>
No wonder I can't see worth shit!<br>
<p>
<h4>from Kaylin Brandon</h4>
I'd have more respect for the heel<br>
If he said "Yeah, I had her. Big deal.<br>
That's between me and my wife,<br>
It's not my public life --<br>
Let's discuss issues that are real."<br>
<p>
<h4>from MrMalo</h4>
Poor Monica never knew it,<br>
But Tripp who was privy to it,<br>
Just couldn't be trusted.<br>
Now Monica's busted...<br>
Had a good White House job and she blew it.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Richard H</h4>
I voted for Bill and how;<br>
I'd vote the same way, right now.<br>
The issue no doubt<br>
That I care about<br>
Is Jones...not Paula, but Dow!<br>
<p>
<h4>from Cybercelt</h4>
Sonny Bono went out for a ski,<br>
But was tragically hit by a tree.<br>
A nurse asked with a purr,<br>
Was it Pine or a Fir?<br>
"I go Yew babe," he sang mournfully.<br>
<p>
<h4>from Writerman</h4>
Some people ask "Where have you been?<br>
Have you been living in sin?"<br>
I don't mind confiding,<br>
I've been somewhere in hiding,<br>
With a hooker, some penguins, and gin.<br>
<p>
<h4>from H. Myers</h4>
"Let's try it this new way," said Jack<br>
As he winked at the girl in the sack.<br>
She turned and she grunted,<br>
"I should be affronted,<br>
But this time I'm taken aback!"<br>
