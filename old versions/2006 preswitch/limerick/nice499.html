A vain woman, finding a stone,<br>
Thought it might be precious to own.<br>
But she found that the gem<br>
Wasn't creme-de-la-creme,<br>
So she left it and walked on alone.

This limerick, dear friends, was my first.<br>
And though I know no one's side it will burst,<br>
I thought it was a riot<br>
And hope someone will buy it,<br>
And make me rich... (Signed, Financially Cursed )

Beethoven justly may boast<br>
That in music he did more than most.<br>
His setting to Schiller<br>

Rousseau, the great libertarian,<br>
Celebrated the noble barbarian.<br>
Using science abysmal,<br>
He found society dismal,<br>
And made politics contractarian.

An Englishman well known as Hobbes<br>
Had a most dreadful fear of the mobs.<br>
Catholics he berated,<br>
While Puritans he hated,<br>
And Levellers drove him to sobs.

I was parked in the lane where folks pass<br>
'Cos the rain was too deep on the grass ...<br>
About tickets, I'd learned<br>
Not to be too concerned &#151<br>
'Cos the sheriff is taking my class!

<i>The poet comments, "(in answer to Friar's 03/19/99 question)"</i>
<p>This is 555-1234<br>
Where no one can answer the door<br>
Or reply to the phone ...<br>
So please wait for the tone<br>
And leave number, when calling, and more!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is the message you get on my answering machine at home -- except for the number, which ends
in 4, but is otherwise different"</i>

There once was a playful old geezer<br>
Who'd pinch his young nurse, just to tease her,<br>
But she didn't mind<br>
'Cos she was inclined<br>
To keep his bed-pan in the freezer!

Whose lesson grew lesser and lesser<br>
With each dummy found<br>
Had been fooled by the sound<br>
During roll, of a tape going "Yessir!"
