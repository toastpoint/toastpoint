Why such a long neck, brontosaurus? ...<br>
Perhaps it affords<br>
You the long vocal cords<br>
To sing bass in a dinosaur chorus!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "According to the April 30 edition of <i>Science</i>,
Brontosaurus couldn't have eaten treetops after all, because the bones in its neck would
have prevented it from lifting its head much above ground level"</i>
<p>
Meditations on love by two swamis<br>
So ravished two kissing gouramis<br>
Whenever they pucker<br>
They make such a sucker<br>
Their fish tank's engulfed by tsunamis!

Objective about a being<br>
Subjective in being<br>
Space and time in being<br>
Am I being<br>
Being I!

A political speaker named Hutch<br>
Said, "The audience noises are such-<br>
I can't hear myself speak!"<br>
Smirked his foe, tongue-in-cheek,<br>
"Well, don't worry...You ain't missin' much!"

A confident hunter says I'm aware of one sneaky o' hare<br>
Who always roams in pairs<br>
I being quite wise, I'll double my prize<br>
The sneaky o' hare's  forwarned his pair and split two separate ways.<br>
The hunter realized with energy sized these hare's were no compare!

Once a knight, called Sir Menper, did go<br>
Through a lake to save damsels in woe<br>
Then he lit a huge fire<br>
For to dry their attire ...<br>
Horse is wet, Menper's pyre, ladies glow!

They say love makes the world go around ...<br>
My friend Mark adores May, who has found<br>
She loves Matt, who is gay<br>
And loves Mark, who loves May<br>

A mathematician called Madder<br>
Whose snake scared his wife up a ladder<br>
Was asked by her, "Pray &#151<br>
Can you take it away?"<br>
But replied, "No, I can't ...  it's an adder!"
<p>A most beautiful star called Michelle<br>
On the rack will make <i>People</i> mag sell ...<br>
But the rack she'd prefer<br>
Is the kind to stretch her &#151<br>
'Cos her leg-lengths, she says, don't excel!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "She wants longer legs and curls, apparently"</i>
