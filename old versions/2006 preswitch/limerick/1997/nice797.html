<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/31/97</h3>
The dog days are here, everywhere<br>
This humidity's pig-hard to bear<br>
You feel sloth on the street<br>
Tryin' to outfox the heat<br>
'Cos your AC can't beetle out there!
<hr>

A big-nosed Hawaiian young man<br>
Had a shnoz large and flat like a fan<br>
On a windy day he<br>
Held his face to the lee<br>
And his outrigger sailed to Japan!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "if you think that one stunk, 
you haven't smelled NOTHIN yet."</i>
<p>
an amatuer poet named bob<br>
wrote lim'ricks that almost were great<br>
though his meter was good<br>
and his imagery clear<br>
he was never successful at rhymes
<hr>
<h3>Deeboy writes 07/31/97</h3>
He sat on a bar stool a-drinkin'<br>
And of all of his troubles a-thinkin';<br>
The more that he thought<br>
The more booze he bought<br>
And drunk, he did get a-stinkin'.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/30/97</h3>
Could Colorado State University<br>
Have had its library books stored in a worse city? <br>
I hope their admin overlooks<br>
Fines on overdue books<br>
If returned with no trace of immersity!

When lawyers dine out, don't you know,<br>
They have split-fee soup, just for show.<br>
They dazzle their quest,<br>
And I can attest<br>
That the entree is broiled squid pro quo!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I saw these puns in Readers Digest."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/29/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Do the monkeys on Florida's Keys<br>
Overstrip bark from red mangrove trees?<br>
"To find out," thought a judge<br>
"There I'll solemnly trudge" ...<br>
But she sank in mud up to her knees!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, " ... at least according to yesterday's Boston Globe"</i>
<p>
Can't we ban smokers outside a store<br>
From their lighting up right by the door?<br>
On my way to the car<br>
I inhale so much tar<br>
That I gag for five minutes or more!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:dougfromupland@keyway.net>DougFromUpland</a> writes 07/28/97</h3>
On the land, it's as clear as can be,<br>
Do for you, then you must do for me.<br>
In the water are lures,<br>
You watch mine, I'll watch yours.<br>
"Squid pro quo" is the way of the sea.

<i>The poet comments, "Fishies also have to cover each other.  Ask the Sturgeon General."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Paul A Jones writes 07/26/97</h3>
An entomologist heard, of some flies,<br>
"Not real eclosed, threatening some Thais."<br>
With his nets out, to beat the clock<br>
He flew straight to Bangkok ... <br>
Aw, they slur bad, those Arkansas guys!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Tried using your Paula Jones first line, but it wouldn't work ..."</i>  <i>The 
poet also comments, "It's <em>eclosed</em> (emerged from pupa case), not <em>enclosed</em>. 
(Think about it ... should have heard "Not really closed, threatening some thighs")"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point apologizes for his clueless editing.</i>
<hr>

Now <a href=#frank>Frank</a> is a guy who can rhyme.<br>
Gold stars will appear in no time.<br>
He can write on the run<br>
And can't be outdone.<br>
That guy is so good it's a crime!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:skippy@airmail.net>Skippy</a> shares a classic 07/24/97</h3>
There once was a man named ROCK<br>
Whose libido was up round the CLOCK!<br>
The women revered him<br>
Though some of them feared him..<br>
Because he has a 13 inch... SCAR down the side of his face.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ha.. bet you were about to say that wasnt squeaky clean!"</i>
<p>
<I>Oh, ha ha.</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:skippy@airmail.net>Skippy</a> shares a classic 07/24/97</h3>
There once was a man from Peru...<br>
Who thought limericks should end on line two.<p>
<I>This is one of Toast Point's favorites.  Almost like "I see you shiver with antici........pation!"</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:dbutt@gcbn.com>Dennis B.</a> writes 07/23/97</h3>
The birthday of Rebecca Best<br>
Was a day filled with folly & jest<br>
When the entire bunch<br>
Then took her to lunch<br>
Oh, Rebecca now knew she was blessed!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Rebecca's birthday is 7/24 so send her a limerick of your own through me. (nice please)"</i>
<p>
<I>Apologies to the birthday girl that this didn't get posted 'til the 25th.  Toast Point's been a little frazzled lately.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Whyte9ght writes 07/23/97</h3>
Tennis?  No, not in this dress!<br>
I know that I try to impress - <br>
But playing in skirts and long sleeves<br>
I find it hard to believe<br>
That I don't fall down on my ass!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'm writing in English this time."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:fstringe@direct.ca>fr&#169;de</a> writes 07/22/97</h3>
He did not go very far<br>
Last night with her in the car<br>
He stopped to unzip<br>
Then helped her to strip<br>
And now went further by far
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "-and simple."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/22/97</h3>
A most wanted fugitive, Cunanan<br>
Tries to do everythin' that he's doin' anon<br>
He's so dab at disguise<br>
That the poor FBI's<br>
At a loss to know what to be cluein' in on!

<hr>
<h3><a name="frank">Frank</a> writes 07/21/97</h3>
Julie Bryan wrote (tenth of July)<br>
A lim'rick that just made me cry.<br>
At this form, is she new?<br>
Of five lines, she rhymed two!<br>
Perhaps she should have one more try.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Just an observation offered in jest."</i>
<p>
I've submitted a rhyme to Toast Point,<br>
Having just now discovered this joint.<br>
I was sent here by Al,<br>
He's a  lim'ricking pal,<br>
Who told where my browser should point!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "With thanks to Al Willis for the tip."</i>
<p>
A Russian supply ship, I fear,<br>
Has crippled the space station, Mir.<br>
It bumped into Specter,<br>
And practically wrecked her.<br>
I doubt it will last one more year.
<p>
One night, as I gazed at the stars,<br>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
I spotted the Red Planet, Mars,<br>
And thought of the rover<br>
Sent to look it over<br>
For water, air, hotels, and bars!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I can't seen to keep my thoughts Earth-bound, today."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/21/97</h3>
James Stewart was truly a great ham<br>
In so many kinds of film program<br>
But I liked him the most<br>
Playing <i>Harvey</i>'s good host ...<br>
An eccentric, but no more than I am!

<hr>
<h3>Maggot writes 07/20/97</h3>
There once was a man with a knife<br>
That he used to murder his wife<br>
His motive was plain<br>
It's because he's insane<br>
So they gave him 20 to life!
<p>
There once was a girl with a coat<br>
That was made from the fur of a goat.<br>
She would go for a walk<br>
And find someone to stalk,<br>
Then pounce and rip out their throat.
<p>
<I>Too many horror movies this weekend, Maggot?</I>

<h3>Whyte9ght writes 07/19/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Jiak kopi and go pak tor<br>
Talk like that in Singapore<br>
England, Hokkien and Malay<br>
Spiak like that at work and play<br>
This is called our Singlish, lor
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Definitions:<br>
<ul>
<li>
  Jiak kopi : lit. "Eat coffee".  Means to have a friendly drink and chat with a friend.  Originated from Hokkien.  Eg. Want to go jiak kopi? 
<li>
go pak tor: Courting.  Eg. My parents pak tor for 7 years before getting married
<li>
England: Corruption of "English" Eg.  You think your England very the good is it?
<li>
Hokkien: A Chinese dialect from the present day Fujian province in China
<li>
Malay: A language from South East Asia
<li>
Spiak: Corruption of "speak"
<li>
Singlish:  The local variety of English.  Contraction of "Singapore English"
<li>
lor: Added to end of sentences to give emphasis
</ul>
These definitions are my own, and subject to debate.  The grammartical forms are true to life and are corrupted, if any one minds.

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/19/97</h3>
The language that all of us speak<br>
Is English, and it is unique.<br>
For when we read "break,"<br>
We rhyme it with "cake."<br>
I think Mr. Webster's a freak.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Any English teachers out there?"</i>
<p>
<I>All of us, indeed.  Non-English speakers, don't bother to flame, unless you do it in a foreign language in limerical form.</I>

An eight-nostrilled man in Cancun<br>
Blows his nose-organ nicely in tune<br>
Till the ragweeds first bloom<br>
When he suffers from rheum<br>
So he plays a mouth-organ in June!
<p>
The Mir crew has proved itself able<br>
To crash, and now cut a power cable ...<br>
Is there vodka on board?<br>
If so, how much still stored?<br>
Used as fuel, could it save their space stable?
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 07/17/97</h3>
My favorite game is roulette,<br>
But I lose every time that I bet.<br>
Will you please stop the press!<br>
I have to digress,<br>
Because my sweet baby's all wet.

Is Paula Jones speaking the truth?<br>
Should we hire more than one sleuth?<br>
Was Clinton just smitten<br>
By this sexy kitten?<br>
And will we find out in our youth?
<p>
While sipping a strawberry daquiri<br>
I wanted an icy lime daquiri.<br>
It would have been nice <br>
But I ran out of ice.<br>
So I finished my strawberry daquiri.
<p>
While sipping a strawberry daquiri<br>
I found myself pond'rin this query.<br>
If I spent my time <br>
Just rhyming this rhyme<br>
Would I finish this strawberry daquiri?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Help Oh Great Sage!  My wife said I must use a different word when rhyming but I told her that cleverness & being pure of spirit could earn a poet a Golden Star!"</i>
<p>
<I>Cleverness, yes.  Pureness of spirit has no place in a Toast Point contest (see the naughty limericks if you don't believe me).</I>

There was an old spinster named Harriet<br>
Who could rope anything with her lariat.<br>
She had one final thought ...<br>
As she tossed out the knot ......<br>
Whatever she caught...she would marry it !
<hr>

<h3>Dua writes 07/16/97</h3>
Toast Point collects silly lim'ricks<br>
But most of them have to use gimmicks<br>
Their lines do not scan,<br>
So quick as you can<br>
Enter some quality lim'ricks!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My reaction to the limericks you've posted."</i>
<p>

<I>Toast Point always welcomes quality work.</I>
<p>
There was an old lady from Sace,<br>
Who kept up a terrible pace.<br>
To get her to stop<br>
They had to air-drop<br>
A billboard in front of her face.

It's cold and dark as night,<br>
Fires heat houses just right<br>
Soft sprinkles of snow,<br>
Sprinkle and glow.<br>
Christmas lights twinkle and shine sweet bright.
<p>
It's gonna be a pretty day,<br>
I can almost hear my favorite blue jay.<br>
See the kids run,<br>
Being bathed in the sun.<br>
Soon it will be the beginning of May.

Tennis?  No, not in this dress!<br>
My contacts could fall out, I guess....<br>
These high heels won't pack it.....<br>
I've broken my raquet....<br>
So wouldn't you rather play Scrabble?

When I'm buried, for crying out loud,<br>
Don't spend very much; I'm not proud.<br>
Use a white gunnysack,<br>
All front and no back.<br>
They call it a cheap pauper's shroud.

If an agent wants to make a new star,<br>
He has to consider P. R.<br>
He must say she is agin'<br>
And her background is Cajun.<br>
And, to that, I say HARDY-HAR-HAR!

Most Christians, I believe you'll concede,<br>
Love money and chase it, indeed.<br>
They save it in banks,<br>
Those dollars and Francs,<br>
And they call it the Nicene Greed.

There once was a woman who married.<br>
She thought that she really loved Larry.<br>

She wanted no spouse,<br>
She tried to commit hari-kari.

James Stewart was truly a great ham<br>
For Capra, Hitch, Mann - quite an amalgam<br>
In Philadelphia Story, he impressed<br>
But 'twas Harvey I liked best<br>
'Cos he was just as eccentric as I am!

Why a Limerick it takes ?<br>
As his finger he shakes...<br>
Could'ae nailed me with just a one Line - eh

<a href=#stewart>Mr. Stewart</a> has managed to score<br>
Though his poem didn't finish its chore.<br>
I like it, however;<br>
It's wistful and clever,<br>
And proves that, at times, Les is more!
<p>
A bombastic movie - Con Air<br>
Was bereft of all humor or flair,<br>
But, despite its detractors,<br>
Gave three brainy actors<br>
A rare chance to let down their hair.
<p>
About Tyson I don't need to rant any,<br>
And excuses?  Don't think that I'll grant any!<br>
I only point out<br>
That the asinine lout<br>
Shares a habit with Shakespeare's Mark Antony.

You learned quite a lot, mon cher.<br>
Your knowledge is extraordinaire.<br>
At all of those schools,<br>
You were taught by damn fools<br>
If they taught you that pie are square!

<I>Everyone knows that pie are round!</I>

A Martian inhabitant said,<br>
"A strange thing aroused me from bed,<br>
It clanks and it squeals,<br>
And runs on six wheels,<br>
Has panels instead of a head.
<p>
A label was stuck on its back,<br>
Right under a balloon air sac, <br>
It gave an address, <br>
Which said to express, <br>
If found, back to Radio Shack!"

A limerick, I wish I could write.<br>
I could if I were more bright<br>
But you have to rhyme<br>
And try to keep time<br>
And I can't...

<h3>FLLWP shares a classic 07/02/97</h3>
When HEAVEN was Women "out-dishin' "...<br>
mine didn't work out - so I'm "wishin' "...<br>
and i say with a grin...<br>
should I try it "agin' "...<br>
cause I'd sure like to do some "KATT-FISHIN' "
<p>
She called me last night on the phone...<br>
from her village they call "EL CAHON"...<br>
I delighted to hear her...<br>
and it drew us both nearer..<br>
but the "hang-up" sure left me ALONE!
<p>
The 3rd part of this ditty I've written...<br>
As I straddle my drafting stool---smitten...<br>
It is obvious that...<br>
Tho' she calls herself Katt...<br>
well it really turns out... she's a kitten.
<p>
So how do I show her that I ...<br>
am an average, well-meaning guy...<br>
this has got to do somethin'...<br>
to get her heart pumpin'....<br>
If it doesn't  I'll have to ask WHY?
<p>
Well I do tend to just ramble ON...<br>
so I hope you're not wishin' me gone...<br>
and your thanks will increase...<br>
'cause you'll know that at least...<br>
this gives excercise now.....when you YAWN.....
