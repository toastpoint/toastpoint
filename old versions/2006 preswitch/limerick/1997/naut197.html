<h3>Danthomas writes 01/31/97</h3>
Said a friend to Julieanne Moore<br>
"Goddammit, you dumb ugly whore,<br>
I hate to be crass<br>
But good God, your ass<br>
Makes all the guy's eyes quite sore!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Subject frequently shows off ass to public, 
really not worth the effort of focusing the eye."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:>Mad Max</a> writes 01/31/97</h3>
There once was a salesman named Glick<br>
who thought of himself as "slick".<br>
while peddling  product<br>
he forgot his conduct.<br>
He's now known as slick Glick the dick!
<p>
While noting the bulge in his trousers<br>
He proceeded to download web browsers.<br>
He then searched for J PEG's<br>
Of blondes doing redheads<br>
And cats fucking dogs in the flowers!
<p>
The chill makes her nipples so perky<br>
And the sex she desires is quirky.<br>
Black latex and chains,<br>
The bonus is pain;<br>
It oft makes her cunt drip like a slurpee!
<p>
When Bill Ron coughs out a lung,<br>
Ask "Is english his native tongue?"<br>
Poor thing has no rhythm<br>
And his head's full of jism,<br>
Snot, boogers and dead whore cum!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The "coughing out of a lung" refers to rampant opinion (from what I read) of his/her prose."</i>
<p>
<i>He hasn't been around much lately, actually...</i>

While noting the bulge in his trousers<br>
A gentleman, Ashley, carouses<br>
In rubber with zips<br>
And with sixteen foot whips<br>
But enjoys it most wearing girls' blouses
<p>
ADVICE: Get a ring through your cock<br>
And  you'll prob'ly receive a rude shock<br>
It gets "pus"sy and hairy<br>
And might look quite scary<br>
So cover it up with a sock!
<p>
<i>Ewwww!</i>
<p>
There was a young man from Berlin<br>
Who could crack walnuts with his foreskin<br>
With the head of his dick<br>
He could break four-inch-thick<br>
Planks of wood with just one giant swing
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A singer whose stage name was Snoopy<br>
Was being sucked off by a groupie<br>
She was well versed in head<br>
For she'd toured with the Dead<br>
It was three hours until he went droopy!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It must be late!"</i>
<p>
The dead whore that was kept in the cave<br>
Finally got too smelly for Dave<br>
So he sold her to Pete<br>
In the cave down the street<br>
And dug up a new one from a grave!
<p>
<i>The Sage lets this one go by...</i>

<h3>Writerman writes 01/31/97</h3>
While noting the bulge in his trousers<br>
She fingered herself to arouse "hers"<br>
This act made the fellow<br>
So sex-crazed he did bellow<br>
Eu-rekas! and Zow-ies!! and Yow-zers!!!
<p>
Have you met my inflatable wife?<br>
She's truly the love of my life!<br>
She fucks like a pup<br>
If you keep her pumped up<br>
And remind her that you've got a knife!!!

"The chill makes my nipples so perky,"<br>
Said the debutante from Albuquerque,<br>
"To my lover's delight<br>
They'll stay hard all the night<br>
And he can chew on them just like beef jerky!"
<p>
<h4>and a variation...</h4>
"The chill makes my nipples so perky,"<br>
Said the debutante from Albuquerque<br>
"They get my lover excited<br>
And without being invited<br>
He goes down and gobbles me like a turkey!"
<p>
My lover is fond of massage<br>
So I pounded her with a barrage<br>
Of thumps on her back<br>
And then to help her relax<br>
I used a sledgehammer from the garage!
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Is getting divorced soon, I see<br>
And the papers all claim<br>
That she'll then change her name<br>
She wants to be known as Leslie!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Leslie -- Less Lee -- geddit?!  Oh well - it wasn't very rude anyway :)"</i>
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A new year is ripe in the making<br>
And so soon resolutions I'm breaking - <br>
My poor body's abused<br>
With food, drugs and booze,<br>
And as for sex, my poor balls ain't stopped aching!

<h3><a href=mailto:JLMBJMRP@sisna.com>Jim</a> writes 01/25/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A conservative senator, Horatio,<br>
Hated perverted sex, and he'd say so,<br>
But he lost his aversion<br>
To sexual perversion<br>
When he learned "sodomy" includes fellatio!
<p>
If Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Should avail herself to me,<br>
I'd flip a dime<br>
To see if first time<br>
I'd get head or tail, you see.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:stuartb@hermes50.hpa.com.au>Thunderwing</a> writes 01/24/97</h3>
A lesbian on a divan<br>
Ate sushi straight out of a can<br>
The smell of the fish<br>
And the rice made her wish<br>
That her lover'd come back from Japan!
<p>
A couple in bed in South London<br>
Did not think to first buy a condom<br>
With a clear plastic bag<br>
Tied on with an old rag<br>
They made do, and they did it - it stayed on!
<p>
A young man who lived in Berlin<br>
Could crack walnuts with his foreskin<br>
He could smash a wine glass<br>
With the crack of his ass<br>
And his girfriend could make pencils blunt.
<p>
<i>Ooo, so promising, and then the last line...</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:rwalker@mail.isbe.state.il.us>Gale Richard Walker</a> writes 01/24/97</h3>
In Gorgeous George's gorgeous Georgian gorge,<br>
Gorging orgies and orgy gorging forge<br>
A horde of Ladies whoring<br>
To the Lords of Hades snoring,<br>
When George's gorgeous orgied gorgers gorge.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is  both a tongue-twister
and a Spoonerick (horde of ladies/
Lords of Hades);
snoring refers to the gorging orgies
in which the men (Lords of Hades)
 have overeaten and become sleepy.
I have never seen a limerick that does all
three:  tongue-twister, spoonerick, and maintain
a reasonable (subtle) meaning.  RSVP
Thanks.  Enjoy."</i>
<p>
<i>Very impressive, except for the scansion.</i>
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 01/24/97</h3>
Wow! Highly insulted am I<br>
That the 'whore' entry did not fly<br>
You say variation<br>
Makes publication<br>
So why in the fuck did you lie?!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Why publish CeeJay's variations and not mine?"
Toast Point replies, "Very simple.  The Nantucket limerick isn't completely 
revolting the way the whore in a cave limerick is."</I>
<p>

A lesbian on a divan<br>
Had a vibrator (made in Taiwan)<br>
In the midst of a stroke<br>
The fucking thing broke<br>
So she suffered 'blue balls' until dawn!
<hr>
<h3>Wandering Loon writes 01/23/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
My lover is fond of massage<br>
So I rub her with creamy fromage<br>
And a soft tickle give her<br>
Till her quim starts to quiver<br>
Then go in with my steaming sausage (saw-saazh?)

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mcollins@tsa.com>Mad Max</a> writes 01/23/97</h3>
There once was a young lady from Sweden,<br>
Who on my dick was a eat'n.<br>
She reached up with her hand,<br>
But I said "No thanks, ma'am",<br>
I'd rather be eaten than beaten!
<p>
A lesbian on a divan<br>
Held her lover's face to her can.<br>
But for lunch, she'd had beans,<br>
And she burst at the seams.<br>
So you could say, "The shit hit her fan"!
<p>
A lesbian on a divan<br>
Her backside with dildo did ram.<br>
She shuddered and shook,<br>
Gasped and all of it took,<br>
Like a gay man up the can!
<p>
My lover is fond of massage<br>
But sometimes I find it odd;<br>
While rubbing and stroking,<br>
Prodding and poking,<br>
She drips more than when dick shoots a wad!

<h3>CeeJay writes 01/23/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Said his Dad to a lad from Nantucket,<br>
"Son, your dick will soon grow, 'til with luck it<br>
Will hang down to the floor:<br>
That'll help you to score,<br>
Or if not, you can stay home and suck it!"
<p>
<I>Toast Point apologizes to CeeJay - the entry just showed up in his mailbox yesterday.  As you can see, it's not the Nantucket theme that's banned, just sheer repetition.  Clever variations are 
encouraged!</I>
<hr>
The Sage nixed Jeeve's "whore" entry.

<h3>JT writes 01/22/97</h3>
A lesbian on a divan<br>
Her fav'rite vibrator in hand<br>
Said twixt the moaning<br>
And buzzing and groaning:<br>
"I'm coming as quick as I can."

<i>The poet comments, "An adaptation of one originally written for my wife.
"</i>

A milkmaid addressing her cows<br>
Concluded her speech with some bows.<br>
As the buxom thing bent,<br>
Her fabric was rent,<br>
And she utterly fell from her blouse!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Integrate this with the Pamela Anderson Lee theme, and you have some lovely imagery indeed!</I>
<hr>
<h3>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan writes 01/21/97</h3>
Adlines for condoms are a heap,<br>
Some classy and some really cheap,<br>
A good one I remember,<br>
Didn't refer to any member,<br>
But simply read 'Look Before You Leap!'

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Overheard joke"</i>

A frustrated chap from Cape Cod<br>
Believes in a feminine God:<br>
Each time his wife has a m-<br>
ultiple orgasm<br>
He only gets one, the poor sod!

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Said a man from Nantucket, "I'm sick<br>
Of being asked 'DO you suck on your dick?'"<br>
"I would rather my dong<br>
Were a quarter as long,<br>
And, to compensate, four times as thick!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I guess this is going to earn me another glare from the Sage...</i>
<p>
<I>Oh contraire, we like this one!</I>

AOL's now a bitch to log onto -<br>

Right up your ass... if they want to!

Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Broke down on I-5 recently.<br>
I heard the cop say,<br>
"You should call triple A."<br>
She replied, "What for?!  I'm triple D!"

<I>Oh, she must be more than <b>that</b>!</I>

<h3>CeeJay writes 01/16/97</h3>
There is a young fellow called Dave<br>
Who keeps a dead horse in his cave.<br>
It smells worse than shit,<br>
But his neighbours admit<br>
That his goulash is what they all crave!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yummy!"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage glares at the poet.</I>

<h3>Crispy writes 1/15</h3>
" Peccadillo" has same root in sin.<br>
As adjective "impeccable"'s in,<br>
While courage is "pecker"'<br>
Or something to wreck her,<br>
You can call it "Peter", and grin!

<hr>
<h3>Psycho writes 01/14/97</h3>
Jeeves is totally right -<br>
Pamela Anderson Lee is a fright!<br>
She's such a witch<br>
A skank and a bitch<br>
Whose silicone pops out at night!

A lesbian on a divan - <br>
A devoted fan of Elton John - <br>
Strove to name her vibrator,<br>
And a little while later,<br>
Stated, "He shall be 'leave on'!"
<p>
<I>Hee hee.  Toast Point has always liked that song, although like so many of Elton's songs, he hasn't a clue what it means.</I>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Do the limericks get special consideration if they use TP-provided first lines?"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage answers, "Nope.  They're just there to kick-start your brains."  Toast Point, however, is delighted when one of them strikes everyone's fancy, like the Pamela Anderson one this month.</I>
<p>

A tight-assed young girl that I know<br>
Had me ream her 10 times in a row.<br>
Now cornhole-ing that lass<br>
Is a pain in MY ass!<br>
We truly reap that which we sow!

<h3>Bertram Pantyshield submits a classic 1/14</h3>
There was a young lady from Sydney<br>
Who could take it right up to the kidney - <br>
Then a man from Quebec<br>
Took it up to her neck - <br>
He had a big one now, didn't he!!!!!

<hr>
<h3>CeeJay writes 01/13/97</h3>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Is a babe who's as big as can be.<br>
Her silicone valley<br>
Is where I would dally<br>
If I had a home by the sea!
<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>Writerman</a> writes 01/12/97</h3>
A blight left the King's royal purse<br>
With but a gold rubber (perverse!)<br>
When his wife and child died...<br>
His Majesty cried:<br>
"My condom for a hearse!"

<I>The Sage looks askance at the poet.</I>

<h3>Stargazer writes 01/09/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A lass with small breasts wished to raise them,<br>
For when guys saw their size, it would faze them.<br>
'Til a lad (Mark, by name)<br>
Said he swore that he came<br>
Not to seize her berries, but to praise them!

<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 01/09/97</h3>
<a href="#ww">WriterWoman</a>, you sound like a tease<br>
And your tits probably sag to your knees<br>
So from all of us guys<br>
That you fucking despise<br>
May your cunt be infested with fleas!
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Just received her divorce decree<br>
So to get through the day,<br>
With no one to lay,<br>
She bought a dildo the size of a tree!

<hr>
<h3>Emily writes 01/09/97</h3>
Charles Darwin was slow to direct us<br>
To the condor's uncertain prospectus - <br>
Consonantal mutation<br>
Means reincarnation<br>
As accessory to homo erectus!
<hr>
<h3>Monique de Plume shares a classic 01/09/97</h3>
I once met a fella named Roger<br>
Who married when he was a codger.<br>
His young wife was tight<br>
And try as he might,<br>
There was naught he could do to dislodge her.

<hr>
<h3>Dr. Dirty writes 01/08/97</h3>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Was the name of a bitch in Albany,<br>
She would get into trouble,<br>
With dogs, on the double,<br>

The patient, a sad sight to meet,<br>
Showed up with spots red as a beet,<br>
Which covered his mass,<br>
All caught from a lass,<br>
And not an ice cold toilet seat!

<h3>A girl from Des Moines writes 01/07/97</h3>
Anne was a girl from Des Moines<br>
Whose cunt was the size of a coin<br>
Her sex was so wussy<br>
Tom Jones liked her pussy<br>
But she went to fuck Johnny Burgoyne.
<hr>
<h3>Bad Girl writes 01/07/97</h3>
The teachers are dressing like sluts<br>
Showing off all their butts<br>
They go to their classes<br>
Letting boys grab their asses<br>
And sucking on their nuts.
<hr>
<h3>Me writes 01/07/97</h3>
There once was a girl from Dubuque<br>
Who sat there and ate her own puke<br>
She picked her own ass<br>
And ate it in class<br>
Then ate cum from some dude named Luke.
<hr>
<h3>Aylith Andromeda Anderson writes 01/07/97</h3>
The once was a guy named Nate<br>
Who used a Tickle-Me Elmo as bait<br>
He was such a wacko<br>
Then he became Jacko<br>
And went home to masturbate.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is inspired by the joke...
"What does Michael Jackson call Tickle-Me Elmo? Bait!""</i>
<hr>
<h3>Dr. Dirty writes 01/07/97</h3>
Supposedly tasting like pussy, he had found,<br>
An apple, very red, voluptous and round,<br>
After taking a bite of it,<br>
Found it tasted like shit,<br>
And only then did he remember to turn it around.
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
On her pubes had a green bee,<br>
Which forgot it was a vector,<br>
While sucking her pubic nectar,<br>
Turning every man green with envy.
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
A teacher from whom you cannot flee,<br>
Would catch you between her tits,<br>
And hide you inside her pits,<br>
Just to teach you the meaning of 'glee'.

A New Zealand playboy named Greaves<br>
Has his girls each way round, but believes<br>
In abandoning dames<br>
After one night of games,<br>
For a Kiwi just eats, roots, and leaves.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is based on a joke like the one about the panda on the Squeaky-clean page, but naughtier.
You know, of course, that the verb 'to root' has a particular meaning down under...
Happy New Year to Toast Point, Sage and all your contributors!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 01/06/97</h3>
This time of year can be quite depressing<br>
I find my Christmas high spirts regressing<br>
My cure?  Piss on Prozac<br>
I'll get my wife on her back<br>
And have her cunt give my cock some caressing!

Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 01/06/97</h3>
Give me a limerick that smacks of smut<br>
Something that comes from your revolting gut<br>
I don't care for a poem of squeak and clean<br>
But one dripping of slime and green cream<br>
Yes, give me one that smells like an overused slut!
<p>
Come on you with the poems of dead whores<br>
We can still give them limericks with festering sores<br>
We may not use tales of green meat<br>
Nor of hermits named Dave may we speak<br>
So give them more slime disgusting to their cores.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Bill Ron has been out with the flu but is back with smut and goo."</i>
<p>
<I>Oh, goody...</I>

There was a proud fucker from Cylon,<br>

There once was a man from Crete,<br>
Who triumphantly came on his feet,<br>
'Til the fateful day,<br>
He let a fine spray,<br>
And slipped, going down in defeat.

There once was a man named McNeer,<br>
Who said to his dear with a tear,<br>
"Your twat was hot,<br>
But now it's not,<br>
Flip over.  I'll do your rear."
<p>
There once was a trombonist named Art,<br>
Whose chapped lips would barely part,<br>
So whenever alone,<br>
He'd sit on his trombone,<br>
And practice Mozart with a fart.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My co-authors: my wife, Claudine Paris and my grandson, Dan Paris."</i><p>

I once knew a fella named Jerry<br>
Whose pecker was small as a berry<br>
When he went to pee<br>
He let nobody see<br>
Though he thought it petite but not very!

Dorothy said to the Tin Man, "I'm trusting<br>
That you won't find my preference disgusting.<br>
But I'll take the Wizard of Oz<br>
And it's simply because<br>
Although his joint's limp, it's not rusting."
<p>
<h4>By Dick Buenger</h4>
The Bishop refused to ordain<br>
His deacon who could not abstain.<br>
Instead of The Book, he <br>
Would worship the nooky<br>
Procured from the choir, his bane.
<p>
For my organ of sex I concede it<br>
Is my pleasure to know whence to lead it.<br>
If it sits like a stub,<br>
I give it a rub.<br>
Let it never be said, "I don't knead it."

<h4>By Irving Superior</h4>
The curse of gold.  When Midas ate<br>
Each dish he ate became gold plate.<br>
His daughter too<br>
Became Au,<br>
And when he had to urinate...
<p>
A professor of English named Ford<br>
Was writing a quote on the board;<br>
However in haste,<br>
He left out a space -<br>
THE PENIS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD.
<p>
<h4>By Lance Payne</h4>
Since their lust didn't have to be mastered,<br>
Kings "did it" whenever their ass stirred,<br>
And that explains why,<br>
Though a prince may rate high,<br>
A duke is so often a bastard!
<p>
<h4>By Ronald R. Jay</h4>
A royal handmaiden named Bess<br>
Caught the King in a state of undress.<br>
Said she, wet with pleasure,<br>
As her quim took his measure:<br>
"My ruler's twelve inches, no less!"
<p> 
<h4>By Martin Wellborn</h4>
I remember the night that I ate<br>
The girls' hockey team from Penn State.<br>
I worked my way round<br>
As they lay on the ground -<br>
Not unlike a wild rose - imbricate.<br>
<I>The poet comments, "Websters III : <b>imbricate</b> - overlapped at the margins"</I>
<p>
They've arrested a monk at St. Mallory's<br>
For molesting the nuns in the gallerys.<br>
"Just doing God's labor<br>
By loving my neighbor -<br>
Nunnilingus is only twelve calories."
<p>
<h4>By Margaret A. Murdock</h4>
A sensible man known as Guy<br>
One day asked his young bride, Miss Vi,<br>
When she would be stopping<br>
Her impulsive shopping,<br>
And she said that she would, buy and buy.
<p> 
<h4>By C. Webster Wheelock</h4>
A geology student named Victor<br>
Took his date to the river and dicked her.<br>
He admitted his fault<br>
In this heinous assault,<br>
But was proud of his 6 on the Richter.
<p>
<h4>By Michael Weinstein</h4>
A cheerleader named Betty-Jean Clark<br>
Drank some luminous paint for a lark.<br>
By December the cocks<br>
Of half of the jocks<br>
On the football team glowed in the dark.
<p>
<h4>By A.N. Wilkins</h4>
"Some precaution should not be despised,"<br>
The old Dean of Students advised.<br>
If the coeds here, friend,<br>
Were laid end to end,<br>
I wouldn't," he said, "be surprised."
<p>
(someone should apologise to Dorothy Parker)

<h4>By Neal Wilgus</h4>
Most limericks are so damn forgettable<br>
That it seems quite a shame and regrettable <br>
To waste so much time<br>
On mere meter and rhyme<br>
That won't fuck and don't pay and ain't edible.
