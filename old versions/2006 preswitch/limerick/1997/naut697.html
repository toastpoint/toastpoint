<h3><a href=mailto:cwhitchu@tassie.net.au>Craig Whitchurch</a> writes 06/29/97</h3>
An Adventure Bay man, big down under<br>
Is known by the women as "Thunder".<br>
One girl that he struck<br>
Passes out as they fuck<br>
The reason I guess is he stunned her.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This little gem is from the soon to be published "Limericks around Australia""</i>
<p>
Two nudists riding a horse<br>
Knocked over a bottle of sauce.<br>
It splattered their faces<br>
And lodged in rude places,<br>
Now I guess they can't have intercourse!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, ""Limericks around Australia" will be available before Christmas. Would you be interested in a copy?"</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point might.  If any readers are, <a href= cwhitchu@tassie.net.au>e-mail Craig</a>.</I>

A massive thrust to her slit,<br>
Brought a fart that should have been lit!<br>
"Oh pardon," she sighed,<br>
"It's nothing," he cried,<br>
"Most other girls usually shit."
<p>
"Your titties have cream," said Sir Lancer,<br>
"My hubby agrees," was her answer,<br>
But a medic named Brown,<br>
The new doctor in town,<br>
Said, "I think that likely is cancer."
<p>
<I>Connie Lingas is really working hard for the title of "Poster of the Most Disgusting Limericks"</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:Fantom3993@aol.com>John</a> shares a classic 06/26/97</h3>
There once was a man from milas<br>
Whose balls were made of fine brass<br>
One night in stormy weather <br>
They clanged together<br>
And sparks shot out his ass! 
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I really like this one"</i>
<p>
<I>The contest has seen many variations of this over the years.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Connie Lingas writes 06/26/97</h3>
There's a quiet bar by the pool,<br>
Where drinks are tall and quite cool.<br>
When a fag saw his friend,<br>
Seated down near the end,<br>
He said, "Dear, may I push in your stool?"
<p>
<I>Ewwww!</I>

Before you should venture to shack her,<br>
Or boldly try to attack her,<br>
Please don't be a bubba.<br>
Just reach for a rubba.<br>
You should first put a wrap on your wacker!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A message from the AIDS foundation."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:FLLW@aol.com>PoetLariat</a> writes 06/25/97</h3>
A lesbian, Ellen DeGeneris<br>
Was showing the world what her "tenor" is...<br>
With three friends, maybe four...<br>
They'll begin a "Toy Store"<br>
And I hear that they're calling it..."Men - R - US"!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Difficult to match the name with appropriate rhymes....and maintain the subject.....a Challenge....and fun.."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point is delighted when first lines catch fire.  The last really great one was "Desiring an unwrinkled scrotum".</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:highland@ncia.net>Mr. B  (Bob Leclerc)</a> writes 06/25/97</h3>
On the waves of the internet tide<br>
You can go for a digital ride<br>
And wash up on a shore<br>
To find a dead whore<br>
Or a cave with a hermit inside
<p>
You can read of a fellow named Dave<br>
With a corpse for a sexual slave<br>
You will see lots of shit<br>
Like a girl with one tit<br>
It's a ride for the bold and the brave!
<p>
<I>Not on the shores of <b>this</b> beach!</I>
<p>
Remember that man from Nantucket?<br>
He saved all his change in a bucket<br>
Then bought a machine<br>
To keep his tool clean<br>
But sometimes he still likes to suck it!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
"I can't keep a flame on my wick"<br>
Said the patient regarding his prick.<br>
"Quick fix my limp dickie -<br>
I'm late for a quickie!"<br>
"Here's tape and a popsicle stick"

A lesbian, Ellen DeGeneris<br>
Allows no man near her mons veneris.<br>
Her habits appear<br>
Decidedly queer,<br>
But with women she's surely more generous!

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/25/97</h3>
I wish you a quite happy life.<br>
Our affair has caused me some strife.<br>
Though you are now wed,<br>
May I come to your bed,<br>
If I get a signed note from my wife?

Those long lovely legs on Ms. Fitz<br>
I'd sure like to see where they quits!<br>
I know it's somewhere<br>
In a soft patch of hair<br>
Just north of the place where she sits!

Pickled pepper picker Peter Piper<br>
Pined to pack his pecker in a porker<br>
He poked a porker's pucker<br>
With his pepper-pickers pecker<br>
Now he's Peter Piper Porker Pucker Poker!
<p>
There once was a fella named Ryan<br>
To fuck him the young girls were dying<br>
But he made them all cry<br>
'Cause he passed them all by<br>
'Twas <em>guys</em> that this Ryan was eyeing!

<I>It happens...</I>

<h3>Connie Lingas writes 06/20/97</h3>
For all the girls, who are nifty,<br>
Here's plight of a lad called "Swifty,"<br>
His rod lacked the lubes,<br>
To penetrate pubes,<br>
So he used a bit of Slick-50!

Responding to <a href=#merritt2>Crazy Legs' question</a>,<br>

<h3>Shamelessly Borrowed shares a classic 06/19/97</h3>
Once a young lady begat,<br>
Triplets named Nat, Tat, and Pat.<br>
T'was fun in the breeding,<br>
But hell in the feeding,<br>
For she hadn't a spare tit for Tat!

Wanted sex, as did her sister, Sondra.<br>
Two under-achievers<br>
Obliged these two beavers.<br>
Would you call this a double ententre?

"So tell us, does size really matter?"<br>
Asked the boys during playful chit-chatter.<br>
"Any size, five to nine,"<br>
She answered, "is fine.<br>
I don't think I could take one that's fatter."
<p>

In the quaint little town of Mt. Troys<br>
Lived a mother who lost all her poise.<br>
She had but one tit<br>
And she cared not a whit,<br>
'Til the doctor delivered twin boys!

Og, your verses and heart both have <a href=#merritt>Merritt</a>,<br>
Now give us more lowdown, please share it!<br>
For instance, this knockout,<br>
When you take your cock out,<br>
Does she gleefully grin as you bare it?

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/17/97</h3>
"This rest room is just for the misses,<br>
As this is the place that they pisses."<br>
The matron did fret,<br>
"Now the floor is all wet,<br>
And this is because of near misses."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Let us spray."</i>
<p>
The sound of an "n" is in "knife."<br>
It usually causes me strife.<br>
In "pneumonia" it's dumb.<br>
We saw "gnaw", but how come?<br>
In English, this weird stuff is rife.

My vibrator's battery's dying!<br>
Can't fit new ones in, so I'm trying<br>
Two double A cells<br>
Hope they ring my bells<br>
But two D cells would be 'lectrifying!
<p>
"My lord" said the wench to her master<br>
"I'm floored by the stench of your ass, sir!<br>
You've promoted the fart<br>
Into museum art!<br>
It's adored!" said the wench.  So he gassed her.
<p>
So tell us, does size really matter?<br>
Would you rather it longer, or fatter?<br>
You know one size fits all<br>
When you're having a ball,<br>
So enjoy what I have, and be gladder!
<p>
<I>Thank you!  I like them too!</I>

<h3>Stabbe writes 06/16/97</h3>
A young little lady called Lucy<br>
Was inventive as ever a floozy<br>
A machine in her nose<br>
Cried "Oh, there she blows"<br>
On oral jobs in the jacuzzi!
<hr>
<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 06/13/97</h3>
At the toilet, Tom said with a grin,<br>
"My aim's not so good, hope it's in!"<br>
But it passed the bowl by<br>
And it dripped down his thigh<br>
Until Tom soaked his shin with urine!
<hr>
<h3>Lo and Behold writes 06/13/97</h3>
Al Willis' thesis re foo feces is nothing new<br>
As a classic, it's just airsick, change the pew<br>
Bird shitty's never pretty<br>
Pigeons on ledges dot the city<br>
From foo to screw, some hims and hers should clear the view.

Are those bountiful mammaries real?<br>
"Of course," the girl said..."Wanna feel?"<br>
"They're soft to the touch,"<br>
"But I wonder...too much,"<br>
"That I splurged on the three for one deal?"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/10/97</h3>
My joy is a soft little kitty<br>
To pet when I'm sad and quite shitty.<br>
Or a walk in the park<br>
Or the song of a lark,<br>
Or a young and tumescent big titty!
<p>
If there's shit on your hat, then declare it.<br>
As for me, I don't think I could bear it.<br>
It was dropped by a foo,<br>
(A big bird at the zoo,)<br>
And if the foo shits you must wear it.

<i>The poet comments, "How does Toast Point prevent duplications of limericks?"</i>
<p>
<I>He doesn't (except within the same month).  But if it's a dup of someone else's and is claimed as one's own, then obviously it's a "classic" and not an original.</I>

"Big breaths" said the good Doctor Rung.<br>
His stethoscope tested her lung.<br>
In all likelihood,<br>
She misunderstood.<br>
"Yeth, I've had them thince I was quite young."

<h3>Rowdy Jack shares a classic 06/10/97</h3>
Some NBA brass were debating<br>
A Text Viewer-14 for a rating<br>
Was it Rodman's wisecrack?<br>
"Not at all," replied Jack<br>
"It was Albert's request for fellating."

A limerick that's penned "squeaky clean"<br>
Oft results in its wit being lean<br>
So, please mention a prick<br>
And an over-sexed chick<br>
To ensure that your poem's obscene!

While thinking one day on the crapper<br>
Of gentlemen - handsome and dapper,<br>
At forty, unbrided<br>
Aunt Gertrude decided<br>
To go find a man to unwrap her.
<p>
Her plan was decidedly simple;<br>
She changed mini-skirt for her wimple.<br>
By showing some leg<br>
There'd be no need to beg;<br>
She'd just smile, so to show off her dimple.
<p>
On her first night out, Gertrude met Fred.<br>
He was older, but better than dead.<br>
But he wasn't too rich,<br>
And his eye had a twitch<br>
So he never got into her bed.
<p>
Gertrude's failure at first had her grievin'<br>
But she persevered 'til she met Steven.<br>
His hand stroked her breast,<br>
Her crotch he caressed<br>
And she said, "Now you've got me believin'!"
<p>
Gertrude said "I want more than just kissing;<br>
I want to know what I've been missing!<br>
I like to get stroked,<br>
But I'd love to get poked!<br>
Don't limit its talents to pissing!"

<h3><a href=mailto:700725@ican.net>Limb Rick</a> writes 06/07/97</h3>
Embarrassed I am of my weakness<br>
My salami is tragically meatless<br>
My girlfriend, to help<br>
Took my meat in her mouth<br>
And exclaimed "Here, let ME try to tweak this!"

Which Sue thought was quite dandy<br>
Until she found that the stick<br>
Was really Tom's big dick<br>
And his hands were a little too handy!

There was a young man of Nepal<br>
Who was born with a singular ball<br>
The sum of its weight<br>
Plus three quarters of eight<br>
Was three times the square root of fuck all.
<p>
There was a young girl from Pitlochry<br>
Who was having a screw in a rockery<br>
She said "Oh! You've come <br>
All over my bum - <br>
This isn't a fuck, its a mockery!
<p>
There was an old whore from Uttoxeter<br>
Who now, when anyone mocks at her, <br>
Recalls with a shiver<br>
One day by the river<br>
When twenty young men shook their cocks at her 
<p>
There was a young lady from Crewe<br>
Who remarked, as the Curate withdrew<br>
"The Vicar was slicker<br>
and thicker and quicker<br>
and three inches longer than you!"

I hardly think physics, per se,<br>
Could ever be classed as risque,<br>
But my girl has some MASS<br>
And some HEAT and some ass,<br>
So do not think this is hearsay.

Her lips were as pink as a rooster's dink,<br>
Her hair was horse-shit brown,<br>
Her tits hung loose,<br>

As she trucked all over town.

On the stairs at the back of the school<br>
He was giving his girl all his tool, <br>
When the bannister broke<br>
On the twenty-fourth stoke, <br>
And he polished her off on the newel. <br>
<h4> by A. N. Wilkins</h4>
<p>
Of all the world's verses recorded,<br>
The ones we've most carefully hoarded<br>
Are the limericks spun<br>
Which prove that the pun<br>
Is mightier, by far, than the sordid. <br>
<h4> by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
<p>
Through the woods young Red Riding Hood skipped,<br>
Till the wolf in his jaws had her gripped. <br>
"Now I'll fuck you," he said. <br>
"Nothing doing," said Red, <br>
"Just eat me and stick to the script." <br>
<h4> by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
<p>
There was a young fellow named Deke<br>

That produce ladies pants. <br>
I could pull down two hundred a week." <br>
<h4> by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
<p>
There once was a cuckold named Jack<br>
Whose wife showed in morals a lack. <br>
From a guy in a bar<br>
He once bought a used car<br>
And found her old panties in back. <br>
<h4> by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
<p>
"Please take off my dress," she begged thickly<br>
And my hose and my garter belt, quickly, <br>
Now my bra and my pants<br>
And for goodness sake, Lance, <br>
Your transvestite habits are sickly. <br>
<h4> by Bob Giandomenico</h4>
<p>

There was once a disgusting old trollop;<br>
From her nose hung a pendulous polyp; <br>
She had warts on her tits<br>
And a crotch full of zits, <br>
Round her waist, and incarnadine collop.     <I>(roll of fat)</I> <br>
<h4> by Ed Potts</h4>
<p>

You women, I fear it's bad news,<br>
I do not like feminist views; <br>
My ideal for feet<br>
Is a broad who's in heat<br>
And too horny to take off her shoes. <br>
<h4> by Ed Potts</h4>
<p>

A Sydney man peeped 'twixt her thighs;<br>
"Do I see her black panties?" he cries. <br>
"No bottom is bare --<br>
Perhaps I see hair?" <br>
Alas, in Australia, it's flies. <br>
<h4> by Ed Potts</h4>

His hand gave equal time each breast,<br>
His other hand her rear caressed. <br>
But when he felt<br>
Her sanitary belt, <br>
His eagerness grew less and less. <br>

My hand puppet gave me some sass.<br>
"Proctologists like you are crass!" <br>
I replied I was not. <br>

Your whole God-damned hand up my ass!" <br>

A bra could be called a tit sling. <br>

Just happened to be<br>
Invented by Otto Titzling. <br>

<p>

A Puritan Pastor whose life<br>

<h3>Rhubarb, flaunting the "No Dave" rule, sends a bunch of Dave variations from Pentatette</h3>
The lonely old outcast, Delanty,<br>

What I spent in a week<br>
Compared to a live one is scanty." <br>

A seclusionist kept in his hut<br>

My expenses are less, <br>

A reclusive old fellow named Lovell<br>
Kept the corpse of a slut in his hovel. <br>
He remarked, "I'll concede<br>
That it's partly from greed, <br>
But mainly for want of a shovel." <br>

Another old hermit named Mose,<br>
Was arrested for filthy old clothes. <br>
"They were left at my cave, <br>
By a neighbor named Dave," <br>
He testified, holding his nose. <br>

Now it's up to his ass. <br>
(His donkey, you censors: behave!) <br>

There once was a hermit named Ted<br>
Who kept a dead whore in his shed. <br>
She was covered with flies<br>
And had worms in her eyes, <br>
But at least she didn't have to be fed. <br>

There was a young man from LeHavre,<br>
Who cornered a lovely cadaver. <br>
And though our young Stanley<br>
Realized it unmanly, <br>
He knew when he wished he could have her. <br>

There once was a hermit named Ted,<br>
Who blew up a girl on his bed. <br>
Now she had just one tit<br>
And her pelvis was split, <br>
But they say she still gave him good head. <br>

There once was a hermit named David,<br>
Who kept a stiff tart in his cave, he did. <br>
He said, "I agree<br>
That it lacks comity, <br>
And it's not, I confess, for the pavid." <br>
<I>(pavid - showing fear, timid)</I>

A lonesome spelunker named Davy<br>
Made a solemn, guilt-ridden peccavi: <br>
My companion, now late, <br>
Was a Hertz Rent-a-date. <br>
But I'm happy, though ranty and ravy. <br>
<I>(peccavi - humble confession)</I>

There once was a woman named Kit<br>
Who kept a dead lover named Brit. <br>
I don't care if he reeks<br>
After all of these weeks, <br>
But I'm madder than Hell that he split! <br>
