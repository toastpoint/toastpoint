<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 06/30/97</h3>
For years in a place called Hong Kong<br>
The Brits and Chinese got along<br>
With no real democracy<br>
Until - oh, hypocrisy! -<br>
It was time for Great Britain's swan-song!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There once was a boxer called Tyson<br>
Who, in love or war, wasn't a nice 'un<br>
At the Fight of the Year<br>
He bit Holyfield's ear<br>
So hard, it needs surgical splicin'!

May good verse abound on this URL!<br>
A poem is much like a pearl<br>
It comes from your gut,<br>
It's beautiful, but<br>
A bad one can cause you to hurl!
<p>
The people will make hyperlinks<br>
To sites with sweet verses, methinks<br>
May each poem-lover<br>
A treasure discover<br>
And pardon this ode, if it stinks.

<h3>Mr Witty writes 06/29/97</h3>
Tennis? No, not in this dress!<br>
Said a guy suffering some stress.<br>
Tennis is for girls<br>
I'll just play with my pearls - <br>
If you ask me again, I'll say yes!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Where are all the Limericks by cross dressers?"</i>
<p>
<I>Probably in the <a href=naut697.html>naughty</a> section.  Everyone who enters that contest is a crossdresser.</I>

<h3>Mallik Bulusu writes 06/27/97</h3>
"It ain't half bad; but it ain't half good"<br>
For one to live like a dead wood..<br>
But, as it appears to me..<br>
To be or not to be?<br>
Varies as per his mood.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "TTT's comment is very good.....(Limerick too..)"</i>

<I>TP comments that he fixed the reference.  Thanks for letting us know.</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/26/97</h3>
Hypodermics are not any fun,<br>
Not even if stuck in the bun.<br>
My patience wears thin;<br>
They get under my skin.<br>
I'd rather eat squash with a nun!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wish I could  find a way to say "broccoli.""</i>

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A crashed Russian spaceship called Mir<br>
Will soon be abandoned, I fear<br>
'Cos each new cosmonaut<br>
Was so hurriedly taught<br>
That there's no one aboard who can steer!<p>
<I>Well, it looks like his crash-teaching was successful, actually...</I>
<hr>
<h3>Please Don't Call It 'Frisco... writes 06/25/97</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
CB found herself quite irate<br>
At Toast's color perception -- not great!<br>
"Our grass isn't brown,"<br>
She scolded, afrown --<br>
"It's Golden, like the Gate and the State!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I read your <a href=../travel/bayarea.html>travelogue</a>..."</i>
<p>
<I>There should be pictures, soon, too!  Not of the brown grass, though (and it was actually sort of an ecru, for you crossword puzzle fans).</I>
<hr>
<h3>Mallik Bulusu writes 06/25/97</h3>
At line one of this limerick, I had no clue<br>
What to fill in its line two - <br>
I managed to reach line three<br>
Before line four saw me in smiles and glee<br>
I finished the line five, I swear, it's true....

<p>
In Jerusalem there lived a guy called Eric<br>
Who just never cared for any ancient relic<br>
And never praised Gods<br>
Though, at times struggled with odds<br>
Just to prove that he is a maverick.
<p>
A gentleman from Duluth<br>
Always spoke truth<br>
So he never got into the claw<br>
Of the American law<br>
Cool, His life went smooth!
<p>
At times, to rhyme<br>
Is not a crime<br>
As you are not playing with swords<br>
But for arranging some words<br>
Like LIME, MIME and DIME...

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/25/97</h3>
My wedding will be in grand scale.<br>
Invitations are now in the mail.<br>
We have two weeks to wait,<br>
Just me and my mate,<br>
But the cake is getting quite stale!
<p>
<I>You think yours is stale, visit Miss Havisham sometime...</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:highland@ncia.net>Bob Leclerc</a> writes 06/24/97</h3>
If limericks were all that we said,<br>
And limericks were all that we read,<br>
What a world it would be<br>
For people like me<br>
With rhyming entrenched in their head!
<p>
My hopeful and humble behest<br>
Please post me right here with the rest<br>
I've polished my rhyming<br>
And metered my timing<br>
I think I can run with the best!
<p>
<I>Welcome aboard, Bob!</I>
<p>
That James is one hell of a guy<br>
He can look you right square in the eye<br>
And feed you his bull<br>
'Till you're really full<br>
'Cause he's mastered the art of the lie.

There once was a fly on a wall<br>
Whom brave Humpty Dumpty saw fall<br>
Down to save her, he leapt ...<br>
But that leap was inept<br>
'Cos he won't reassemble at all!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:tttom@usa.net>TTT</a> writes 06/21/97</h3>
There once was a king who was gamblin'<br>
His losses sent him a-ramblin'<br>

But still came short,<br>
And now he's sushi. (King Salmon)

No zebras did board Noah's ark<br>
Just horses, two white, and two dark<br>
But for forty black nights<br>
There were no bedroom lights<br>
Which caused zebras galore to disbark!
<p>
<i>Ever-so-slightly naughty, but we'll let it by...</i>

"I hate those snail darters," I cry.<br>
"And a minnow does not catch my eye.<br>
These wee, tiny fish<br>
Do not make a dish,<br>
And I know there are big fish to fry."
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 06/19/97</h3>
These are the Wrights from Kilkenny<br>
From the list, you can see there're not many.<br>
To show my intent<br>
This letter I've sent<br>
To my cousin, who hasn't found any!<br>

Ten eels drinking cocktails, conveys<br>
That they really like these soirees.<br>
They talk and they dance,<br>
And they kindle romance.<br>
And these we call social morays.

<i>The poet comments, "Pentatette published.  I got the idea from a cartoon."</i>
<p>

<h3>Lo and Behold writes 06/17/97</h3>
There was a young? lady from Midwood<br>
Who was quick to double-click when she could<br>
Alas her view, turned profile,<br>
Changed her cyber-junky smile<br>
Ere her Favorite Place be misunderstood
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "If you can't call, virus!!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Megarator writes 06/16/97</h3>
The shark, a misunderstood creature, <br>
Is less of a killer, more a teacher.<br>
'Nary a bone in its frame<br>
We should not defame<br>
Its toothy grin in our next creature feature.

<p>
<h4>A limerick saga about the Salvage Logging Act</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Congress did pass a decree<br>
That said "any sick or dead tree"<br>
Could be chopped with an axe <br>
And bought without tax <br>
By our friends the lumber companies
<p>
But now, here's the sinister trick<br>
Who's to decide which tree's sick?<br>
The Forest Service can mark<br>
Whole areas of any park <br>
Without threat from conservationist hicks!
<p>
The rights sold on the forest auction block<br>
of value which we can never fully take stock<br>
The highest bidder was free <br>
To log every tree.<br>
Only sick ones?  That was all just a crock.
<p>
Why would the NFS do this evil deed?<br>
The answer: corruption and greed<br>
since all dollars made <br>
from this unequal trade <br>
the departmental budget would feed.
<p>
But why Clinton would sign such a pact <br>
when Gore is known for environmental tact?<br>
makes no sense to me <br>
but now all can see <br>
he is by no means a Green Democrat
<p>
We all mourn our heritage lost <br>
And what gain was made for such cost?<br>
Campaign purses were fed <br>
by Special Interests in bed <br>
and the public's best interest got tossed.

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert>Professor M-G</a> writes 06/16/97</h3>
Though girls be more socially aesthetic<br>
Though oafish teen boys be pathetic<br>
Though Doc Skuse, to applause,<br>
Claim a chromosome cause ...<br>
Still, I cannot believe it's genetic!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "In last Thursday's issue of the science journal Nature, David H Skuse claimed, in effect, that
girls have greater social cognition than boys because a single X-chromosome gene is switched on
when the gene is passed from father to daughter, but switched off when passed from mother to son.
The report made front-page headlines in the British press, although many experts remain convinced
that nurture, not nature, is responsible for any difference in social skills between boys and girls."</i>

Cyberlim'ricker.calm wrote<br>
A curious silly short note<br>
For reasons unclear<br>
He typed it right here<br>
Just maybe he'll get the best vote!

<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 06/13/97</h3>
A very old etymologist from Calcutta,<br>
While making notes from pedantic data,<br>
Set aside his fountain pen,<br>
When instead of `wine & women',<br>
He came across `inebriant & inamorata'.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Is this a star-worthy limerick ?"</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point likes it, but the Sage fears that too many words don't match the metrical accents.</I>

<h3>Shakespeare's Younger Brother writes 06/13/97</h3>
Sir Winston, political star<br>
Could keep secrets, and so he went far.<br>
"I know that loose lips<br>
Can surely sink ships<br>
But they'll never let go my cigar!"
<hr>
<h3>Jeffery J. Cook writes 06/12/97</h3>
There was a young girl - call her Lily<br>
She was just a little bit chilly<br>
She sat on a heater<br>
To warm up her seater<br>
And said, "Gee, I look a bit silly".

While in China, my folks were agog,<br>
When they first heard this strange dialog:<br>
"Did you go to the store?"<br>
"No, I'll go about four,<br>
And after, I must wok the dog."

<i>The poet comments, "Was there a winner in the May contest?"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:neilf@cs.itc.hp.com>Limerick Man</a> writes Beatles limericks 06/12/97</h3>
Four more years we are getting from Bill.<br>
After eight years, we should have our fill.<br>
But with lawsuits to handle,<br>
And Whitewater's scandal,<br>
Perhaps there's a Fool On The Hill...
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Just making a little social commentary and incorporating the title
of a Beatles hit in the verse...
As long as I'm at it, I'll provide a few other examples:"</i>
<p>
<h4>A two-verse limerick</h4>
Here's a tale of a couple who met<br>
On a cross-country flight in a jet.<br>
She was gorgeous and single<br>
And she made his heart tingle.<br>
But their lives would be filled with regret...
<p>
As the story goes, she was a fighter.<br>
But the D.A. was slow to indict her.<br>
He was torn by his love<br>
And that one bloody glove...<br>
"This is GREAT," said the Paperback Writer!
<p>
A successful, young entrepreneur<br>
Saw his chance and was quick to procure<br>
The promotional rights<br>
For hotels and all flights<br>
On the Magical Mystery Tour.
<p>
As I hurriedly ate my fajita<br>
And I gulped down an iced margarita,<br>
Against time I was racing<br>
Or a fine I'd be facing<br>
From that meter maid called Lovely Rita.
<p>
Even though it's been years you've been gone,<br>
I'm still happy each morning at dawn.<br>
I could hope that you'd call,<br>
But I don't.  After all,<br>
Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, life goes on...

If you don't have the cash for a car,<br>
But you can buy a Cuban cigar,<br>
If all planes have a star,<br>
And great-grandad's a czar,<br>
You must be Back In The U.S.S.R!
<p>
Overseas, transportation's supplied<br>
Oft' by train, and for years they've relied<br>
On the railroads to carry<br>
Those who don't need a ferry.<br>
But you must have a Ticket To Ride.
<p>
The crocuses happily blooming<br>
Were all planted in dirt, I'm assuming.<br>
Else they'd never have grown<br>
Where their seeds were all sown<br>
And their ultimate fate would be dooming.

A pastor in need of a lawyer<br>
Was attempting to sue his employer.<br>
But the judge duly warned<br>
That if God became scorned,<br>
He'd be stopped at the Pearly Gate's foyer.

A pastor in need of some lawyers<br>

And down came the hail - <br>
Now his body is covered with sores

It doesn't ring a bell<br>
But along came a rabbit, and now where are it?

And played it o'er long<br>
And now in the dough they are dancin'!

A snowman named Frosty Van Pelt<br>
Would sleep where and whenever he felt - <br>
One evening, he chose<br>
To curl up on the stove<br>

I'm classed as an expert logician.<br>
I know physics and also cognition.<br>

<h3>Lo and Behold writes 06/05/97</h3>
Marilyn's lick about a lawyer in the foyer<br>
Is her first try, so she's just a wee bit coyer<br>
When she comes out of her shell<br>
Her lims will ring the bell<br>
As a voyeur. viewing Goya, you'll enjoy her

"Perhaps a wee bit crude?<br>
Would love to start a feud!"</i>

The crocuses happily blooming<br>
