Give money to them,<br>
Or a suitable gem,<br>
And a bonus for breast augmentation!

There was a young lass from Connecticut<br>
Who shoved a wazoo up her predicate<br>
His syntaxed infinitive fan-dangled<br>
Which caused his club and clauses to get strangled<br>
Her pronoun-ced sentence--100 laps of his scuttle-butt!

A wonderful thing is the limerick.<br>
But its consequence is a slimmer chick.<br>
For when she's in verse<br>
Her appetite's worse<br>
(Which also accounts for my slimmer dick).

And she said that nobody could screw her - <br>
Then along came Nick<br>
With a cast-iron dick<br>
And drilled a hole right through her!

Now French girls don't need Ph D's,<br>
If they have pretty breasts and cute knees.<br>
They don't know the word, "no,"<br>
And they love a peep show.<br>
The thing that I like are their oui's!

A cop, with his nightstick held firmly<br>
By a naked girl starting to squirm, he<br>
Ran his hand over her breast,<br>
And rasped, "You're under arrest,"<br>
Unless you suck off my "Officer Spermy."
<p>
Embarrassed I am of my weakness<br>
Of my pitiful wimpy assed geekness.<br>
Even so, I must brag,<br>
If my dick was a Nag,<br>
It'd run in the "pole positon" at The Preakness.
<p>
My goodness! Your pussy is gorgeous!<br>
Let me gaze at it a little more - just<br>
Spread your legs in the air,<br>
And I will just stare,<br>
And I promise I won't cause any more fuss!

<p>
The Pillsbury Doughboy's an anal emmission!<br>
I'm getting an oven powered by fission<br>
I'll throw him in the back,<br>
With a meat thermometer in his crack,<br>

With five pounds of ground beef and veal!

A cop, with his nightstick held firmly<br>
Wore gloves to eschew any germ he<br>
Might happen to get<br>
Should his nightstick get wet<br>
And contract a disease... epidermly.

A sextet of nymphs, and a satyr<br>
Got stuck in a small elevator<br>
But when rescued alive<br>
The nymphs numbered five<br>
Said the satyr: "The sixth one?  I ate her!"

It began with an offer of candy<br>
"I find your Mounds really dandy!"<br>
So the girl on the beach<br>
Gave him samples of each<br>
Which were yummy but just a bit sandy.
