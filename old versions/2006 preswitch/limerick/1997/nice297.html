<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 02/28/97</h3>
There once was a boy named Clack<br>
A clone of a guy named Click<br>
They expired in a fire<br>
But surrogates for hire<br>
Cloned Click and his Clack right back!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Is this sick or what?"</i>
<p>
<i>Hee hee.  Toast Point is reminded of a song from "Ten Percent Revue", 
in which a lesbian couple sing of their "turkey baster baby".  Whatever 
works, y'know?</i>

<h3>Squeaky writes 02/28/97</h3>
Oh, wise Sage, I fear I've made you tearful!<br>
My protest wasn't meant as an earful.<br>
Please forgive me this time<br>
And I'll send you more rhymes;<br>
Plus I'll be most eternally grateful.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, ":-)"</i>
<p>
<i>Oh, all right...</i>

I know I'm a mother adoring<br>
With stories most others find boring,<br>
But if your kids were like mine<br>
Your pride would soon shine<br>
And <i>I'd</i> be the one who was snoring!
<p>
I have a kitten named Fizzy<br>
Whose fur is so soft and so frizzy<br>
She's a little bit crazy<br>
And never is lazy<br>
And watching her may make one dizzy!
<p>
I have a job in which I must travel<br>
On long roads which are asphalt or gravel<br>
I go a long way<br>
And often I pray<br>
That I won't get slowed down by a gavel.

<h3><a href=mailto:youngcj@ix.netcom.com>Kats Klaws</a> shares a classic 02/27/97</h3>
T'was a favorite pastime of mine,<br>
A value of pi to assign,<br>
I'll fix it at three,<br>
For it's easier you see,<br>
Than 3.14159!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is the easiest way I've found to remember the value of Pi :)"</i>
<p>
<i>Hee hee hee!</i>
<hr>
<h3>Half Plume writes 02/27/97</h3>
There once was a grandma, so funny<br>
 Who had a granddaughter she loved to call 'Honey'<br>
 Grandma kept Honey amused<br>
 With laughter infused<br>
And she laughed until her eyes were runny!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'm the daughter of Monique de Plume, so this is for her.
 Take that..."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:pooh@itcanada.com>Sassy</a> writes 02/26/97</h3>
I once had a goldfish, Rene,<br>
Who was oft the light of my day,<br>
Wasn't it a pity?<br>
When my neighbor's fat kitty,<br>
Dined on my goldfish fillet?

<hr>
<h3>Squeaky writes 02/25/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Oh, an apple for some may suffice,<br>
But permit me to give my advice:<br>
Just a limerick a day<br>
Keeps the doctor away.<br>
No more pills, no more fruit;  you'll save twice!
<p>
A milkmaid addressing her cows<br>
Was intent that their style produce "wows!"<br>
But I say, "I'm amazed!<br>
Is this milkmaid just crazed?<br>
Or does everyone now clothe their cows?"
<p>
<I>The Sage sniffs tearfully and promises not to edit Squeaky's limericks again.</I>
<p>
<a name="dino2">"Well, perhaps it's your manners, "  I said,</a><br>
That caused us just to WISH you were dead!<br>
Or are all of your kind<br>
Quite so blatantly blind<br>
That you go around stomping on heads!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This limerick is an answer to a 
<a href=nice197.html#dino>very good limerick</a> 
by Agustin Eastwood De Mello." </i>
<p>

While browsing for relics historic<br>
A new wife became simply euphoric!<br>
For she'd seen an old  vase,<br>
And it lit up her face!<br>
(It was rubber-stamped "genuine Doric")
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Doric 'dor-ik adj. 1: of, relating to, or constituting Doric  2: of,
relating to, or characteristic of the Dorians  3: belonging to the oldest
and simplest Greek architectural order.  (the pun, of course, is that if it was "genuine" it would not be stamped
as such with a rubber-stamp)"</i>

"Can YOU get your checkbook to balance?"<br>
Asked a lass with blonde hair from New Palance.<br>
"Why is it every time<br>
I must calculate mine;<br>
Daddy has to send me more allowance?"

<h3>Anonymous writes 02/25/97</h3>
There was a young girl over seas<br>
Who ran out of water and cheese<br>
Her mom couldn't find her cat<br>
So she asked "where's it at"<br>
The girl smiled and said "pass the salt, please"
<p>
There once was a man from Bejing<br>
Who liked marriage, but not wedding rings<br>
He was in a state of dispair<br>
For he loved a girl named Claire<br>
Wo he proposed with an onion ring!
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 02/25/97</h3>
There once was a man from St. Keeth<br>
Who sat on his pair of false teeth<br>
he jumped up with a start<br>
And said "Lord bless my heart!<br>
I've bitten myself underneath!!"

<hr>
<h3>M. Layne writes 02/24/97</h3>
There once was a fellow named James<br>
Who liked to play games with the dames,<br>
But the dames all despised<br>
The games James devised,<br>
And they ended up calling him names.
<p>
There was a young fellow named Glen<br>
Who liked it again and again<br>
and again and again<br>
and again and again<br>
and again and again and again.

There once was a fella named Green<br>
Whose inventions you may not have seen--<br>
'Cause he was undone<br>
And all 'cause of one<br>
Dysfunctional flying machine!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ebradley@g-net.net>Earl R. Bradley</a> writes 02/23/97</h3>
Our leader of State, a far cry<br>
From those who before were so dry.<br>
She stuns all the brass<br>
As she sits on her ass<br>
And shows them her foot-wide thigh.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This was written in response to a picture on the front page of the Augusta (GA) Chronicle which shows her talking to the President of Italy. It was headed "Diplomacy Abroad". I copied it after I blocked out the "A"  and left it "Diplomacy Broad" I then passed it out at a club that I belong to."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:ahaghotu@fas.harvard.edu>His Peace</a> writes 02/22/97</h3>
"I hear there's a new kind of Barbie,<br>
Who's got her own apartment and car key<br>
And her own car that she can drive in<br>
And her own boyfriend named Ken!"<br>
"Big Deal! I bet he can't give her a baby!"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Wassup wit all de noise 'bout ebonics<br>
"If it ain't broke, it don't need to be fix<br>
Besides it's only a new language that's been made<br>
And it's not like we're even getting paid--<br>
What we really need's some phat ebonomics!
<p>
If you happened to be kicked out of school<br>
'Cos your teachers thought you were a fool<br>
But regardless of your lack of knowledge<br>
You still got into an Ivy League college<br>
Wouldn't you go back and let 'em know that you rule?!
<p>
They should really do something 'bout the NBA<br>
'Cos it's really getting boring, I have to say<br>
We all the know that the Chicago Bulls--<br>
With Michael Jordan who definitely rules--<br>
Can win any game they want any and every day!

I went to a computer club SIG.<br>
To my surprise, they were upgrading a pig!<br>
The poor hog was half alive,<br>
They had installed Windows 95,<br>
The new "Office", and a Bill Gates style wig!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:goldston@enssat.fr>Julupa</a> writes 02/21/97</h3>
Awarded a star for a limerick,<br>
Got choked up (but I don't know the Heimlich!)<br>
So I get the manoeuvre,<br>
From a woman named Hoover,<br>
Who saves lives with her twist-spit-puke magic.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
But her moniker, rhyme as it might,<br>
Harkens ghosts archetypal, a fright<br>
There was J. Edgar brownshirt<br>
And machines sucking down dirt,<br>
From which Hoover'd descended my sprite?
<p>
And darest one ask personal questions,<br>
Of one's savior, whose lifesaving lessons,<br>
Came free of genetics,<br>
And if not for phonetics,<br>
Her patronym may have been "Sessions"
<p>
Toast Point quotes Sondheim,<br>
<i>"I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hooooover, <br>
Gee, that was fun and a half - <br>
When you've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoooover,<br>
Anything else is a laugh!</i>

<h3>Bagwan writes 02/20/97</h3>
A milkmaid addressing her cows<br>
Gas given to wild, threatening vows<br>
She made them walk over<br>
To a field of fresh clover<br>
By calling them as "ignorant sows".
<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 02/17/97</h3>
Since "Star Wars" again started showin'<br>
Lucasfilm's bottom line has been growin'.<br>
Now, I may be amiss,<br>
But my question is this:<br>
Who's caring for poor Uncle Owen?
<p>
<I>Toast Point muses, "Last we saw of Uncle Owen, he was a smoking skeleton.  Maybe Luke keeps his bones around in a trunk."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 02/16/97</h3>

There once was a fella named Bill<br>
Whose girl was afraid of "The Pill."<br>
He said, "''Twon't make me ecstatic,<br>
But I'm not autocratic--<br>
If you just won't take it, I will!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Is this naughty or squeaky clean? What needs diluting most, the spice 
or the sugar?  Whatever!"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point couldn't tell either, and decided to place it in both sides.</i>

If the object of rhyming is pleasure,<br>
To the reader out searching for treasure,<br>
And a limerick suffices,<br>
To keep seeker from vices,<br>
Is it classified penance or leisure?
<p>
Of course writing in verse such a query,<br>
Poses problems of reference so scary,<br>
That the prospect might stifle,<br>
(Ontological trifle),<br>
Philo-poets with critiques to parry!
<p>
Then again, if this ditty gets posted,<br>
On the Web where such babble gets hosted,<br>
Cyber procrastination,<br>
Credit gleans as creation,<br>
"Here's to digital word games", we toasted!
<p>
<i>The Sage is awed.</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 02/13/97</h3>
My boss would often deride as only he can,<br>
"Hey, your limericks simply don't scan",<br>
Would receive over ethernet,<br>
Like most of them, yet,<br>
Would remark "This is out of ether, man!"
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Appreciation & Enthusiasm work as a charm,<br>
Together they do wonders with li'l or no harm,<br>
They come in a twin-pack,<br>
Like the pat on the back,<br>
Which gets translated to that shot in the arm.

<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> shares a classic 02/10/97</h3>
The old lion had shown speed and pluck,<br>
But still had been out of luck,<br>
Now smeared with mud, like a fool,<br>
He waited again near the pool,<br>
Wondering "So much for a fast buck!"

Robert Singer was a flamboyant V.P,<br>
Who had been invited over to H.P,<br>
His host, on his arrival late,<br>
Said, handing him a plate,<br>
"Hey R.S, you were supposed to R.S.V.P!"

While browsing for relics historic<br>
I found a book of rhetoric<br>
I flipped the pages without fear<br>
Of finding a lick of Shakespeare<br>
But alas, poor me, I found Urich!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Um, kinda rough, but I'm not used to the squeaky clean stuff yet."</i>

As he droned on Capitol Hill,<br>
We were all distracted from Bill - <br>
The verdict was in!<br>
OJ's guilty as sin...<br>
and he's in the hole for $8 mil!
<p>
The Gators haven't had much luck with Bowls<br>
But it was a grudge-match this year 'gainst the 'Noles<br>
That good 'ol boy Bobby<br>
Needs a new hobby<br>
Since we tore his boys some new holes!

<h3><a href=mailto:brickman.2@osu.edu>Stiffy Joe</a> writes 02/05/97</h3>
I'm drunk, yet continue to drink<br>
if I don't, what will everyone think<br>
I will lose their respect <br>
If their booze I reject<br>
I'll just smile and spew in their sink!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Mister Sage, sir.  Please give me feedback even if you don't enter this.
Thank you - Stiffy Joe"</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage informs SJ that he likes the limerick, although not the subject matter, and that 
everything gets entered, unless it's completely repulsive.</i>

I bought glasses to put on my face<br>
And it's true that they look out of place<br>
But they help me see better<br>
When I'm writing a letter<br>
Or counting from uno to tres!

My wife has reneged on her promise<br>
To take me down south to St. Thomas<br>
We got into a fight<br>
So she booked the next flight<br>
Now she's going with Fernando Lamas!
<p>
Enjoying banana-fudge sundaes<br>
Is what I do best on my Mondays<br>
For the rest of the week<br>
I become rather weak<br>
Waiting 'round for the day after Sundays
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A milkmaid addressing her cows<br>
Promised each one a series of vows<br>
She said that she'd never<br>
Be ever so clever<br>
As to try and milk one of the sows!
<p>
While browsing for relics historic<br>
I experienced a feeling euphoric<br>
It came upon slowly<br>
And made me feel lowly<br>
Viewing relics that were Theodoric
<p>

Can you get your checkbook to balance?<br>
Or make curtains including the valance?<br>
Can you sew your own clothes?<br>
Or even blow your own nose?<br>
Do you have any small hidden talents?

There was a girl from Timbuktu<br>
Who knew the things she knew<br>
She knew one thing<br>
To cook doughnut rings<br>
But even those were hard to chew!

<h3>D-Man writes 02/03/97</h3>
There once was a weird man named Sam<br>
Who ate nothing but Apricot jam<br>
'Til he stuck to the floor<br>
And could eat it no more<br>
So he switched over and only ate Spam!

Do I like those haikus? Oh yes, do I ever!<br>
They just need a thought and some wording that's clever.<br>
They need neither rhythm nor rhyme<br>
They require just a bit of your time.<br>
But give up on limericks forever? No never!
