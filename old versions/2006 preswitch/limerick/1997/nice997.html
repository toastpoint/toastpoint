Trees are dressed, lush in hue<br>
Till the wind rustles through<br>
Leaving all of them naked and sober.

Seventy years in the making.<br>
A marriage to have and to hold!

To quit, I know you can do it.<br>

Ain't saying it's breezy.<br>
But just get you some gum and chew it!

To 'The Valley' from the 'stix' we traveled.<br>

"See ya until"-<br>
"Goodbye roadkill"!<br>
I said as the map was unraveled.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Can you tell that I was ready to move?"</i>
<p>
There lives a family, Owen is their name.<br>

With lots of Mexicans in the town<br>

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "About a dog from our past."</i>

<i>The poet comments, "Missing an old friend."</i>

The time they turn royal blue<br>

So, laugh of you wanna<br>
Just give me the honor<br>
Of the prestigious "Golden Star" grade.

Started their cars and then took flight.

Had a chariot shiny and glossae<br>
When asked why the mess<br>
On the front of his vest<br>
"It came from the back of my hossae"

As a youngster, the guy would aspire<br>
To finagle and be the best liar.<br>
One day he got caught;<br>
He felt very hot,<br>
And he found that his pants were on fire!

<i>The poet comments, "Welcome home.  That tan is becoming...... pale."</i>

If only we scheduled more play<br>
We'd be more productive, I say<br>
'Cos all workers need rest<br>
To perform at their best ...<br>
Shouldn't every month have Labor Day?

<h3>Frank writes August 6</h3>
A huge, brightly colored balloon<br>
Soared aloft, one would think, for the moon. <br>
   To the passenger's fright<br>
   The gas failed to light, <br>
And the costly trip ended too soon.
<p>
Now they sip at the end of a flight, <br>
Some champagne, a balloonist's delight. <br>
   But that little band<br>
   Was so happy to land, <br>
They were glad to swig cola that night. 
<p>
<i>From the author: A Low flying hot air balloon almost landed in my yard, this
evening.</I>
