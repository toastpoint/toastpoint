A friend of mine pretends he is gay,<br>
When we rehearse in our school play.<br>
It really is sick,<br>
When he grabs my dick,<br>
But I often wonder, "What the HAY!!"

She used bleach on her cunt-hair to lighten it,<br>
And the cute see-through pants served to heighten it.<br>
But age took its toll<br>
On that high-traffic hole,<br>
And it's sad she had no way to tighten it!

A coffee grower named Hopp,<br>
Would take a bushel of beans from his crop,<br>

It was always good to the last plop!

A horny dentist known as McBride,<br>
Found a whore he wanted to ride.<br>

He folded it double,<br>
And instead of coming, he went!

And she kicked my hard copy<br>
My Lan, I was tempted to curse her!

Once there was a man named Wood<br>
Who screwed every woman he could -<br>
Once he had them all<br>
His dick began to fall<br>
And now his name is 'Could'.

With wide- open flies<br>
Until I met his best friend - Ryan!

Hell, I've even checked YOUR house!<br>
How hard-up can one fellow get???

An attractive young person named Fader, <br> 
Though psychiatrists struggled to aid her, <br> 
Believed that she was<br> 
A robot because<br> 
Her physics professor had made her.

An impotent Bishop named Clyde <br> 
Could never a woman bestride. <br> 
He said, "It's a sin<br> 
To shove that thing in!" <br>      
So he didn't, but God knows he tried!
 <p>
<i>by Laurence Perrine</i><br>
The nudists, by pure thoughts possessed, <br> 
Were gathered for prayer before rest. <br> 
But one wanton boy<br> 
Eyed his ravishing Joy, <br> 
And dreamed how she'd look fully dressed!
<p> 
<i>by Arthur Deex</i><br>
At a nudist camp outside Spokane, <br> 
The bride appeared wearing a tan. <br> 
There was no need to stare<br> 
To be fully aware<br> 
Of exactly who was the best man.
<p> 
<i>by Robin K. Willoughby</i><br>
As the feminist finished undressing, <br> 
She exclaimed, "Oral sex needs some stressing!" <br> 
She discovered the ratio<br> 
Of successful fellatio<br> 
To its counterpart, very distressing.

<i>by A. N. Wilkins</i><br>
When Lady Godiva last year<br> 
Rode her Harley through Coventry here, <br>

<i>by Thomas A. Quinine</i><br>
Between sports and cavorting with Nereids,<br> 
There are differences totaling myriads; <br> 
But the principle matter, <br> 
It is only the latter<br> 
Where there's play taking place between periods.

<h3><a href=mailto:tim@raptor.lpl.arizona.edu>Tim</a> writes 03/21/97</h3>
Desiring an unwrinkled scrotum<br>
He pumped up his sac till it hurt him<br>
With helium gas<br>
The stupid old ass<br>
He took off and I think he's still floatin'!
<p>
<I>Tim submitted these below in January, but they never appeared.  Toast Point has never seen them before, so there's a machine out there in the ether that's to blame.  There are more on the <a href=nice397.html>Squeaky Clean</a> side, too.</I>

You may well curse it and and moan<br>
But it has long been well known<br>
With its meter and rhyme<br>
And subject sublime<br>
That the limerick's the epitome of poem!
<p>
Some people find them quite rude<br>
With themes both earthy and crude<br>
But they are soon smitten<br>
Once one they have written<br>
And I'm sure you also will be wooed
<p>
So the next time you find yourself start<br>
To put down this venerable art<br>
Instead set your mind<br>
To creating a rhyme<br>
About a bishop who's eating a tart!

<h3>Cheeks writes 03/18/97</h3>

Your mother will cry<br>
As she looks at you in your grave.

On St. Patrick's, drink lots of green beer.<br>

Stumble around in a trance,<br>
Puke a bit, wet your pants,<br>
Be an asshole and do it again the next year!

Just to get in that hole<br>
You surrender control--<br>
(Of your life and your money?)  You betcher ass!

A guy and his girl left at noon<br>
To go off on a long honeymoon.<br>
Twelve-fifteen and he said,<br>
"Let's just stop here for bed."<br>
She smiled and she said, "Not a moment too soon!"
<p>
<I>The poet suggested that this might be <a href=nice397.html>squeaky-clean</a>, but Toast Point thinks this is the very definition of "naughty".</I>

A lady sadist was being quite fickle....<br>
"Should I stick a needle up this guy's dickhole,<br>
Or pour hot wax on his sack,<br>
Break his joints on the rack,<br>
Or probe his asshole with a sickle?"

Writerman, good luck in your <a href=#quest>quest</a><br>

At the last supper they gathered 'round Jesus.<br>

A hunter shot his silly ass dead!

All over my new, white dress .<br>
My girlfriend decided she would like to help,<br>
And as she yanked on my dick, I made a yelp .<br>
To have such a friend, one must be blessed .

If all is quiet and peaceful, God is taking a nap .<br>
If it's a rainy, stormy day, He's an angry chap .<br>
Bird poop isn't really bird poop, it's an angel's orgasmic sensation,<br>
And that's where we get hail, the naughty angel's castration .<br>
And if some asteroid happens to hit the earth, God is taking a crap .

His withered dick<br>
Ain't worth a lick<br>
And he wets his balls<br>
When nature calls<br>
So sex sith him ain't worth the prick!

Now words are a relative thing - <br>
They make many an argument ring<br>

From the asses of masses<br>
Called <I>flatulence</I> in a king?"

There was a young maid from New York<br>
Who dated a sailor from Cork<br>

She cried "Woe is me!"<br>

The waitress made so many spills<br>

Yet his butt cheeks did part<br>
And he let out a fart<br>
