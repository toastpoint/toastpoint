<h3><a href=mailto:ppipere@aol.com>Peter Piper</a> shares a classic 10/31/97</h3>
A Japanese whore showed affection<br>
To powerful men with direction<br>
Once while he was lovin' er<br>
She said to the governor<br>
"I'm working for your re-erection!"

Prince Charles and Parker-Bowles are such bores!<br>
Yet, after they fuck on all fours,<br>
Camilla lies back with relief,<br>
And lets loose a queef,<br>
That reminds Chuck of Mom when she snores.
<p>
<i>Toast Point confesses that he laughed out loud at this one.</i>

<h3>Sandyboy shares a classic 10/30/97</h3>
There was a girl from Clair<br>
Who possessed a magnificent pair<br>
Until one day <br>
They got stuck in thorn<br>
And began losing air!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sharing is Getting."</i>
<p>
When Roma was told about sex,<br>
She said "Mamma, it's so complex!<br>
You & father had to go <br>
Through all this trouble<br>
And I am just the side effect!"<br>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Live & Let live"</i>

<i>The Sage reminds the poet that limericks are FIVE lines long - see how they've been split now

There once was a girl named Delores<br>
Who sang in a 20-girl chorus.<br>
At the top of her slit<br>
Was a very cute clit,<br>
But I like to call it "cliTORis"!

Kathy Gifford has been in a stew --<br>
With her ex, she'll have nothing to do!<br>
So bid Ellen de Generis,<br>
Dreaming of her _mons veneris_,<br>
"Kathy, can I be Frank with you?"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Tasteless and insensitive, I know."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:brickman.2@osu.edu>Vinnie the Face</a> writes 10/27/97</h3>
My master persistently waited<br>
The faster his time was abated<br>
In spite of his aim<br>
The bus never came,<br>
The thrill of the ride left unsated.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:skink2@juno.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 10/25/97</h3>
When Rambo goes out in cold weather,<br>
He takes measures to be tough as leather.<br>
He fills his ass crease,<br>
With gobs of Bear grease,<br>
And staples his foreskin together!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Jack used to take Ken to the shore,<br>
And treat his cute butt like a whore.<br>
When screwing, he'd shout,<br>
(If Jack's dick would fall out),<br>
"Toto, I'm not in Ken's ass anymore!"
<p>
<I>The Sage tweaked it, just a bit, for metrical purposes.</I>

Sal Amander's a very nice fella.<br>
His parents are Johnny and Stella.<br>
Years ago, Dad proposed,<br>
And the bedroom door closed.<br>
And now he is called Sal Monella.<p>
This wee, bonnie, Irish young lass<br>
Was endowed with great tits and nice ass.<br>
But I had to leave 'er,<br>
That awful reliever,<br>
As she had a problem with gas!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There's a question designed to perplex:<br>
"Do you smoke at all just after sex?"<br>
"I ne'er undertook<br>
To take a close look.<br>
I'll just have to question my ex."

Young Gary plays mighty fine Gigs<br>
And whoips out some foot-stomping Jigs<br>
He'd be sharper than cactus<br>
If only he'd practice<br>
But he spends too much time rooting pigs!

<p>

limerick about me

<h3>Chips writes 10/24/97</h3>
A virgin named Maybeline Jones<br>
Introduced her sweet twat to the bone.<br>
It nicely surprised her <br>
When it slipped deep inside her<br>
And came when she started to moan!

This wee bonnie Irish young lass..<br>
Drank alone in a pub, alas!<br>
Enter Finnigan,<br>
Promised he'd make her grin,<br>
And I'm sure you can all guess the rest!
<p>
<I>This was also entered in the squeaky side - I think it deserves to be in both!  Squeaky, yet
naughty!</I>
<p>
There once was a Scot in a kilt,<br>
Who'd do any sheep that'd stand still,<br>
A Fleece he was shagging,<br>
Behind, his balls were dragging,<br>
And off went the sheep o'er the hill!

I want something new for my pleasure<br>
A pussy (convex ) I would treasure<br>
"I don't think they exist"<br>
Said Toast Point, sounding pissed<br>
"But I don't really know cause I'm gay, sir!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, ":)"</i>

Smegma's sebaceously cheesy<br>
The mere thought makes some people queasy<br>
"It's really not bad"<br>

"Although sometimes it can be quite greasy!"

<h3>Oddo Von Schlong flames Mind Crippler 10/23/97</h3>
A used up old whore named Whippler<br>
A notorious cheap liquor tippler<br>
While astride an old stump<br>
Taking a dump<br>
Gave birth to the poet Mind Crippler!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I use the term poet Veeerrry loosely"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Oddo Von Schlong writes 10/23/97</h3>
There once lived a man named Slade<br>
Who claimed he had never been laid.<br>
He had children in bunches<br>
And confirmed most folk's hunches<br>
That all of his kids were handmade!
<p>
A young pregnant woman named Mears<br>
Birthed a child that would bring you to tears - <br>
For out of her cunt<br>
Came a bow-legged runt<br>
With his ass between his ears!
<p>
Unfortunate timing had Alice<br>
With a vegetable substitute phallus<br>
'Cause she bought a large leek<br>
Which she promptly named Zeke<br>
Who rubbed on her clit 'til it calloused!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A late comer to September's challange"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 10/23/97</h3>
A girl who just couldn't be cuter<br>
Loved her cowboy and his 6-shooter<br>
But one day dumped him <br>
For a plumber named Jim<br>
When he doed her with his Roto-Rooter!
<p>
<i>Doed her?</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>Rick Limer</a> writes 10/22/97</h3>
Princess Di, in unfortunate place<br>
Paparazzi behind giving chase<br>
Said St. Peter in Heaven<br>
"You're number eleven,<br>
Before Enter, wipe big Merc off Face"

If I had a girl named Delores.<br>
Who was writing a limerick for us,<br>
She would rhyme clitoris<br>
With the words "hit or miss"<br>
And with bad rhymes she never would bore us!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Been away, but I'm back. Seems like everybody out there uses the
Seinfeld pronunciation...."</i>
<p>
<i>As opposed to the Pythonesque, I assume.  (Constable Clitoris?)</i><p>
There's a nip in the air, love, tonight.<br>
And that's really some pair, love. You're right!<br>
One is showing the cold<br>
With a nipple quite bold;<br>
And the left one is fairly uptight!<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Ufosyd@aol.com>Syd</a> writes 10/22/97</h3>
Why is that whip in your closet?<br>
I asked "the date" for this saturday night.<br>
He said, "If you get bored, we can play a game, is that alright?" <br>
I took down the whip, looked at it smiling, then snapped it at him.  <br>
He knew I was mad, knew I couldn't be had.I gave him a hair-whip-trim. 

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sometimes dumb, is fun. Sometimes, quaint- ain't. This little limerick is
about as bad as I can get. So next time I'll submit a poem with wit!!!"</i><p>
<i>The Sage comments, "And maybe following form as well."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 10/22/97</h3>
It's said (or so I have heard)<br>
That a woman's just like a dog turd<br>
The older they are<br>
They're easier (by far)<br>
To pick up - now ain't that absurd?!

<p>

There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
Is a pussy concave or convex?<br>
"It depends on position"<br>
Says a noted physician<br>
"And the angle of thrust during sex!"<p>
<i>Toast Point, despite his lack of experience with same, has trouble imagining a convex
pussy.</i><hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 10/22/97</h3>
If I had a girl named Delores.<br>
I'd build a big house in the forest, <br>
We'd make love every night, <br>
Under twinkling moonlight, <br>
And oh what a family'd flourish!
<p>
<i>Hardly naughty, but kinda sweet...</i>

<h3>Oddo Von Schlong writes 10/22/97</h3>
There's a question designed to perplex -<br>
Politically based and direct - <br>
Would the Turks really mind<br>
If attacked from from behind?<br>
And would Greece help to ease the effects?

There was a pig farmer named Gary<br>
When his sow's were in heat, wouldn't tarry<br>
Charlotte sure did protest<br>
When he fondled her breast<br>
And refused his proposal to marry<p>
Our Julie is somewhat unruly.<br>
An anarchist really and truly<br>
When her partner once said<br>
Please give me some head<br>
She gave him a whack in the goolies!

I have a fine cousin named Keith<br>
Who's a drunken degenerate thief<br>
He once drank from my glass<br>
Then he fondled my arse<br>
And left marks upon both from his teeth!

<i>The poet comments, "This was writtten in honour of "CyberCelt" who is also hoping to appear
on this page"</i>
<p>
I want something new for my pleasure<br>
Some new kind of sexual leisure<br>
For I'm sick of soft dicks<br>
And good-old-boy hicks<br>
Who usually have fuck all to measure!
<p>
I hear that your "thing" is tremendous<br>
In fact it is really horrendous<br>
If you don't mind a queer<br>
You can put it right here<br>
(As long as you promise to mend us)!

<p>
I once had a young girl named Julie<br>
Who made me go all hot and drooly<br>
My pacemaker slipped<br>
And my jeans nearly ripped<br>
When the feeling got down to my goolies.
<P>

<i>The poet comments, "For my partner!!"</i>

<P>I want something new for my pleasure<br>
Like a dog and a cat for good measure<br>
For I'm tired of young boys<br>
And my vibrating toys<br>
Which I usually use for my leisure.
<p>
I'm sick of young girls aged eleven<br>
Although they can take me to heaven<br>
But what really is bad<br>
And makes me so sad<br>
Is having to be in bed by seven!

<h3>CyberCelt writes 10/21/97</h3>
If I had a girl named Delores.<BR>
Whose cunt had a texture quite porous,<BR>
I'd smear her with lard<BR>
Then screw her real hard<BR>
With vaseline on her clitoris! <p>
<I>The poet comments, "had to change it coz i couldnt spell tyranasaurus ??????"</I> <p>
There's a nip in the air, love, tonight.<BR>
And if you will turn out the light<BR>
Please stoke up my fire<BR>
Arouse my desire<BR>
And then go down for a bite! 
<P>This wee bonnie Irish young lass..<BR>
Who came from Republican class<BR>
In the streets of free Derry<BR>
We all drink and be merry<BR>
You protestants can all kiss my ass !! 
<I><P>The poet comments, "Yeah!!!! Sinn Fein and the I.R.A for ever !!"</I> 
<I><P>Toast Point sighs, expecting a firebomb any minute.</I> 
<P>If I had a girl named Delores.<BR>
who closely resembled a walrus<BR>
first i'd file for divorce<BR>
then use physical force<BR>
and kick the bitch in the clitoris 
<I><P>The poet comments, "geez, they are getting pretty damn grubby now !!! sorry if anyone was
offended by that one"</I> 
<P>If I had a girl named Delores.<BR>
who knew every word in the thesaurus<BR>
i said, "if you're smart<BR>
Then suck on this fart<BR>
then she bolted, and spewed a great chorus.

I hear that your "thing" is tremendous - <br>
When erect, it is something stupendous<br>
But if I was impaled <br>
I'm sure you'd be jailed<br>
For my injuries most horrendous

I want something new for my pleasure<br>
So I bought a wee sheep for my leisure<br>
A donkey, a cow<br>
Some hens, and a sow<br>
Then a ten-dollar whore for good measure!

<i>The poet comments, "woo hoo I'm on a roll now !!"</i>
<P>
There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
And it springs to mind when I have sex<br>
I once bonked a giraffe<br>
For a bit of a laugh.<br>
Is it o.k to shoot on their necks?

THere was a young fellow named Keith<BR>
who circumcised men with his teeth -<BR>
it was not for his leisure<BR>
Or sexual pleasure<BR>
But to get at the cheese underneath! <p>
There was a young fellow named Buckingham<BR>
Wrote a book about women and fucking'em<BR>
But a clever young Turk<BR>
Eclipsed this great work<BR>
