<h3><a href=mailto:c_mahler@hotmail.com>Courtney Mahler</a> writes 10/31/97</h3>
Tonight I'm a witch and I'm ready to leave,<br>
I'm going trick or treating on All Hallow's Eve.<br>
I'm gonna' have fun and I'm not gonna' get scared,<br>
And all this candy I get, it's not gonna' get shared!<br>
But the downside is that all the candy I get, I will have to heave!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mypoet@aol.com>Treva Myatt</a> writes 10/30/97</h3>
There once was a farmer from Maine<br>
Who left his cat out in the rain;<br>
It snarled and hissed,<br>
It really was pissed,<br>
It chased field mice INTO the grain!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 10/29/97</h3>
In Paris, a man named Jerome<br>
Works in subways real close to his home.<br>
He's like a dwarf, too,<br>
At four foot and two,<br>
And most people say, "Metro gnome."

There's a question designed to perplex:<br>
Why giraffes have such very long necks!<br>
Is it mainly to see?<br>
Or eat treetops for tea? ...<br>
Or have more room in dating for pecks?

My heart isn't made of dark stone,<br>
And I don't speak in very harsh tone,<br>
But I think it'd be neat,<br>
When kids trick or treat,<br>
If they'd please leave my mailbox alone!
<p>
It ain't nice to get kid's hopes dashed,<br>
We've oodles of giveaways stashed,<br>
Halloween's fun<br>
Save for "Peeve One",<br>
Getting my mailbox all smashed!<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Happy Halloween, Eric!"</i>
<p>
<i>Thanks, Chris!  Hope you've been well!</i>

<h3>Chaplin Coleman writes 10/29/97</h3>
There once was an old sow<br>
Who wanted to marry a cow<br>
But his own kind<br>
Bit him on the behind<br>
And he's six feet under now!
<p>
There was a pudgy cat<br>
Who sat on a little rat<br>
The rat was squashed<br>
The spot could not be washed<br>
Now it's under a floor mat!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:njackson@beeld.com>Laughing Stock</a> writes 10/28/97</h3>
On the southern tip of Africa lies Cape Town.<br>
Many people think it's a great town,<br>
But take away the sea<br>
And what would it be?<br>
Nothing but a silly old _ape town.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This one works better when you hear it than when you read it. In written
form the pun C/sea doesn't work so well."</i>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 10/28/97</h3>
My advice, just forget that it's fun<br>
To think that you could be the one<br>
That this country needs<br>
To do its misdeeds,<br>
And then change your plans and don't run.

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 10/27/97</h3>
I scooped out the flesh of a pumpkin<br>
I carved on the face of a bumpkin<br>
Went disguised to my folks ...<br>
They at once saw my hoax ...<br>
Moral: try as you might, you can't stump kin!

The World Series ends in Miami<br>
Those Florida Marlins are jammy!<br>
They just squeak to a tie<br>
On a sacrifice fly<br>
But in OT, sock Cleveland a whammy!

<h3>PJ :) writes 10/25/97</h3>
There once was an Internet spamster<br>
Who was told,"You're really a tramp, Sir!<br>
With your morals decayed,<br>
Millions of  ads you have laid...,<br>
We curse you with ill to be damned, Sir!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 10/25/97</h3>
Halloween's when ghosts party together<br>
Scaring witches and cats in bad weather<br>
The witch howls, the cat mews<br>
Ghosts get high on their boos<br>
And return home dead drunk to the Nether.

There's a new phrase I wish would go dance - <br>
I would ban it, given just half a chance<br>
So, if you ask me a favor<br>
Be a gratitude saver -<br>
Don't bug me with "thanks in advance"! 
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sound familiar? The version I submitted on 10/20 had two really dud
middle lines (so bad, apparently, you changed "favor awaiter" to "favor a waiter" in a futile
attempt to make sense of them) ...  so I've changed them."</i>
<p>
<i>Definitely an improvement, although "go dance" is still a stretch...</i>
<hr>
<h3>Al Willis writes 10/25/97</h3>
It is said Mr. Gore is a bore.<br>
His drone causes many to snore.<br>
All those Sammies and Tammies<br>
Get into their jammies,<br>
And some fall asleep on the floor.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There once was a hacker named Cyrus<br>
Whose computer developed a virus.<br>
To get some surceases,<br>
He chopped it to pieces<br>
And went back to using papyrus!
<hr>
<h3>Alby writes 10/24/97</h3>
A squeaky clean limerick you ask?<br>
For me this could be quite a task!<br>
But I'll try to conform<br>
And hope you don't yawn<br>
At the boring mind-numbing remarx!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "well what do you expect from a first timer!"</i>
<p>
My experience is quite undeniable<br>
You see I have none and that is why-able<br>
I will try to improve<br>
And practice my move<br>
From basic to experienced limerickables!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "i dont think this earns the right to a comment ...does it?"</i>
<p>
<i>Ooo, Alby, you do so well, and then your 5th line rhyme falls flat.  Keep plugging away,
kid!</i><hr>
<h3>Mathman writes 10/24/97</h3>
Baseball caps are made for clinging<br>
When after fly balls you're winging.<br>

Only by boors<br>
And those with a poor upbringing!

But I will not admit<br>
That my underwear ever is dirty.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Rosiebunny@juno.com>Kitty Kat</a> writes 10/24/97</h3>
My best friend is always clean<br>
Too bad she's sometimes mean<br>
I wish she was nice<br>
Even to little mice<br>
Maybe I can change my name to Sheen!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I just want to say that in the limerick,when it say "Maybe I can change my
name to Sheen" it means I'm too humilated to be seen with her. "</i>

There's a bug in Excel, quite a beaut<br>

By more, than providing<br>
The answer is always a noot

I'm not a believer in fate<br>
But if Gates were to reincarnate<br>
He'd return as a nun,<br>
Attila the Hun,<br>
Or as Alexander the Grate!

At school I was sometimes befuddled<br>
My grades most got halved and not doubled<br>
My Inglish you see<br>
Was my downfall from 3<br>
'Cause my words I got always up muddled

There once was a man named Crocket<br>
Who put his foot in a socket<br>
When along came a witch<br>
Who turned on the switch <br>
And Crocket went up like a rocket
<p>
Way down south where bananas grow<br>
A grasshopper stepped on an elephant's toe<br>
The elephant  said with tears in his eyes<br>
Pick on someone your own size!<p>
I asked my mom for 25 cents<br>
To see the elephant jump the fence<br>
He jumped so high <br>
He reached the sky <br>
And never came back till' the forth of July!<hr>
