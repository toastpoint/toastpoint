So I gave you the Chocolates from Dove.<br>

And pushed me away with a shove.

Now a Mom of laborious girth<br>
Plans to share her contractual mirth<br>
She'll play poker, I read<br>
While her doctors proceed<br>
With what's virtually internet birth!

Oft while driving from home to the lab<br>
With the news read, I take a first stab<br>
At a limerick -- which po'm<br>
Oft improves driving home ...<br>
But at other times calls for rehab!

<h4>Ed Wood</h4>
Ed Wood (or his ghost)  has returned to produce<br>
A musical dealing with childhood abuse.<br>
Through dancing and song,<br>
You'll learn what went wrong<br>
And WHY Dave, The Hermit, became a recluse.
<p>
Ed Wood did so many things wrong:<br>
In movies, in drama and song.<br>
His musical worst<br>
Was Catherine the First,<br>
With "Kate" sung by Anna May Wong.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ed Wood, Director and Screenwriter, notorious for producing bad movies 
in the 50's and 60's, died in 1978.  The movie, "Ed Wood", starring 
Johnny Depp, was  wonderful comedy about this eccentric charcter."</i>

He awoke with a fright<br>
To a terrible sight<br>
And found it was perfectly true!

The storm at my window is nigh<br>
As thunderheads rattle the sky<br>
Celestial strife,<br>
Like an echo of life,<br>
A chaotic, cacophonous cry.

Now Afghanistan's recent earth quake<br>
In a cross-border bomb trial's wake<br>
Make's one ask if land slide<br>
And blasts just coincide --<br>
Or if cause and effect are at stake!

An anthropologist known just as Jim<br>
Said the Irish have always been dim<br>
But as for the Welsh<br>
They’re nothing much else<br>
Than Irish, that just learned to swim!
