Little Monica Lewinsky<br>
Got a dribble or two on her chinsky.<br>
Now Bill's in hot water,<br>
As quite well he oughter,<br>
For giving her the ol' out and insky!
<hr>
<h3>Moony shares a classic 01/31/98</h3>
There was a young man from Kent<br>
Whose tool was unusually bent<br>
To save himself trouble<br>
He stuffed it in double<br>
So instead of coming he went!
<p>
Mary had a little lamb<br>
She couldn't stop it gruntin'<br>
So she tied it up <br>
To a five-barred gate<br>
And kicked its little cunt in.
<p>
<i>How does one kick in something that's already concave?</i>

<h3>Teresa writes 01/30/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I dated a guy with two dicks.<br>
One small, one quite long and thick.<br>
The small, hard as wood...<br>
The large tasted good -<br>
So it sure wasn't easy to pick!
<p>
I've heard that eunuchs are in -<br>
They're not either women or men.<br>
But I love big dicks<br>
And balls I can lick,<br>
So boys without toys seems a sin!
<hr>
<h3>Wildman writes 01/30/98</h3>
A pervey young fellow named Tanna<br>
Perverted an orangutan, Hannah.<br>
But he lost his thing<br>
When that old orang<br>
Peeled and ate Tanna's banana!
<p>
A pervy young fellow named Wayne<br>
Had a monkey he kept in a cage.<br>
He stuck in his dick,<br>
(Thought the monkey would lick)<br>
But the monkey just laughed at his thing.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "How about some pervy young fellow limericks from the crowd??"</i>

She said that she'd come to my house.<br>
So I started to work on her blouse.<br>
She said, "Be my tutor,<br>
And teach me computer."<br>
And I said, "Well, look, hold this mouse."
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:DSHAW10156>Waukesha Don</a> writes 01/29/98</h3>
He met her at a local bar<br>
He took her home - it wasn't far<br>
He gave her some gin<br>
And said with a grin<br>
My "hotrod" isn't a car!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 01/29/98</h3>
The first thing Bill said without doubt(h)<br>
About Monica and goings on 'down south'<br>
Unwittingly audacious<br>
In a manner loquacious<br>
"Ahh! Now the tart opens her mouth!"
<hr>
<h3>Commandante X shares a classic 01/28/98</h3>
There once was a girl from Peru<br>
Who didn't have nothing to do<br>
So she sat on the stairs<br>
And counted cunt-hairs<br>
Four thousand, six hundred and two!
<hr>
<h3>Moony shares a classic 01/28/98</h3>
There was a young lady named Pymm<br>
Who had a remarkable quim<br>
It wasn't the size<br>
That attracted the flies<br>
But the crystallised piss 'round the brim!
<hr>
<h3>Moony writes 01/28/98</h3>
There was a young lady called White<br>
Who lived on used condoms and shite<br>
The rubbery bits<br>
Were as tough as old tits<br>
But the goo left inside was alright!
<p>
<i>Ewwwww....</i>

If true (and, like the press, I'm just gropin')<br>
Then Bill Clinton will surely be hopin'<br>
That Monica, the slut<br>
Will keep her mouth shut<br>
When, previously,  she'd kept it wide open!

<h3>Jeeves writes 01/27/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
A mutant of nuclear war<br>
She had two pussies, I swear<br>
Though neither had hair<br>
And a tongue that hung down to the floor!

<h3>CB writes 01/27/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The White House is under great stress<br>
From the salacious Monica mess.<br>
Bill would put out the fire --<br>
Easy, call her a liar --<br>
Except for the stain on her dress...
<p>
Mean-spirited old Kenneth Starr<br>
Now gleefully lights his cigar --<br>
He's positively gloating<br>
From all the Deep Throating --<br>
But I think he's gone much too far...
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:hmyers@globalnet.co.uk>FCA</a> writes 01/27/98</h3>
A gay lost his boots in a game...<br>
And returned to his home full of shame.<br>
"Lost my tackle" , he groaned<br>
To his partner who moaned<br>
"Our relationship never will be the same"!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 01/26/98</h3>
A vibrator cannot lose erection.<br>
And you can dispense with protection.<br>
But if batteries fail<br>
You must look for a male.<br>
It can cause a girl's utter dejection!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 01/26/98</h3>
Bill says there was no penetration,<br>
But Monica says, with elation,<br>
"He wanted me bad,<br>
So I said 'don't be sad, <br>
We'll just cure all your ills with fellation!'"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "And he didn't inhale, either!"</i>

<h3>Ashamed O'Myself writes 01/25/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a man from Quebec<br>
Whose tool wasn't quite up to spec<br>
Though he blamed the ill-fit<br>
On the gals he was with<br>
All the gals called him "Too-Loose Letrec!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ever seen this before?  
Maybe I just recalled it from the deep, dark depths of a faulty memory."</i>

Said the co-, "And the widest one too!"

They played "Stormy Weather"<br>
And lighting shot out of his ass!

<h3><a href=mailto:hmyers@globalnet.co.uk>FCA</a> writes 01/24/98</h3>
Linda Tripp says "It couldn't be ironicker<br>
That Slick Willy could end up like Honeker.<br>
I've now blown the whistle<br>
On where he's put his gristle<br>
And been blowing , not sax , but our Monica!"
<p>
<i>Toast Point thought that in this case, <b>Bill</b> was the sax!</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 01/24/98</h3>
As we stood there, she said, "Why not neck?"<br>
(This very tall gal from Cal Tech.)<br>
Her legs were widespread<br>
So I went straight ahead.<br>
And I'm built like Toulouse-Lautrec!

<h3>OrlandoJoe writes 01/24/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There was a young lady named Monica<br>
Who played a penis just like a harmonica<br>
'Til near Capitol Hill <br>
She played one named Bill<br>
And the notes could be heard in Salonika!

<h3><a href=mailto:ekkalldway@aol.com>Lord DeathSpawn</a> writes 01/23/98</h3>
There once was a milkmaid from Tull<br>

His daughter was milking the bull!!!!

<h3>Crazycunt writes 01/23/98</h3>
There was an old man of old<br>
Who did what was expected when told, <br>

A gay lost his boots in a game...<br>
Then his shirt and his shorts just the same.<br>
"Seen my tackle ?" , he sighed<br>
To the ref who replied<br>
"Yes I have - a nice set - what's your name !"

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
Who had triplets (that's twins plus one more).<br>
On each side, Nat and Pat<br>
Were contented and fat --<br>
It was Tat who the spare tit was for!
<p>
<i>Marvelous adaptation of a classic joke!</i><p>
Politicians, it seems, always knock...<br>
They just knock around watching the clock,<br>
Then knock off at two<br>
To knock down some brew,<br>
And go knock up the girl down the block!
<hr>
<h3>Wildman writes 01/22/98</h3>
On Saturday night, up on Mars..<br>
Met a girl who wasn't too sharp.<br>
She asked me if I<br>
Would take her for a ride,<br>
But Mars ain't got any cars.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Wait a minute..............!"</i>
<p>
"Disposable condoms", you see<br>
Sounds kinda redundant to me.<br>
'Cause when you use those<br>
Of course you dispose....<br>
'Cause who would keep such a thing?
<p>
A hillbilly from West Virginia<br>
Ain't likely to be joining MENSA.<br>
His IQ is listed<br>
In negative digits<br>
He can't buy a clue, or even rent some.
<p>
<i>The Sage warns Wildman to tighten up his rhymes, or risk a flogging.</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Disposable condoms? Not me!<br>
Those things fit too snugly!<br>
Some guys have a twig,<br>
But mine is so big<br>
It's more like the trunk of a tree!<p>
I once met this three-breasted whore<br>
I sucked till all three were sore.<br>
Then I went south,<br>
Got her off with my mouth,<br>
Then I sucked on her titties some more!
<p>
How he cried when he lost the election..<br>
He couldn't take the rejection.<br>
He showed 'em his hose,<br>
But he wasn't chose<br>
As President Of Big Erections!

<h3>Jeeves writes 01/21/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
West Virginia is now my home state.<br>
Be considerate before you berate - <br>
Madams and Misters - <br>
We don't marry our sisters<br>
Though sex with 'em sure can be great!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "...dueling banjos play in the background..."</i>
<p>
Disposable condoms? Not me!<br>
Said John Bobbitt, all melancholy<br>
I don't need 'em no more<br>
Cause Lorena, the whore<br>
Made a damn eunuch of me!
<hr>
<h3>Blowcephus writes 01/21/98</h3>
Politicians, it seems, always knock...<br>
Sex, alcohol, drugs, and rock.<br>
But tobacco is fine,<br>
And so's beer and wine,<br>
And they'll rock any gal who likes cock!!
<p>
On Saturday night, up on Mars..<br>
Met an alien girl in a bar.<br>
But I ran like mad<br>
When I saw that she had - <br>
A collection of dicks in a jar!
<p>
The Clintons have spent all the dough...<br>
Because of that slut, Paula Jones.<br>
She might have been worth<br>
What she asked for, at first,<br>
If she only was willing to blow!
<hr>
<h3>Niteeyez shares classic something-or-others 01/21/98</h3>
She was coming around the mountain.<br>
Doing 90 miles an hour.<br>
When the chain on her bicycle broke<br>
They found her in the grass,<br>
With a sprocket up her ass.<br>
And her tits mangled in the spokes!
<p>
First Marine he found the bean Par`Le vous<br>
Second Marine he cooked the bean Par`Le vous<br>
Third Marine he ate the bean<br>
And shit all over the submarine<br>
Par`Le-Par`Le-Par`Le vous.
<hr>
<h3>Moonman writes 01/20/98</h3>
A chappie from old Cullercoats<br>
Would screw weasels and hedgehogs and stoats.<br>
This predisposition<br>
For furry coition<br>
Led to anal insertions in goats!

She spoke with loquacious complexity<br>
That left men in a state of perplexity<br>
So they sought with depravity<br>
Her lower concavity<br>
And her chest of enormous convexity!
<p>
<i>Toast Point is in awe of the poet's immense...vocabulary.</i>
<hr>
<h3>Sarita Montial writes 01/19/98</h3>
How he cried when he lost the election..<br>
Cried and cried till he had no erection.<br>
So he took Paula Jones<br>
Shook her all to the bones,<br>
And since then, she enjoyed his protection!

A gay lost his boots in a game,<br>
And everyone said, "It's a shame."<br>
The faggot was bootless<br>
The boots were quite fruitless,<br>
So he borrowed some shoes from a dame!

<h3>Pruman writes 01/17/98</h3>
There was a young trollop called Prue<br>
Who ran a "tea shop" down at Kew.<br>

And taught me a trick that she knew!

A mouth on all breasties,<br>

Was it Pine or a Fir ?<br>

I can't write an unnaughty limerick<br>
I have to mention pussy or dicks or tits<br>
I have to say FUCKING<br>
Or tell of some SUCKING<br>
Or else what's the point of doing this?

<i>Ah, that's the challenge of the Squeaky-Clean section...</i>

A Tennessee woman went sailin'<br>
Near Nashville with Willie and Waylon<br>

Till both ol' outlaws<br>
Got down and did 'em some nailin'!

Who was more into suckin' than fuckin'.<br>

He sang with a jig,<br>
"The turd is so big<br>
It just wouldn't go down with one flushing!"

I know a young girl from Little Rock<br>
Who sucks and fucks big and little cocks.<br>
You can't forget Sherry,<br>
Her pussy's as hairy<br>
As those bearded rockers, ZZ Top.
<p>
A couple hot honeys from Texas<br>
Said "Your attitude does perplex us...<br>
We don't want a gentleman,<br>
Just a top or a bottom or a middle man,<br>
And who cares who thinks that is sexist!"

My girlfriend's from Arizona<br>
She appreciates a good boner.<br>
The day that we met<br>
She hadn't fucked yet,<br>
So it didn't take me long to get on her.

I know a young girl from Nebraska.<br>
That bitch is as cold as Alaska.<br>
Her pussy is drippy<br>
As the great Mississippi,<br>
But she sure loves to fuck, so go ask her!
<p>
I once met a girl from Nebraska,<br>
Her ass was as large as Alaska.<br>
The dress that was on her<br>
Could hide Arizona<br>
And it took me a week to get past her!

I once met a girl from Nebraska,<br>

A woman I know from New Hampshire<br>

While visiting Santa's North Pole<br>
I took out a big joint to roll<br>
Smoked half with an elf<br>
Who I bonked on the shelf<br>
Both made the poor bastard's eyes roll!

I know just what I want for my present!<br>
It's something quite smutty and pleasant<br>
My God no, you fool<br>
It's not your big tool<br>
But a twat which is quite effervescent!

We gay boys can make Christmas merry!<br>
By dressing up like a wee fairy<br>
And using a boy<br>
As our sexual toy<br>
More fun than a hymen or cherry!!
