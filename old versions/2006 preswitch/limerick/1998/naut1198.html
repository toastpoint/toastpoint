<h3><a href=mailto:skink@mindspring.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 11/28/98</h3>
Jesse Helms was consumed with lust:<br>
He said, "I shouldn’t beat off, but I must!"<br>
Though shriveled and teeny,<br>
He wanged his old weenie....<br>
‘N When he came, his pecker shot dust!
<p>
<i>Toast Point once saw a comedian who commented that George Bush was so dry, he came in 
a puff of powder too!</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:skink@mindspring.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 11/28/98</h3>
A hot girl I know named Rose,<br>
Likes to wear some very tight clothes.<br>
What her pants do to her crotch,<br>
Can be inspiring to watch,<br>
If you happen to like Camel Toes.

<hr>
<h3>John Saugen shares a classic 11/27/98</h3>
There once was a lady named Dot<br>
Who lived off of pig shit and snot.<br>
When she could not get these<br>
She ate the green cheese<br>
That grew on the inside of her twat.
<p>
<i>This is so close to the green meat limerick that Toast Point may ban this one as well.  Yuck!</i>

<h3>Observer writes 11/26/98</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a fellow named Buzz,<br>
Whose bald head was covered with fuzz,<br>
Said his best friend, McNutt,<br>
"It feels like my wife's butt."<br>
Said Buzz, "It most certainly does"!
<hr>
<h3>KaMotion3 shares some kinda poemic classics 11/24/98</h3>
Here's to the bulls that roam through the woods.<br>
Doing the cows and the cattle good.<br>
For if it weren't for those bulls and their little red rods,<br>
There wouldn't be any meat around here by God! <p>
Here's to the bees those busy little souls,<br>
Who don't believe in birth control,<br>
For if it weren't for times like these,<br>
There wouldn't be so many of those "sons-a-bees"<p>
In days of olde and Knights were bold,<br>
Before rubbers were invented,<br>
They slapped a sock around their cock,<br>
And babies were prevented !
<p>
<i>KaMotion, sweetie, these are cute, but they're not limericks.</i>

A warm puff of intestinal air,<br>
Ruffled his dear lover’s hair!<br>
He said, "Excuse my ass belching,<br>
Please, go on with your felching,<br>
You suck an ass with such flair!"

<h3>CyberCelt writes 11/21/98</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Why Monica, love your blue dress!<br>
Spread your legs for a frontal caress!<br>
I can't get a boner<br>
So I'll use this corona<br>
Oh! and darling, please clean up the mess!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:RBoyte7293@aol.com>RON BOYTE</a> writes 11/20/98</h3>
Why Monica, love your blue dress!<br>
But what of the rest<br>
Bill is in the back<br>
Hiding his face and his disgrace<br>
Smoking with his wife.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "THANKS!!"</i>
<p>
<i>Ron... sweetheart... check out the <a href=docs/formhint.html>Hints on Limerick Structure</a>.</i>
<p>
If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
There  wouldn't  be  much  left  to  say<br>
He'd  probably  curse<br>
And  make  such  a  fuss<br>
That  the  government  would  put  him  away

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "THIS IS FUN!!!"</i>
<p>
A nubile young Finn who went skiing<br>
Saw her  dear  friend  just  a-peeing<br>
She  turned  up  her  head<p>
But  hit  a  tree  center  dead<br>
And now she's in Heaven  a-singing.<br>

It seems there's this lady named Tripp,<br>
Who has a face that could sink a ship,<br>
She got Monica's ear,<br>
And voiced her worst fear,<br>
That for HER, Bill would <em>never</em> unzip!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:skink@mindspring.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 11/19/98</h3>
I know I haven’t written much in awhile,<br>
And, my limericks can be totally vile,<br>
But is it so soon forgotten,<br>
Not all my limericks are rotten?<br>
Some of my shit’s made you smile...


<hr>
<h3>Tyler Jefries writes 11/19/98</h3>
There once was a girl named Lynn<br>
Who invited me to wonderful sin<br>
"Stick your cock in my ass"<br>

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Jimbobhopi@aol.com>Jim Schaefer</a> writes 11/18/98</h3>
An intern, very chubby and cute<br>
Blows seductively on the skin flute<br>
We find, somewhat later,<br>
Our Prez is a satyr<br>
In a White House of much ill repute.

<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:chunter@library.uwa.edu.au>Colleen Hunter</a> shares a classic 11/16/98</h3>
There once was a Lady from Nantucket<br>
She went to France in a Bucket<br>
When she got there they asked for her fare<br>
So she hoisted her skirts and said<br>
"I've got a ticket here somewhere."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Cool page.  Apologies for this one if you have already heard it.
- 
Colleen"</i>
<hr>

<h3>Philip writes 11/16/98</h3>
One night, down in Mexico, Tia<br>

And reported, <i>mañana,</i><br>
He was gentle, but had gonnorrhea!
<hr>
<h3>John Chastaine writes 11/16/98</h3>
There once was a shepherd from Wheeling,<br>
Whose sheep gave him a special feeling.<br>
To elevate this love,<br>
To the heavens above,<br>
He put mirrors on the bedroom ceiling.
<p>
A pervert by the name of McNutt,<br>
Thought he found the world's nastiest slut.<br>
She was wall to wall zits, <br>
Had two scabs for tits,<br>
And three tapeworms hanging out of her butt.

An artist with motives demonic<br>
Performs his Concerto Clintonic<br>
But the orchestra hates<br>
When he ejaculates<br>
All over the New Philharmonic.

<i>The poet comments, "If you prefer, add the letter "a" to the end of lines 1,2,and 5."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:aplich@mweb.co.za>Taurean</a> writes 11/12/98</h3>
It seems a great pity<br>
Camels were invented by Committee<br>
Because they're all humpity<br>
They go bumpity, bumpity<br>
And their smell is decidedly shitty.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I have several more limericks in my barnyard.  Will air another shortly.

I woulld appreciate any comments.  Email aplich@mweb.co.za  [Cape Town}"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Martis de Sade writes 11/12/98</h3>
Alone in bed,<br>
terminally well read,<br>
moistened minds wander through dead<br>
romances cherished in vintage urns<br>
of yearnings lost to youthful spurns.
<p>
<i>Toast Point's not sure what the hell this is, but it ain't no limerick.</i>
<hr>

A young girl once said on a Monday,<br>
"I'd like to have, one day, a fun day:<br>
With my ass in the air,<br>
And ten cocks crammed in there,<br>
To be force-fed that hot shit-cum sundae."

<hr>
<h3>Hawk shares a classic 11/04/98</h3>
There once was a hooker named Alice<br>
Who charged by the length of the phallus<br>
Sometimes in a pinch,<br>
She cheated an inch<br>
And lived like a queen in a palace
<hr>
<h3>Aurora writes 11/03/98</h3>
Wee Willy Winkle once had to tinkle<br>
Once on a dark starry night<br>
The outhouse he sought<br>
He soon had forgot<br>
To get out of bed, what a sight!
<hr>
<h3>Wozzle writes 11/02/98</h3>
Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
It can leave a gross stain on your sheet,<br>
Or on your shorts, or the stairs,<br>
And hang off your ass hairs,<br>
Not to mention the bad pain in your seat.
<p>
An anonymous poet online<br>
Is most likely to be unrefined.<br>
If he goes to Toast Point,<br>
For Limericks, out of joint.<br>
Fuck you, Eat shit and Suck mine!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mcdcase@aol.com>Carol Case</a> writes 11/01/98</h3>
If Ken Starr weren't such a butt-insky<br>
We would never have heard of Lewinsky<br>
And we'd never have thought<br>
That adultery ought<br>
To depend on where it's put-insky.


<hr>
<h3>Daniel R. writes 11/01/98</h3>
Coleen was a big brat.<br>
She carried a big black bat.<br>
She was a real fool,<br>
Who never went to school,<br>
Because of her father, Bobcat.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I started to write poetry because of my brother. So I think you should give him some of the
credit."</i>
