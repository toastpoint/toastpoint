There once was a maid from Morocco<br>
Who dated a sex freak named Paco<br>
He said, "wait here please,<br>
I need lettuce and cheese,<br>
Cause your snatch looks just like a taco!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "HUNGRY?"</i>
<p>
<h3><a href=mailto:rodneyd@minot.com>Mijnheer</a> shares a classic 04/29/99</h3>
King Louis gave a lesson in class;<br>
One time while sexing a lass,<br>
When she used the word "damn",<br>
He rebuked her, "please ma'am",<br>
"Keep a more civil tongue in my ass".

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Got a lot of classics, and putting a limerick page on my site"</i>
<p>
The modern cinematic emporium<br>
Is by no means the merest sexorium<br>
But a highly effectual<br>
Heterosexual<br>
Mutual masturbatorium!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My favorite"</i>

My stretchy old sweat pants expando.<br>
They’d even fit old Marlon Brando.<br>
Thank God for the room,<br>
‘Cause somethin’s in bloom,<br>
And I’m goin’ fuckin’ commando!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I hear the term was first "aired" on the show "Friends". Any earlier derivation?"</i>

There once was a priest from Berlin<br>
Whose tool was the size of a pin<br>
Said the Nun with a laugh<br>
As she fondled his staff<br>
This won't be much of a sin!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is one form of a classic limerick that I heard in college."</i>
<p>
One fine day in June<br>
Bill Clinton took Gore to his room<br>
They argued all night<br>
Over who had the right<br>
To do what ,and with which, and to whom!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I'ts been so long I can't remember if it was one of my original ones or not"</i>
<p>
<i>It's a variation of a classic "A faggot who lived in Khartoum/took a lesbian up to his room."

<h3>Sara's friend shares a classic 04/28/99</h3>
Here's to the shrewd nude from Bermuda<br>
Who wanted to be wooed, so I wooed her.<br>
She said, "It is rude<br>
To be wooed in the nude"<br>
So I got ruder, nuder and screwed her.

There was an old sailor named Gum<br>
Who kept his old Cap in a drum -<br>
It cured him real good,<br>
Except for his wood,<br>
Which periscoped out of the rum.
<p>
But Gum had respect for the dead,<br>
And nightly, when all were in bed,<br>
He’d snort him some snot<br>
And rinse off the rot<br>
By giving old Cappy some head.

<hr>
<h3>Sara's friend shares a classic 04/27/99</h3>
A ghoulish old man from Kent<br>
Encrusted his wife in cement.<br>
He said with a leer,<br>
"You'll notice my dear,<br>
I've followed your natural bent."

A beautiful blond from Sun Valley<br>
Did a dance at the fireman's rally.<br>
When she stripped to the buff<br>
It was obvious enough<br>
That the hair on her head didn't tally.

My baby’s like me, poor and reckless.<br>
The love-gifts I give are all feckless.<br>
I can’t afford rings<br>
And diamonds and things,<br>
Just sometimes a lovely pearl necklace.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The gift that keeps on living...
Hope I made proper use of the term, Sage."</i>
<p>
<i>Yep, that's it.  Next task, "going commando".  (Toast Point learned a lot of new 
sexual terms lately.)</i>
<hr>
<h3>Sara Pippalinna writes 04/23/99</h3>
That Doogie pens many verses<br>
Of cock, cunts, cum and curses.<br>
He's more O.C.D.,<br>
Than you or than me,<br>
Much more, I'll need nurses or hearses.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Couldn't resist it."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Doogie writes a whole bunch 04/22/99</h3>
One day while out for a walk<br>
I came across a human outline in chalk<br>
It seems he was nude<br>
For his dick did protrude<br>
And extended an entire city block!
<p>
Through the fence he could see in the backyard<br>
What he saw made his dick grow real hard<br>
Three girls slowly stripping<br>
To go skinny-dipping<br>
The fence-- electric--the tip of his dick was charred!
<p>
There once was a man from Tangier<br>
Who made everyone tremble with fear<br>
It seems in bad weather<br>
Wearing shorts made of leather<br>
Lightning would shoot out of his rear!

<p>
There once was a girl named Louise<br>
Who was an incredbile cock tease<br>
She'd walk around bare<br>
So all guys could stare<br>
But did absolutely nothing to please!

<p>There once was a girl named Goldie<br>
Who wasn't too young or too oldie<br>
But no one would fuck her<br>
Finger or suck her<br>
Cause her pussy was green and all moldie!
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There once was a lady, Ms. Rich<br>
Who suffered always the same itch - <br>
To give it a scratch<br>
She'd eat teenage snatch<br>
That dirty, cunt-licking bitch!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The next few limericks are of the Walt Disney version."</i>

<p>There once was a rodent named Mickey<br>
Who wanted Minnie to suck on his dickey<br>
For 2 hours she protested<br>
The his gland she digested<br>
And what resulted left both of them stickey!

<p>So sad was poor Donald Duck<br>
Because he was down on his luck<br>
His girlfriend Daisy<br>
Drove him real crazy<br>
As she continuously denied him a fuck!

<p>After sleeping with Sir Galahad<br>
She decided he wasn't half bad<br>
But fret she did not<br>
Because Sir Lancelot<br>
Had the other half and much more to add!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I seem to have strayed, I'll be going back now!"</i>
<p>"My dear friend," exclaimed the Mad Hatter<br>
"Whatever is the matter?"<br>
The Doormouse said, "Well, see"<br>
"I've contracted H.I.V."<br>
Boy, you should have seen how fast they did scatter!

<p>Said Minnie to her hubby Mickey<br>
"I have a hot spot I'd like you to lickey."<br>
Before her legs spread<br>
Twixt her knees was his head<br>
Making her all slimy and stickey!"

<p>Said Pluto to his master Mickey<br>
"Here's what you should do with your dickey."<br>
"Shove it up my anus"<br>
"No one can restrain us"<br>
"C'mon teach your dog a new trickey!"

<p>
<h4>Snow White's Gang Bang</h4>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Said the Dwarfs to their friend Snow White<br>
"We want to gang bang you tonight!"<br>
(Said she) "Well, let's see,"<br>
"Seven of you, one of me"<br>
"I guess it would be alright!"

<p>Happy was the first to begin<br>
He stuck his dick in with a grin<br>
He stroked in and out<br>
Finally did spout<br>
And shot his load all over her chin!

<p>The next dwarf in line was Doc<br>
She then gently straddled his cock<br>
Up and down she did bounce<br>
Then swallowed every ounce<br>
Of his hot, molten, gelatinous schlock!
<p>The third dwarf to bang her was sneezy<br>
Needless to say the conditions were breezy<br>
In his own funny way<br>
He was a good lay<br>
But, when finished, he was tired and wheezy.
<p>
The fourth dwarf to mount her was Grumpy<br>
Who was always in the mood for a good humpy<br>
He did her with style<br>
On her face put a smile<br>
And covered her with jism that was lumpy.

<p>
The next one to fuck her was Bashful<br>
Who claims he was brought up in Nashville<br>
When she saw his bit<br>
She damn near did shit<br>
And knew she was in for a gashful!
<p>
The sixth dwarf to pork her was Sleepy<br>
But first he had to go peepy<br>
Then performed a great stunt<br>
Licked her ass, fucked her cunt<br>
The whole thing was really quite creepy!

<p>
Dopey was the last dwarf to do her<br>
But he had no clue how to screw her<br>
He got coaching from Doc<br>
In control of his cock<br>
But he damn near stuck it right through her!
<p>
Snow White was sore and content<br>
After being fucked by seven small gents<br>
But when she arose<br>
To put on her clothes<br>
She was all alone, they all went!
<p>
Poor Goofy was feeling dejected<br>
For his penis he couldn't get erected<br>
No matter what he tried<br>
It was as if it had died<br>
I guess it just felt too rejected.

<p>Said Gepetto to his puppet Pinocchio<br>
"How would you like to fly to Tokyo?<br>
It's all up to you<br>
All you've to do<br>
Is give my big dick a strokio!"

<p>
<i>Toast Point suspects that Doogie's the one who put 
<a href=http://snopes.simplenet.com/disney/films/mermaid.htm>the penis on the Little Mermaid video box</a></i>.
<p>
Said Fred about his girlfriend's beaver<br>
"The only way was to deceive her,"<br>
"But she caught on real quick,"<br>
"Grabbed hold of his dick,"<br>
"And chopped it off with a meat cleaver!"

<p>Said Scully to her boss Skinner<br>
"How would you like to join me for dinner?"<br>
So they went out and ate<br>
Then right around eight<br>
At his place she made him a sinner!

<p>
<i>Toast Point gently suggests to the poet that he concentrate on quality, not quantity.</i>

<h3>Downtown James Kain writes 04/22/99</h3>
It's time that I tell you the truth<br>
My girlfriend's an ol' snaggle tooth<br>
She moans and she whines<br>
When I come in from behind<br>
And jam it right in her caboose!

<hr>
<h3>Elisa@Margeries writes 04/21/99</h3>
Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr<br>
All had a drink at the bar<br>
After Lewinsky had six<br>
She thought Ken's dick was a stick<br>
Then pulled it off 'the tree' and threw it pretty far

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I thought your man was Bill?....."</i>

<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
If your asshole is longing for cock<br>
I've nine inches as hard as a rock<br>
It's also quite thick<br>
This marvelous prick<br>
And ready to fuck round the clock!

<p>

If cock sucking is what you like best<br>
You have come to the end of your quest<br>
You can wiggle and squirm<br>
And swallow my sperm<br>
As I fuck down your throat with great zest.
<p>

If you'd rather jack me off with your hand<br>
Grab hold and strike up the band<br>
Ten feet it will spurt<br>
In squirt after squirt<br>
And my feeling will be really grand.

<p>
If your lady thinks two's better than one<br>
Lets shed clothes and get on with the fun<br>
I'll fuck her quite proper<br>
Whuke I suck on your whopper<br>
We'll come many times ere we're done.
<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:aitch@norfolk.infi.net>H</a> writes 04/21/99</h3>
There was a young fellow named Dennis<br>
Who’d felch ‘em like nobody’s binness.<br>
And when he was drunk<br>
He’d gargle the spunk<br>
And make his head froth like a Guinness.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Dear Sage, Everytime I use the term "felch" I find myself grateful for your
generous edification."</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage comments that edification of sexual terms is his purpose in life. Next we'll 
discuss the pearl necklace.</i>

<h3>Sara Pippalinna writes 04/21/99</h3>
There once was a cheating old louse<br>
Who bethought his wife a meek mouse.<br>
But his dick did wilt<br>
From age and from guilt;<br>
And she kicked him right out of the house.

Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
You mount the throne and take a seat,<br>
You give a big push<br>

We children would often times snicker<br>
When our folks began to bicker.<br>
Soon Mom she would head<br>
Upstairs to her bed<br>
And Dad would follow to dicker!

Had fervent desires to be mated<br>
No eggs to be found <br>
In a bowl clear and round.<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:pjherz@siu.edu>George the Meanie</a> writes 04/19/99</h3>
While married to Hillary, Billy<br>
Had escapades that you'd call silly.<br>
In bed he would thrash<br>
With base trailer trash,<br>
Or some other sexy young filly!

<h3>Passiflora writes 04/17/99</h3>
A guy with an urge to do merge,<br>
He met a hot gal named Converge;<br>
He leapt with a twirl,<br>
She spun with a swirl--<br>
They flew through the air all-a-surge.

<p>
Max Clime was a lover so slick,<br>
He'd Mobius curve his whip dick;<br>
His girl friend would cry,<br>
Oh my, oh, oh, my--<br>
You've set me aflame double quick.

<h3>Doogie writes a whole bunch 04/17/99</h3>
An eagle whose wings had been clipped<br>
Also had its genitals snipped<br>
It can no longer take flight<br>
Or make eaglets at night<br>
It seems in the bud he's been nipped.

<p>
Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
Nor is it very discreet<br>
No matter what you try<br>
You kiss your ass good bye<br>
As well as your balls, dick and feet!

<p>An anonymous poet online<br>
Has every right to opine<br>
But if he can't take a joke<br>
His dick he can stroke<br>
The obnoxious, penis-pumping swine!

<p>
Twenty thousand leagues under the sea<br>
Seems pretty deep if you ask me<br>
But my girlfriend's peeper<br>
Is 12 leagues deeper<br>
And in it, you can scuba for free!

Said Delilah to Samson, "Your hair<br>
Has grown pretty bushy down there<br>
It's really quite thick<br>
I can't see your dick<br>
Are you sure that it's even there?

<p>A privileged client's attorney<br>
Was wheeled by on a hospital gurney<br>
Cause he propositioned sex<br>
From the hot wife of Lex<br>
And got hit in the groin with her knee!

<p>A goldfish whom circling frustrated<br>
Couldn't believe how long he had waited<br>
For a female to swim by<br>
And give him the eye<br>
So he gave up and thus masturbated.

<p>Said a dentist, "Ma'am, please open wider!<br>
Nurse, I can't get my penis inside her<br>
Her pussy's too tight<br>
Stretch it open a might<br>
Then I'll be able to ride her!"

<p>
The whole trouble with airlines is planes<br>
Cause the seats are all covered with cum stains<br>
The bathrooms are too small<br>
To eat, suck, and ball<br>
And that's why everyone complains!

<p>Mathematics: of sciences, queen<br>
That, my friend, remains to be seen<br>
I think anatomy is better<br>
You can get a girl wetter<br>
By licking her thighs and what's in between!

<p>While swimming across the Zambezi<br>
I noticed a girl who was really sleazy<br>
She said,"Master the river"<br>
"I'll give you my quiver"<br>
Just the thought of it made me real queasy.

<p>A curious mammal's the beaver<br>
If my wife didn't have one, I'd leave her<br>
Cause there is no doubt<br>
That I won't live without<br>
If she leaves, I'll chop it off with a cleaver!

<p>Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr<br>
Were talking one day in a bar<br>
"Lewinsky, you sucked<br>
Now Ol' Willie is fucked<br>
The question now is just how far?"

There once was a whore from Dublin<br>
Who discovered somethin' very trublin<br>
She'd caught a disease<br>
Which looked like string cheese<br>
And out of her cunt it was bubblin!

Said one girl to another in class<br>
"Have you ever been fucked up the ass?<br>
Cause I did it last night<br>
And it seemed all right<br>
But it gives you a bad case of gas!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I told you there was more to come. Did I use enough of the given opening lines, huh?"</i>
<p>A young girl, all her money was spent up<br>
And her frustrations she did keep well pent up<br>
Said her landlord, "Here's a shock<br>
If you don't suck my cock<br>
I'm gonna hafta raise your rent up!"

<p>
There once was a girl named Clarisse<br>
Of whom every guy wanted a piece<br>
Big tits and nice ass<br>
Oozed nothing but class<br>
Unlike her nymphomaniac niece!

A philosopher, finding a stone<br>
Was as giddy as a dog with a bone<br>
He traded it for<br>
Three nights with a whore<br>
To this very day he's still lying prone.

<p>If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
I think he would be quite blown away<br>
By all the publication<br>
About fornication<br>
Be it hetero, bi-sexual, ot gay.

<p>A nubile young Finn who went skiing - <br>
His penis, he was frequently freeing...<br>
When girls would ski by<br>
He'd unzip his fly<br>
And show them a sight worth seeing!

<i>The poet comments, "Clinton's thoughts: Hey, this bombing shit is really cool. Depends on your

And show off her quim,<br>
Wearing only her shoes and a hat.

There once was a lady <br>
Afraid to fuck men,<br>
So, she screwed her self with a fountain pen.<br>
The fountain pen broke,and the ink went wild<br>
And she gave birth to a colored child.

There once was a guy from Pipe Creek<br>
Of whom it was said, "What a geek".<br>
For pussy he pined,<br>
But no one so kind<br>
Would give the relief he did seek.

<p>
At last he met Grandma Kate,<br>
Who consented to go on a date.<br>
He was much younger,<br>
But oh, such hunger.<br>
Granny smiled and could hardly wait.
<p>
He rocked her and he rolled her,<br>
Even though she was much older.<br>
He kept his eyes closed<br>
While pussy he nosed,<br>
Dreaming of girls young and colder.

<p>
<i>Sara, we have no idea why you got caught in that loop.  If this keeps happening, let us know.</i>

A sister who lived in a cloister<br>
Went in search of the pearl in the oyster:<br>
This innocent girl <br>
Soon located the pearl<br>
And the oyster got hotter and moister!

His old cock was wrinkled and soft<br>
'Twas quite hard to get it aloft.<br>
Then he honeymooned at Niagra<br>
And took some Viagra<br>
And shot wads every time that he coughed!

Though randiness just wouldn't quit,<br>
She gave up on sex in a snit.<br>
For the dick she did seek<br>
Might hang on a geek<br>
And not in the crotch of a wit.

A neighborhood boy, young Mickey,<br>
Had boogers incredibly sticky.<br>

Although he was good with his mouth,<br>
I had to break up with Ralph.<br>
He was nice to my lips,<br>
But not the ones past the hips.<br>
If only he had ventured more South!

An unfortunate lady named Dot<br>
Had an overabundance of snot.<br>
But it wasn't her nose<br>
That dripped onto her clothes.<br>
From the smell I'd say it was her twat!

<p>There once was a man we called Decker<br>
Whose nose was as long as his pecker.<br>
His girlfriend named Babs<br>
Didn't mind 'bout his crabs,<br>
'Cause his schnoz surely wouldn't infect her!

<p>I was so enamoured with Randall<br>
That I let him insert a big candle.<br>
But then came the match<br>
Which burned up my snatch.<br>
I guess now I'm too hot to handle!

<H2>Rhubarb <a name="pent">shares</a> classics from <A
HREF="http://pw1.netcom.com/~pentatet/reply.html">Pentatette</A> and elsewhere</H2>
<h4>by Lewis Pavlo</h4>
There once was a girl named Carrie,<br>
Who left for camp with her cherry. <br>
But she met a beagle, <br>
Who took her spreadeagle; <br>
Her son is real short and quite hairy.
<p>
<h4>from KJ</h4>
Making love on the beach on your back<br>
May be fun but, alas and alack,<br>
It sure ruins the mood<br>
When after you've screwed,<br>
You have all of that sand in your crack!
<p>

<h4>from Frank Fazed</h4>
For smart girls, a matter of pride<br>
Is to keep sand from scratching their hide.<br>
When climax they reach,<br>
On a moonlit beach,<br>
They do it while riding astride.
<p>

<h4>from Barry Becker</h4>
While thrashing around in the hay,<br>
The lass to the laddie did say,<br>
"I've got straw in each orifice,<br>
And your dick is amorphous.<br>
Now that's what I call a bad lay."
<p>

<h4>from Mr Malo</h4>
All of us big kahunas<br>
Like removing a girl's pantaloonas,<br>
Then spreading her lips<br>
With fingertips,<br>
To dive for a swim with the tunas.
<p>
<h4>from KJ</h4>
Here's a pick-up line better than honey;<br>
It's not clever, nor witty, nor funny. <br>
But it works every time, <br>
'Stead of 'Your place or mine?'<br>
Try 'Want to help me spend some money?'
<p>

<h4>from Les Stewart</h4>
At the whorehouse, I saved me some dough.<br>
Twenty-five of fifty, 'tis so.<br>
But it is not pleasin'<br>
To tell you the reason.<br>
You pay by the inch, don't you know.
<p>
<h4>from Dreamarill </h4>
Sex on the beach can be fun,<br>
Making love in the noonday sun.<br>
But if you eschew<br>
SPF 22,<br>
You'll  wind up with a sunburnt bun.
<p>

<h4>from Arden</h4>
I tried for some sex in the sand;<br>
It was more than I found I could stand.<br>
While she was hot,<br>
All that I got,<br>
Was crabs, the size of my hand.
<p>

<h4>from Mr Malo</h4>
When women get older they say,<br>
They are much more easy to lay.<br>
They put up less fight<br>
In the dead of the night,<br>
'Cause most times, they sleep the whole way.
<p>

<h4>from Kaylin</h4>
There was a young man named Sid,<br>
Who said as they lay there naked,<br>
"I love you so madly;<br>
Wanted to make love so badly..."<br>
She replied, "And that's just what your did!"
<p>

<h4>from Ivor Robert Jones</h4>
There was an old man from Dundalk,<br>
Whose willy had turned into chalk.<br>
The women said, "Fine,<br>
If we draw a straight line,<br>
You can sign your name as you walk."
<p>

<h4>from Lynn</h4>
The night before Christmas is here;<br>
Soon sleigh bells and reindeer we'll hear.<br>
Each good girl and boy<br>
Will get a new toy,<br>
And the bad ones will get drunk on beer!
<p>

<h4>from John Miller</h4>
We partied till tired to the bone,<br>
All too quickly the hours they had flown.<br>
The thing finally broke up<br>
But half of us woke up<br>
In beds not our own, nor alone!
<p>

<h4>from DryGulch</h4>
In front of the fire sat Rose<br>
Attempting to thaw out her toes.<br>
It was thirty below,<br>
When she rolled in the snow,<br>
And her pussy was fucking near froze.
<p>

<h4>from Daniel Ford</h4>
We send you our seasonal greeting,<br>
As the year seems to be so fleeting.<br>
May your feel the love<br>
That's shared from above,<br>
As well as the rain, snow, and sleeting.
<p>

<h4>from John Miller</h4>
Often cited, I have to agree;<br>
This is fruit from the limerick tree.<br>
But what makes me groan<br>
Is that "author unknown"<br>
Is quoted more often than me.
<p>

<h4>from Les Stewart</h4>
Old Roy has now been rebuffed<br>
And his pride? It has now been scuffed.<br>
"Horse," he did say,<br>
"Want some more hay?"<br>
Said Trigger, "No thanks, I am stuffed!"
<p>

<h4>from the Jim Weaver Collection</h4>
On Maltilda's white bosom there leaned<br>
The cheek of a low-minded fiend.<br>
But she yanked up his head,<br>
And sarcastically said,<br>
"My Boy! Won't you ever be weaned!"
<p>
The gnu's a bit shaggy, it's true,<br>
But well known and quite popular, too.<br>
In France he's adored,<br>
But Italians are bored,<br>
And frequently ask, "What's a gnu?"
<p>
To a whore, a young fellow named Clyde<br>
Said, "I'll pay if new sex you provide."<br>
Her glass eye she took out,<br>
And she said, "Without doubt,<br>
Here's a fuck that you never have tried."
<p>
He gave her the dough from his pocket,<br>
And his prick she slipped in the socket.<br>
Before he could blink,<br>
She gave him a wink,<br>
And his pecker went off like a rocket
<p>
"My God!" shouted Clyde as he blew,<br>
"I must have another such screw!<br>
For more cash I must go."<br>
And the harlot said, "So<br>
I'll be keeping an eye out for you."
<p>
John Hickey received some nice flowers<br>
From Clinton, the man of great powers.<br>
This would be eclectic;<br>
He's shown he's dyslexic.<br>
He meant to give hickeys to Flowers.
<p>
A dour old dwarf named Fritz,<br>
Was burned right where he sits.<br>
That happens, they say,<br>
When you get in the way<br>
Of a dragon, just as he spits.
<p>
There once was a lecherous plumber<br>
Who boasted to every newcomer,<br>
How he went about smelling<br>
(I blush with the telling)<br>
Girl's bicycle seats in the summer.
<p>
There once was a fellow named Greg<br>
With designs on a young lass named Meg.<br>
"Let's do it doggy style,"<br>
He said with a smile,<br>
So she made him sit up and beg.
<p>
There once was a man from Rangoon,<br>
Who tried to fart his way to the moon.<br>
Seems he flopped as a rocket,<br>
Shit in his pocket,<br>
And died in a rectal typhoon.
<p>

As he lay in the tub broken-hearted,<br>
The queer tried to hold back, but farted. <br>
It made him so sick<br>
To see the Vaseline slick<br>
Of his long lost lover departed.
<p>
A promiscuous hiker, Louise,<br>
Scratched an itch she just couldn't appease.<br>
Her torrid affair<br>
With a grizzly bear<br>
Left her muffin infested with fleas.
<p>
To add to the two -- Death and Taxes --<br>
With AIDS everywhere -- Prophylaxis.<br>
As sure as is breathing,<br>
No sex without sheathing;<br>
Death/Taxes and now no bare access.
<p>
Analysis proves it just fine;<br>
The French way of love is divine.<br>
To add to the fun,<br>
Try seventy one;<br>
Sixty nine plus two more and some wine.
<p>
They say it's according to Hoyle.<br>
Before you should dipstick her oil,<br>
It's OK to tease,<br>
But remember disease,<br>
And be sure to wrap it in foil!
<p>
Well-groomed Wanda betook her the trouble<br>
Of mantaining hairstyles double.<br>
Above, she'd insist<br>
On a stylish French Twist,<br>
But she coiffed up her snatch with a bubble.
<p>
A gallant young cocksman named Nick,<br>
Is known for his prehensile prick.<br>
He takes the thing out,<br>
And waves it about,<br>
Without using his hands...What a trick!
<p>
A dog, busy licking his crotch,<br>
Thought to himself, "What a botch!<br>
I keep showing my owner<br>
How to handle my boner,<br>
But he'd just rather sit there and watch!"
<p>
Jesse Helms is a nasty old prune.<br>
His face surely isn't rough-hewn.<br>
In fact, the fascist fucker's<br>
Face tend to pucker<br>
Like he's been sippin' cold piss off a spoon.
<p>
Emboldened by your corporate ambitions,<br>
On all fours, you confirm my suspicions.<br>
With your buttocks a-gleaming,<br>
You give a new meaning<br>
To the phrase "entry level positions."
<p>
My girl friend gives me a lay<br>
And then she is done for the day.<br>
I feel like a dunce<br>
Only doing it once,<br>
But practice makes perfect, they say.
<p>
Her teeth are like corn too long cooking;<br>
Big nose fit for overnight booking;<br>
She may look like Rover,<br>
But when she bends over,<br>
She really ain't all that bad looking.
<p>
"Of apples," God warned them, "be wary.<br>
They can make situations quite hairy."<br>
But I doubt that's the fruit<br>
That gave them the boot;<br>
More likely 'twas only a cherry.
<p>
When we left the pool, she was brazen.<br>
And when I undressed, she was gazin'.<br>
That water was cold,<br>
And Lo and Behold!<br>
My grape had turned into a raisin.
<p>
There was this young boy named Fritz,<br>
Who has orgasms each time he shits.<br>
"This not knowing<br>
If I'm coming or going,<br>
Is driving me out of my wits.
<p>
Emily was a good friend;<br>
I enjoyed her right to the end.<br>
I really do miss her,<br>
But I'd never kiss her,<br>
Not after where her lips had been.
<p>
When I think about what Descartes said,<br>
You exist where you are in your head --<br>
It is perfectly clear,<br>
That I'm not really here;<br>
I am inside your panties instead!
<p>
A lady friend wanted a screw.<br>
Flat-headed, I just wouldn't do.<br>
She settled instead<br>
For Phil Phillip's head.<br>
He tightened her up a bit too.
<p>
That thing you see smiling at you,<br>
And that you're attempting to woo,<br>
Is the end of a horse.<br>
You could do it, of course,<br>
But it's shameless self-love if you do.
<p>
I'm sorry to hear you're so ill.<br>
I know this is painful, but still,<br>
You won't be down long.<br>
In case I am wrong,<br>
Please tell me if I'm in your will?
<p>
She said to herself, "What's his age?<br>
The guy is a wit and a sage."<br>
The girls when they chatter,<br>
Say, "What does it matter?<br>
That stud should be kept in a cage."
<p>

When Jonah went into the whale,<br>
He was spit out again, whole and hale. <br>
But that is for looks<br>
And the sale of good books. <br>
I bet he was shat out the tail!
