<h3>Tony the Tiger takes the "Rah Rah" award with</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Do cheerleaders wear cotton panties?<br>
Pray, tell me your view of their scanties.<br>
If you only see hair,<br>
There's just air under there.<br>
Which surely would many a man please!
<hr>
<h3>Matt King grabs the "Resourceful" category with</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
There once was a man named Nate<br>
Who couldn't manage a hot date<br>
So he wrangled the bucks<br>
For inflatable fucks<br>
And purchased a girl in a crate!
<hr>
<h3>A poet might be Martin Wellborn garners the Sophie Tucker trophy</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
While humping his wife in the sack<br>
He remarked, "Dear, it's tits that you lack<br>
And your crotch is too snug."<br>
She replied with a shrug,<br>
"You bastard, just get off my back."
<hr>
<h3>The Fuzbear (aka Chip) grabs the "Golden Arches" award with</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
A musician who worked for "Les Miz"<br>
Tried to exit the pit for a whiz,<br>
But was stopped ere he could;<br>
Wo, he pissed where he stood<br>
In a cup, as he crooned, "That's show biz!"<br>
<b>Toast Point notes</b> - <i>the ring of truth to this limerick gives it 
its golden luster!</i>
<hr>
<h3>JohnD sweeps the "Political" categories</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
A clearly bemused Lawyer Hill<br>
Eyed pubic hair topping her swill.<br>
"I make you this promise:<br>
If it's one from C. Thomas,<br>
That homeboy be needin' some skill."<br>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
If you notice some sag in your tush<br>
And you've given Weight Watchers the brush,<br>
No need to feel sad<br>
Or judge yourself bad -<br>
You're surely less bloated than Rush.
<p>
His views are the match of his girth;<br>
They're outsize and would attract mirth<br>
But the ditto-head scrum<br>
Is so glum or so dumb<br>
That they egg on this not-upon-earth.
<p>
Oh, dearie, pontificate.<br>
Politicos do it in state<br>
Since they know they'll get warts<br>
Without their cohorts -<br>
But, Rush, go ahead, masturbate.

<h2>Dishonorable Mention</h2>
<h3>Rhubarb submits a classic 9/29</h3>
There was a young man named Victor<br>
Who buggered a boa constrictor.<Br>
The result of this rape<br>
Was a mile of Scotch Tape<br>
And three reels from an old Tarzan picture.                               
<hr>
<h3>Tonya R. Ford from Barrhead submits a classic non-limerick 9/29</h3>
Old Miss hubbard went to her cupboard<br>
To get poor Rover a bone, <br>
and when she bent over Rover took over<br>
And gave her a bone of her own.
<hr>
<h3>J0yce writes 9/24</h3>
I think that my new dog is Dachshund<br>
I got him for free at the dog pound<br>
When he rides on my knee<br>
With his thing used to pee<br>
I wonder, does he think I'm a horehound???
<hr>
<h3>Neal Hunt shares a classic 9/24</h3>
There was a young lady from Thrace<br>
Whose girdle got harder to lace<br>
'Til her mother said, "Nellie,<br>
There's more in your belly<br>
Then ever got there through your face."
<hr>
<h3>Tom Mix shares a classic 9/20</h3>
There was a young sailor named Bates<br>
Who danced the fandango on skates<br>
But a fall on his cutlass<br>
has rendered him nutless<br>
And practically useless on dates<br>
<b>Note</b> - <i>a <a href=nautaug.html#skates>variation</a> on this classic 
was submitted in August.</i>
<hr>
<h3>Matt King writes...</h3>
There once were multiple verns<br>
Who liked to frolic in ferns.<br>
They took off their pants <br>
And did their little dance;<br>
One comes when the other one yearns.
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 9/20</h3>
There was a young man of Strensall<br>
Whose prick was shaped like a pencil.<br>
Anemic, 'tis true,<br>
But an interesting screw,<br>
Inasmuch as the tip is prehensile.
<hr>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
<h3>This anonymously-submitted non-limerick gets a star anyway:</h3>
The sexual urge of the camel<br>
 is greater than anyone thinks,<br>
For this preposterous mammal<br>
 attempted to roger the Sphinx!<br>
Now the Sphinx's exterior orifice <br>
 was clogged with the sands of the Nile,<br>
Which accounts for the hump on the camel <br>
 and the Sphinx's inscrutable smile!
<hr>
<h3>Mr. Wine writes 9/18</h3>
An endowed birthday boy named Ed<br>
Just couldn't wait to be fed.<br>
Such a blow did he make<br>
To extinguish his cake<br>
That his pecker exploded instead!
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 9/18</h3>
There was a professor Collossal<br>
Who found the most interesting fossil.<br>

And the wart on its end<br>
T'was the peter of Paul the apostle.
<hr>
<h3>Mike Hanafin shares a classic 9/18</h3>
There was a young prince from Khartoum<br>
Who lured a poor girl to her doom <br>
He not only fucked her<br>
But buggered and sucked her<br>
And left her to pay for the room!<br>
<hr>
<h3>C.D.C. writes 9/18</h3>
There once was a man named McGruder<br>
Who went to see a nude and he wooed her<br>
The nude thought it rude<br>
To be wooed in the nude,<br>
But McGruder was shrewder and screwed her!
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic too!</h3>

And they found his balls in Brazil!
<hr>
<h3>Mr. Wine shares a classic 9/14/</h3>

His razor he'd hone<br>
On the end of his bone<br>
And lather his face with the charge.
<hr>
<h3>William Ted writes 9/10</h3>
There was a young man from San Dimas<br>
Who had such an enormous penis<br>
All the women would cry<br>
As they went by<br>
Please let us share it between us
<hr>
<h3>caspian@gate.net writes 9/9</h3>
There once was a girl named Dyna <br>
Who had a smelly vagina<br>
It stunk, and it reeked<br>
And when you fucked it, it squeaked<br>
How do ya like the vagina of mine-a?
<hr>
<h3>Mikey writes 9/8</h3>
There once was a teacher at school<br>
Everyone thought she was a fool<br>
Though her name was Ms. Pope <br>
She is hooked on dope<br>
But we still think she's pretty cool!<br>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>This isn't naughty, but it's not squeaky-clean, 
either.  What to do, what to do...</i>
<hr>
<h3>Big Mike in Oz writes 9/7</h3>
Said the prostitute dropping her towel<br>
There's only one rule that I follow,<br>
You can insert your shaft<br>
In holes fore or aft,<br>
But its output I never will swallow.

<hr>
<h3>Mr. Wine shares two classics 9/3</h3>
A mathematician named Paul<br>
Had an octangular ball<br>
The cube of its weight<br>
Plus his pecker times eight<br>
Is his phone number....give him a call.
<p>
There once was a woman named Alice<br>
Who used a dynamite stick for a phallus<br>
They found her vagina <br>
In North Carolina<br>
And her tits in Buckingham Palace.
<hr>
<h3>Claureen Blytche writes 9/2</h3>
A strange man once offered me candy<br>
And I said "Oh, sure, that'd be dandy!"<br>

Was really my hole<br>
But that's OK, I'm always randy!
