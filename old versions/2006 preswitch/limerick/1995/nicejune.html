<h2>Squeaky-Clean Entries for June 1995</h2>
Six entries for June, one up on May...<p>
<h3>The Winner for June, Hands Down</h3>

<h3><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=bottom>
Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/4</h3>
The opera's a terrible bore<br>
That Carmen's no more than a whore.<br>
Snored through Rigoletto<br>
(Forgot the libretto)<br>
And what's that darned racket, the score?
<HR>
<h2>Honorable Mention:</h2>
<h3>Muriel writes 6/27</h3>
There once was a young dancing queen<br>
Young and sweet, only just seventeen<br>
She could dance, she could jive<br>
Had the time of her life<br>
When she did the lambada obscene.
<hr>
<h3>Janet Whaley writes 6/12</h3>
Don Reilly, the world's greatest actor -<br>
His art! His use of Max Factor!<br>
This freshman sensation<br>
Induces elation<br>
Much better than my chiropractor.
<br>

<h3>Millicent Friendly writes 6/12</h3>
One cannot express the elation<br>
Of flying off on on a vacation<br>
And finding the locals<br>
(The nice ones, not yokels)<br>
Engaging oneself in flirtation!
<hr>
<h3>Hungry Hannah writes 6/6</h3>
The thing about men from Wayne State<BR>
(And this incidentally I hate)<BR>
They dress for distress<BR>
And I must confess<BR>
They take mommy on every date!
