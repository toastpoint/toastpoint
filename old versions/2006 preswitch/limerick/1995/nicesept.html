<h3>Beaker takes the "Botany" trophy with</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
An "outdoorsy" chick, fond of hikin'<br>
Soon learned she prefered mountain bikin'.<br>
For, when hiking on rocks<br>
"Yuckies" stuck to her socks.<br>
(Itchy, crisp, crunchy grungies called "lichen".)
<hr>
<h3>mkolbe@goodnet.com takes the "Wild Wild West" category</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
The summers in Phoenix, AZ<br>
Will cause me to search frantically<br>
For that blessed spot<br>
In a hot parking lot<br>
Found under the shade of a tree
<hr>
<h3> Baby Jane Hudson takes the "Perry Ellis" award</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
I'm thinking of giving up Fashion -<br>
Too much skin (and I'm not fond of flashin').<br>
I'll no longer pay<br>
For some tired Gaultier<br>
Just to look like I've gotten a lashin'.

<hr>
<h3>Victoria sweeps the "Nintendo" category</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
The great battle was heavy and hot<br>
I just had to connect with each shot.<br>
But then, full of dread<br>
I found myself dead,<br>
So I put one more coin in the slot...
<hr>
<h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
<h3>TKDFB12480@aol.com (Fran Bigman) writes 9/30</h3>
Computers have minds of their own<br>
For PC'ers, this widely is known.<br>
Windows is such a joke,<br>
Gates' license we'll revoke,<br>
'Cause Macintosh seeds have been sown!
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 9/30</h3>
A horror of pink cotton candy<br>
Adhered to a tadpole named Mandy,<br>
It wouldn't get OFF,<br>
And her legs, they were lost,<br>
And she said; I'm a frog, ain't that dandy!
<hr>
<h3>Joe Dunn writes 9/22</h3>
Empty air that engulfs whispers in the night<br>
Sits the evil in me with much despite<br>
Who would touch me when I was alone?<br>
Who would see me when I was blind?<br>
Killed by a god I had lost my time<br>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>It's not a limerick, but...OK...</i>

<hr>
<h3>George Cook writes 9/20</h3>
A horror of pink cotton candy<br>
Slipped down the throat of young Mandy.<br>
She waved and she spluttered.<br>
Her parents they fluttered,<br>
But her brother he thought it was dandy.
<hr>
<h3>A poet who might be Arthur writes 9/16</h3>
Said the Postmaster General, "Hurray!<br>
I've something important to say,<br>
The letter you send<br>
From here to South Bend<br>
Costs less than a penny a day."
<hr>
<h3>JohnD writes 9/15</h3>
Politicos often shift role<br>
And success goes to those without soul:<br>
As a party moves right,<br>
The knave becomes knight,<br>
Though I wouldn't touch Dole with a pole.

<hr>
<h3>SARA writes 9/14</h3>
There once was a man named Shaq<br>
For b-ball he had a knack<br>
He was really tall<br>
And could palm a ball<br>
And is young and gifted and black

<hr>
<h3>Varnicia writes 9/1</h3>
My muffins are just so delicious<br>
My girlfriends get jealous and vicious<br>
When Evie said that<br>
They made me look fat<br>
I slapped her and broke all her dishes!
