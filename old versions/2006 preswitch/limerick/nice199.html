<h3>Sandy Shalott writes 01/30/99</h3>
If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
His thoughts about love would sway<br>
The porno and pics <br>
And condoms and tricks<br>
Would bring him back for a day.

If the trouble with Parmesan cheese<br>
Is it cakes in the shaker with ease,<br>
There is hardly a doubt<br>
That in shaking it out<br>
You have burned more than earned calories!

For a verse not my own contribution<br>
I adhere to a firm resolution<br>
If something is good<br>
Then forward I would,<br>
But never without attribution.
<p>
Y2K, is there some way to slow it?<br>
And if not, will we really then blow it,<br>
Or perhaps some young heroes<br>
Can conquer the zeroes<br>
And save us this world as we know it.
<p>The Senate's redundant and rigid,<br>
The cost now is almost six digits,<br>
It's all such a bore<br>
Do we have to have more?<br>
Tempus no longer fugits, it fidgits.

An anonymous poet online<br>
Had a habit of sipping cheap wine.<br>
His vice was soon ended,<br>
When a priest he befriended,<br>
While writing an x-rated rhyme!

They say that we hillbillies are dumb;<br>
That we can't even twiddle our thumbs!<br>
But our football sure shines;<br>
Those VOLS are so fine!<br>
So, tell me. . now, where are you from?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "VOLS - undefeated, SEC Champions, and Fiesta Bowl Champs!  GO VOLS!
(We just pretend to be dumb!) "</i>
<p>
If we were all made to be blind,<br>
Our sight, we would suddenly find;<br>
We'd learn to look past<br>
Our looks and our class;<br>
And we'd all be a little more kind!
<p>To live in the US of A<br>
Is a wonderful privilege, today;<br>
We take it for granted<br>
That here, it's enchanted;<br>
So, we gripe and we whine and complain!

What's good timing for male intromission<br>
In nematode sperm competition? ...<br>
Is the early worm's sperm<br>
That which catches the germ &#151<br>
Or will late sperm usurp its position?

An Austrian boa constrictor<br>
Whose victim said "Ich bin ein dichter"<br>
Agreed he'd unwind<br>
To hear limericks opined ...<br>

Impeachment's a G.O.P.  ruse<br>

Were thus stalked, I can't guess<br>
In the fallout, how many we'd lose.

Any smooth vector field on a sphere<br>

That's why when you comb<br>
Out the hair on your dome<br>
You must leave a patch of it clear.

Toast Point's on a roll<br>
But he's out of control<br>
With energy poets can exploit.

A man says his wife's faults are many,<br>

She'll deny and reject<br>
That her husband's correct...<br>
He'd admit his faults, if he had any!

About five, seven, five<br>

Slick Willie should throw in the towel<br>
And Hillary should finally cry "foul!"<br>
Tune in tomorrow<br>
To a tale of sorrow<br>
But in 2000 let's elect Colin Powell!

<p>
How did Slick get into this mess?<br>
We're dying to hear him confess<br>
He'll never undo it<br>
Since Monica blew it<br>
DNA evidence is all over her dress.
<p>
How can politics ever be the same?<br>
Who would play in this kind of game?<br>
Not Hyde nor Burton<br>
Their reputations hurtin'<br>
The media and Starr are to blame.
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
My vocabulary's gotten spacious<br>
I can say suborn and salacious!<br>
It's called "Clintonese"<br>
(A form of legalese)<br>
Since Bill found Monica bodacious!
<p>
"We weren't alone", Slick told Starr<br>
In Clintonese: "the door was ajar"<br>
If he says "is" to you<br>
Only present tense will do<br>
The truth isn't near, it's afar
<p>
Alas, this man from Hope is into pandering<br>
Using the "hot line" for phone sex bantering<br>
And Wild Bill tells lies<br>
Looking into our eyes<br>
When he says he's not into philandering
<p>
One thing those polls have made clear<br>
It isn't the president we need to fear<br>
But our flagging morals<br>
Sin finds no quarrels<br>
With those who won't hold virtue dear
<p>
"We the people" have welshed on shame<br>
We let repenters jump back in the game<br>
SEXUAL OBSESSION<br>
That's our confession<br>
Facing Hell we just laugh at the flame
<p>
America's throne now stands debased<br>
Why hasn't this rogue been disgraced?<br>
As morality crumbles<br>
No one grumbles<br>
To an economy is our forgiveness traced
<p>
Team Clinton can spin at top speed<br>
Giving Starr & Congress a nosebleed<br>
"Proving perjury's tough"<br>
"Bill's suffered enough"<br>
We're not only spun but pureed!
<p>
Beware if you're anti-Arkansan<br>
For Hillary stands by her man<br>
Foiling conspiracys<br>
Saves co-presidencys<br>
"First Lady in 2000" is the plan
<p>
Ms. Health Care's got her "village" thing<br>
We know she makes commodities sing<br>
And Tipper's content<br>
Being vice-president<br>
"Clinton-Gore 2000", am I hallucinating!?!?

An old Texas boy named McCall<br>
Who talked with an old southern drawl, <br>
Said "fanger" for "finger"<br>
And "sanger" for "singer"<br>
And "I lak Jurry Spranger, don't y'all?"

My friend Tara, a slim vegetarian<br>
Always knows what her stomach is carryin'<br>
If you take her advice<br>
And just 'eat lots of rice'<br>
You may end up an octagenarian!

After reading the limericks posted<br>
I felt entitled so boasted<br>
These are so lame!<br>
No wonder no-name!<br>
Only my poetry should be toast-ed!"

A baby alligator was sad<br>
About the lonely life that he had.<br>
Approaching two shoes,<br>
He said, "Please excuse,<br>
But, could you be my Mom and my Dad?"

Off to pay your taxes you tarry,<br>
Ever larger the burden you carry;<br>
Blame the County Assessor,<br>
Who knows greater, not lesser,<br>
And disclaims, "Your millage may vary."
<p>
The season has led to some doubting,<br>
And has driven Coach Mike to shouting,<br>
But on this playoff day,<br>
Let's keep 3Com at bay,<br>
And let the Packers do the routing.

Does Beelzebub wear a disguise?<br>
Does he play with the zippers of guys?<br>
The question's legit<br>
Of this devilish twit,<br>
After all, he's the Lord of the flies!
