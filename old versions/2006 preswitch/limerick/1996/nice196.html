There once was a man named Rick,<br>
Whose legs were as thin as a stick.<br>
He told his dog, Fletch<br>
To go out and "Fetch!"<br>
So, the dog brought Rick back quick!

In back of my seat, young Sylvester<br>
Screamed and kicked while my anger did fester!<br>
My good humor he bested -<br>
But I had him arrested<br>
For being an Adult Molester!

If you only like limericks clean<br>
There's a whole 'nother world you've not seen!<br>
So check out the 
<a href=naut196.html>naughty ones</a><br>
Those raunchy and bawdy ones - <br>
They're some of the best I've ob scene!

Frode...</a> writes 1/25</h3>
Life you must live to the limit<br>
Every day, every hour, every minute<br>
But with greatest respect<br>
Just laugh and reflect<br>
How you thought, you were important, in it.

On Friday, November thirteen,<br>
The clairvoyants of Madingley Green<br>
Were forced to abandon<br>
The meeting they'd planned on,<br>
By circumstances unforeseen....

<h3>Anon writes 1/23</h3>
The cuckoo's a curious bird<br>
It hates to be seen or be heard<br>
As it enters the nest<br>
Of the chick it likes best.<br>
But it makes the cuckold look absurd!

I like a poem with rhyme,<br>
With meaning, and meter, and time.<br>
It just drives me crazy,<br>
When the message is hazy,<br>
And free verse is simply a crime!

<hr>
<h3>Rmac writes 1/20</h3>
Bob finds his dates all inferior<br>
If not in the front, then the derriere.<br>
Mae's too short; June's too tall,<br>
Jill's as flat as a wall,<br>
And Sandy's as wide as a carrier.
<p>
Barbra? Well she's just so hairy, her<br>
Face looks like that of a terrier.<br>
Jane's too big; Kim's too small.<br>
He's rejected them all,<br>
Citing his basic criteria.

Said a comp science lecturer Zhart,<br>
Explaining the programmer's art:<br>
"When the job is complete,<br>
Ctrl-Alt-Delete<br>
Will boot you right back to the start."

Nuclear car engine mods?<br>
I wonder, just what are the odds ...<br>
To stop the emissions,<br>
Just break from tradition,<br>
And fuel 'em with small fission rods.

<h3>Mike Robinson writes 1/19</h3>
There once was a boxer mamed Pat<br>
Who thought he was as tough as a rat<br>
Until he met Sid<br>
Who beat on Pat's head<br>
Now it's Pat who's down on the mat!

<hr>
<h3>Ceejay submits a modified version of a classic 1/18</h3>
There was a young lady of Bude<br>
Who went for a swim in the lake.<br>
A chap in a punt<br>
Grabbed hold of her arm<br>
And said "You can't swim here. It's private".
<p>
<b>The Sage assumes that the unmodified one rhymes, and is naughty...</b>

To Robin and Batman "You're toast!",<br>
Said the Jester, "That's no idle boast!"<br>
But (you guessed it) the caped<br>
Crusaders escaped.<br>
HOW much did you say the film grossed?!

A partner in flesh and in mind.<br>
Why is that so hard to find?<br>
She wants the moon -<br>
He gives up too soon -<br>
Lots of fish in the sea - but what kind?

There was this odd programmer guy<br>
Who came to this page by and by<br>
He entered a rhyme<br>
And blushed red as wine!<br>
Just goes to show how I'm shy...
<p>
In June, I might yet remember<br>
The end of cold dark December<br>
I'll dance in my shorts<br>
And play lots of sports.<br>
But what to do come November?
<p>

In a laundrymat I did flirt<br>
With girls, who were otherwise curt<br>
I smiled, I laughed,<br>
Yet none knew my craft.<br>
Well, at least now I have a clean shirt!

There once was a pig named Mork<br>
Who lived on the streets of New York<br>
He got in a fight<br>
In an alley one night <br>
And then he was sliced up for pork!

And when he got there<br>
He was in for a scare<br>
'Cause there he got stung by a bee!

Gew feathers on his back<br>
And now lives by the pond on the hill!

"I've hidden my gold<br>
within this household!<br>
It's in - uhh!" and went on to his death.<p>
<i>Just a thought...</i>

<h3>Depressed writes 1/12</h3>
I hate everybody today<br>
Those blue sunny skies have turned gray<br>
I can't give any more<br>
I can't live anymore<br>
I've written the end of my play.

Hand me that bottle of booze - <br>
Got the post-holiday blues!<br>
And like it or not<br>
This glum feeling I've got<br>
Will take at least 3 months to lose!

When Ogden says clean ones are hard<br>
He knows 'cause he's one great bard.<br>

Give up even tryin'.<br>

This blizzrd's so bad it's not funny!<br>

Snuggled up close to my honey!

He failed nature's test<br>
Wore a scarf through the rest<br>
And escaped with a nick and some pain.

Lim. E. Rick</a> writes 1/6</h3>
As a writer of limericks naughty<br>
(I've penned about 30 or faughty)<br>
It's much harder, old bean<br>
To write squeaky clean<br>
That's what MY experience taught me.<p>
<b>The Sage nods.</b> - <i>How true...</i>

A new year, a brand new beginning<br>
No sulking, no swearing, no sinning!<br>
Though that's just how I feel<br>
With intentions quite real,<br>
Those who know me - they just can't help grinning!

<h3>CeeJay writes 1/5</h3>
In Texas (embarrassed, I think,<br>
That his freezer had gone on the blink)<br>
My host said, en passant,<br>
"Round here, if it hasn't<br>
Got ice in, it isn't a drink!"

And everyone said<br>
He ought to stick to haiku...

A lady whose teeth they do gleam.<br>
You can turn out the lights,<br>
Close her mouth up tight<br>
But boy, do those teeth still beam!

A student once had the ambition<br>
Of becoming a medical technician.<br>
But med schools were so strict<br>
Folks were dying to get picked<br>

There once was a woman from Mars<br>
Who only ate candy bars<br>
Her figure was nice<br>
'Cause she ate no rice<br>
And hated the taste of the stars.
