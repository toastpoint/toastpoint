<h3>Scribbler writes 09/29/96</h3>
The Republicans, at a convention,<br>
Saw ID4 at one of their functions<br>
Liz said to Bob<br>
Here's how to get you that job<br>
Bomb the White House and remove the opposition!

<hr>
<h3>The Alien writes 09/25/96</h3>
I once had a little pen pal friend<br>
Her friendship rules I never did understand<br>
I said a few things impossible to mend<br>
There were no more letters I could send<br>
Our friendship came to a beautiful end.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Limerickery on the run."  The Sage replies, "Well, aside from the structure."</i>

<h3>Stene Svensson writes 09/24/96</h3>

There was a young scoundrel called Ace<br>
Whose nose was as big as his face<br>
Whenever he blew it<br>
It played "How d'ya do it"<br>
And contacted life forms in space.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This limerick would be better using a more well-known song with 
the same amount of syllables as "How d'ya do it"."</i>   
<a href=mailto:erique@ix.netcom.com>Any suggestions?</a>
<p>
<I>"Howdy Doody" was suggested by Robert Davies, but it doesn't rhyme... (sorry, Robert, for the XXX - couldn't find your letter)</I>

<hr>
<h3>Quilis writes 09/20/96</h3>
Pity poor Robert J. Dole<br>
A decent, respectable soul<br>
But, when he took that tumble<br>
It paralleled his tumble<br>
In the latest CNN voter poll.
<p>
For the Kansan don't shed any tears<br>
In the Senate he had some good years<br>
But Clinton can smile<br>
'Cause he'll win by a mile<br>
And soon can announce, "FOUR MORE YEARS!"

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:wrdoern@pathcom.com>Bill Doern</a> writes 09/16/96</h3>
The preacher was right full of heat<br>
As he called on his people to beat<br>
The temptations they face<br>
By taking God's grace<br>
And so had the saints on their feet!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:udpphillips@cc.memphis.edu>ExpoBeau</a> writes 09/16/96</h3>
There once was a guy without ham<br>
Who never could open his jam.<br>
He pulled and tugged with all his might,<br>
But could never get it right.<br>
Well, I guess he'll never experience SPAM!!!!!!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:wrdoern@pathcom.com>Bill Doern</a> writes 09/15/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There was a young lad at the lake<br>
With a build that was too much to take.<br>
He had rippling biceps,<br>
Pectorals and triceps,<br>
And buttocks that had to be fake!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:stan.mckean@kc.grapevine.com>The Barbed Bard</a> writes 09/14/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A nearsighted butcher named Warders<br>
Suffered various optic disorders<br>
And as he grew blinder<br>
Backed into his grinder<br>
And got a little behind on his orders.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:dowe@powerweb.net>Erin Dowe</a> writes 09/14/96</h3>
The Republicans at a convention - <br>
Everyone can feel the high tension.<br>
For Elizabeth Dole<br>
Hoping to raise Bob in the poll<br>
For Bob she forgot to mention

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:limerick@casagrande.com>Mr.Limerick</a> writes 09/07/96</h3>
A linguist from down in Berea<br>
Told her lover,"I have an idea.<br>
"I'm pregnant with three,<br>
So their names shall be...<br>
Ono and Mato and Poeia."
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Govindhan Padmavijayam writes 09/06/96</h3>
Saddam never learns his lesson<br>
Missile after missile attack his garrison<br>
  While his country is in flames,<br>
  "They'll pay for this!", he claims,<br>
With his antique Smith and Wesson.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:arachno32096@prodigy.com>Arachnotron</a> shares a classic 09/04/96</h3>
There once was a man with a beard<br>
Who said, "Oh, it's just as I feared,<br>
2 Larks and a hen,<br>
3 Hawks and a wren,<br>
Have all built their nests in my beard!"

<hr>
<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 09/03/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Life on Mars? In the quest, science falters - <br>
With each probe, the scenario alters.<br>
Are they huge hulking masses?<br>
Or eggplants with glasses?<br>
My hope is for Mars babes in halters!
