<h3>Writerman writes 12/31/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Ms. Nooky, your mere name inspires<br>
The outbreak of sexual fires!<br>
So this writer man begs<br>
You to open your legs -<br>
And satisfy all my desires!

<hr>
<h3>Nooky writes 12/30/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
To Og, with cock like a steer,<br>
To all those decidedly queer,<br>
And to each Toast Point poet<br>
I bend down and blow it -<br>
To wish you a happy new year!
<p>
You've sampled each holiday cookie,<br>
Called in sick (nothing like playing hooky),<br>
But the neatest new treat<br>
(Sure beats beating your meat)<br>
Is eating the sweetmeat named Nooky!

<h3>Dan'l writes 12/30/96</h3>
There once was a prudish young lass<br>
Who was taught that she gas mustn't pass.<br>
Her boy friend, one night,<br>
Blew high as a kite<br>
When he mistook her cunt for her ass!

<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 12/29/96</h3>
<h4>A Family Affair</h4>
Dressed in spandex and leather<br>
Mom tickles Dad's cock with a feather<br>
While Sis eats her mother<br>
Dad cornholes her brother<br>
And they end up all coming.... together!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The act is called:  The Sophisticates!"</i>

<h4>WRITERMAN'S NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY</h4>
New Year's Eve is here!  Are you hearty...???<br>
You're invited to Writerman's Party!<br>
It's a fifteen-day cruise -<br>
With FREE Sex, Food and Booze!!!<br>
But the boat left yesterday... smartie.

<h3><a href=mailto:mcollins@tsa.com>Mad Max</a> writes 12/27/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There was a young lady from Texas<br>
That bobbed my knob in her Lexus.<br>
I said  "you do that good,<br>
As a dick nibbler should<br>
Ah, ladies from Texas perplex us!
<p>
I saw a young girl at the counter<br>
And at once I wanted to mount her<br>
I settled instead<br>
For some good hot head,<br>
With her dress all crumpled around her.
<p>
There once was a tattooed young biker<br>
That came up on a lovely young hiker<br>
When asked for a ride<br>
He leaned to the side<br>
And said "cum on, climb on my vibrator."
<p>
<i>Vibrator?</i>
<p>
I once met a spirited young lesbian<br>
That fancied herself a thespian.<br>
The lines she rehearsed,<br>
But she ad libbed a verse<br>
That tale-spinning lesbian thespian!

<h3>Jeeves writes 12/24/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I looked out my window last night<br>
And witnessed one hell of a sight<br>
'Twas the big man in red<br>
Giving Rudolph some head<br>
With an elf jacking off on the right!

<hr>
<h3>Franciscus Maximus shares a classic 12/24/96</h3>
A strapping young fella named Clyde<br>
Fell into a sewer and died<br>
The next day his brother<br>
Fell into another<br>
And now they're interred side by side!
<p>
<I>Get it?</I>

<hr>
<h3>Wandering Loon writes 12/23/96</h3>
There's a lovely young lady named Donna.<br>
Most fellows who see her would wanna.<br>
Although she seems naive,<br>
She will rapidly leave,<br>
If ever one thinks he is gonna!

<h3>Jeeves writes 12/22/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Poor Writerman delirious with flu<br>
Makes us a wish, but with nary a clue<br>
A 20 inch cock up my can?<br>
Nay, my good man -<br>
My wife's cunt will certainly do!
<p>
Oh, Bill Ron, you think yourself funny<br>
And go on like the Energizer Bunny<br>
But since Christmas is here<br>
I want to wish you good cheer<br>
And tell you your wife's cunt is quite runny!
<p>
<i>Ewwwww....</i>

<h3>Santa's horny little elf shares a classic 12/21/96</h3>
'Twas the night before Christmas<br>
And all through the house<br>
Everyone felt shitty<br>
Even the mouse<br>
My mom in the whorehouse<br>
My dad smoking grass<br>
I just settled down<br>
With a nice piece of ass<br>
When out on the lawn<br>
There arose such a clatter<br>
I sprang from me bed<br>
To see what was the matter<br>
Out on the lawn<br>
I saw a fat prick<br>
And I knew in a second<br>
It must be St. Nick<br>
Down the chimney he came<br>
Like a bat out of hell<br>
And I knew in a second<br>
The fat bastard fell<br>
He stuffed all the stockings<br>
With Twinkies and beer<br>
And a big rubber dick<br>
For my brother the queer<br>
Up the chimney he rose<br>
With a thunderous fart<br>
That son of a bitch<br>
Blew the chimney apart<br>
He swore and he cursed<br>
As he shot out of sight<br>
Piss on you all<br>
Have one hell of a night!<br>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I realize that this is not a Limerick, but it had me laughing my ass off.  Merry Christmas!"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 12/20/96</h3>
There once was a man from Mynot<br>
Who drank a  barrel of snot<br>
He flavored it with sugar<br>
But it still turned to a booger<br>
And a slimy green he got.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This poem is dedicated to those who have 
tried to out-nasty Bill Ron.  Can
anyone do it without a personal barb?"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 12/20/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
While discussing H. P. Lovecraft in class<br>
I developed some demonic gas.<br>
From the lecture I ran,<br>
Barely mounted the can<br>
When Cthulhu shot out of my ass!

<hr>
<h3>Premer writes 12/20/96</h3>
da dadada dadada da<br>
da dadada dadada da<br>
da dadada da<br>
da dadada da<br>
da dadada dadada da
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I know it's not dirty, but maybe if the cretinous Bill Ron (what's with
the 2 first names - I guess he inherited his lack of creativity from his
parents) would memorize this, he might be able to gradually improve his
his sense of meter, although I doubt it."</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point hopes that Premer's skeletal limerick serves as an example to all.</i>

We are nearing the end of the year<br>
So I wish all the Limerists here:<br>
Great guidance from heaven...<br>
A great Ninety-Seven...<br>
And a twenty-inch cock up your rear!!!
<p>
<i>Um....thanks, Og...</i>

<h3><a name="martin">Laughing Stock</a> writes 12/19/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
The impetuous young Martin from Messina<br>
Wanted to impress his Christina,<br>
So he jumped over a fence<br>
Which was just too high, hence<br>
The change of name to Martina!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "After reading some naughty limericks, I decided this one really was squeaky clean. Am I right? (I usually write limericks in my mother tongue, Afrikaans. This one was born in Afrikaans, but reworked into English and I feel it actually works better that way.)"</i>
<p>
<I>After deliberation, the Sage placed it in the naughty section, since it is the true definition of "naughty" - it's not dirty, it's just 'nudge nudge wink wink'!"</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 12/19/96</h3>
Jeeves, Jeeves, you witless shit<br>
Your barbs don't faze me a bit<br>
Your slanderous rhyme<br>
Are a waste of time<br>
And amount to no more than pointless spit!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This poem is dedicated to an obvious failing of the Darwinian theory of
selectivity of only the best. As a matter of fact, Jeeves may be the 
ultimate failure of the test. Sometimes a breakage of the DNA helical
bond even yeilds a mutant that can use a pencil. Or, did he write his 
poem with the aid of someone else's stencil?"</i>
<p>
<I>The poet is getting closer to that elusive meter.</I>

<h3>Labodomy writes 12/18/96</h3>
While peeing in the toilet one day,<br>
The water turned blue and part grey,<br>
I must be real sick,<br>
For coming out of my dick,<br>
Was the disease I caught from Aunt May!
<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 12/18/96</h3>
Writerman's caught the damn flu!!!<br>
So what's a poor poet to do?<br>
The die has been casted...<br>
This strain is a bastid!!!<br>
Please don't let THIS happen to you!!!
<p>
<I>Toast Point sympathizes.  Wumpus has been sick for a week.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Phred writes 12/18/96</h3>
There once was a man named Fred Fearley<br>
Who loved his wife Dee very dearly<br>
At first they fucked daily--<br>
Screwed lewdly and gaily--<br>
Now he's lucky to fuck Dee twice yearly!
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 12/17/96</h3>
That nattering nabob Bill Ron<br>
(who's lower than syphilitic rat spawn)<br>
Should be banned from this page<br>
(I appeal to Toast Point and Sage)<br>
'Twould be better if the fuckup were gone!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This asshole is really starting to annoy me..."</i>
<p>
Bill Ron, you're obnoxious and crass<br>
And you need an infusion of class<br>
Only your tiresome boasts<br>
Are worse than your posts<br>
You're truly a pain in the ass!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The author appreciates the priciple of "Freedom of Speech" to which Toast
Point and Sage adhere.  I must point out, however, that our illustrious
forefathers intended this right to extend only to living, breathing humans.
It is quite possible that the subject fails all three criteria."</i><br>
<I>The Toast Point Page's Freedom of Speech principles apply to all beings, unless they're really completely repulsive.  One way or another, Bill Ron's presence obviously livens up the page!</I>
<hr>
<h3>CB writes a way-over-metrical-budget response to all the fuss 12/17</h3>
That out-of-control garrulous sprawling scrofulous rhymster Bill Ron<br>
Has whipped into exceedingly high dudgeon (Faith) Defender and Anon<br>
Because he hasn't a clue about scansion or taste and besides he is so 
astoundingly puerile<br>
That Anon thinks him a moron and even wishes him queer (or at least 
sterile)<br>
So the gene pool might be spared Ron's daughter or son!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 12/15/96</h3>
Anon pops off unabashed<br>
Here is a solution for his apparent problem with gas<br>
Grab both ears firmly - comfortable now pard?<br>
Place your feet apart and pull real hard<br>
The pop you heard was your head coming out of your ass!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Now that was a good bowel movement!"</i>
<p>
Anon once tried to write poetry - how absurd<br>
He mangled verse with mis-use of the verb<br>
I placed his work in my PC and moved it around<br>
Then for some reason it started to turn brown<br>
Oh my gosh, he has morphed into a turd!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Take that you little proctalgia!"</i>
<p>
Oh how we wish The Keeper of The Faith the writer of smut<br>
Could take heed and do safe sex in his vile rut<br>
He could still do blow jobs at abandon<br>
If he would just use a condom<br>
And stick his pencil up his butt
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I bet this just makes your orbicularis quiver, you little cirrhosis on
poetry's liver "</i>
<p>
There once was a man from Kansas City<br>
He dreamed all his life for big, giant titty<br>
He drooled with a grin<br>
As he wiped off his chin<br>
And played with his itty bitty
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a man from Iraq<br>
Whose penis grew out of his back<br>
Whe he got married<br>
His wife he carried<br>
Behind like she was a knapsack!
<p>
There once was a politician from Little Rock<br>
Who screwed every cunt on the block<br>
The troopers did lie<br>
For Arkansas's horniest guy<br>
But he caught clap and they cut off his cock!
<p>
<i>Bill, you've got great concepts, but work on your scansion!</i>

<h3>Writerman writes 12/13/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
While taking some toys off his shelves<br>
Santa caught two of his elves<br>
Each, cock in hand -<br>
Came the strong reprimand:<br>
I said: play "among" - not "with" - yourselves!

<h3>Porphria's Lover writes a something 12/11/96</h3>
I must say it was extraordinary<br>
To hear her scream as I  popped her cherry<br>
I then asked for her name -  she said Kerri,<br>
But before the operation, it was Larry!<br>

<hr>
<h3>Defender of the Faith writes 12/11/96</h3>
Bill Ron is an ignorant fool;<br>
He thinks his stupidity's cool.<br>
I hope he's a queer,<br>
Fucking boys up the rear - <br>
That would keep his genes out of our pool.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Too bad Bill Ron isn't eligible for the Darwin Award."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point looks askance at Defender.  "And what makes you think <b><u>we</u></b> want him?</I>
<hr>
<h3>Phred writes 12/11/96</h3>
A handsome young devil named Fred<br>
Could talk any girl into bed.<br>
But his dick was so long<br>
And incredibly strong<br>
That most were left crippled or dead!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I posted this one a year or two ago, but I needed some more publicity so I'm posting it again."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point welcomes Phred back.  "Where have you been?  We've been <b>worried!"</b></I>
<hr>
<h3>Anon writes 12/11/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
What has happened to poets today?<br>
They've thrown rhyme schemes and meter away.<br>
They fuck up their verses<br>
With meaningless curses.<br>
What's worse is they post every day!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Dedicated to Bill Ron, a truly egregious witling."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point tuts, "Now, now..."</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 12/11/96</h3>
There once was a caninus brownis<br>
That urinated on everything around us<br>
He peed on the trees<br>
And he peed on our knees<br>
So we put the fucker in the poundis!
<p>
Up on the house top landed Old St. Nick<br>
The snow was so deep it was up to his dick<br>
So he stayed on his sleigh<br>
And went on his way<br>
Cheez what a bearded prick!
<p>
<I>What does Santa <b>do</b> with those lists of naughty boys and girls, anyway?</I>
<p>
Why is Rudolph's nose so red?<br>
Think - if you were in front and had led<br>
Eight horny raindeer all through the night<br>
Maybe your ass would be drawn up very tight<br>
If Donner's dick was where you thought was his head!
<p>
<I>The scansion needs work, but great concept!</I>
<p>
There once was a man from Garboloty<br>
Who delved in contemptuous scatology<br>
He dished out disgustin crud<br>
And slung scandalous mud<br>
Then he became a subject of psychology.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There once was a whore from Miami<br>
Whose cunt was big and clammy<br>
After finishing her last trick<br>
With a John with a small dick,<br>
She said "How I wish for a stick of salami!"

<i>The poet comments, "Missing for a while but my production of vile is still on par with anyone's
Star."</i>

There once was a man from Cheroot<br>
Who had 10 warts removed from his root<br>
Now when he pees<br>
He puts his fingers on these<br>
And plays his root like a flute!
<p>
<h3>and sings a modified classic...</h3>
Over the river and through the woods<br>
To Gramma's house we go<br>
The weather is rotten<br>
And we have gotten<br>
Stuck in the fuckin' snow!

Another fan letter?!!! Hey, fellahs...<br>
My head's swelling up - like umbrellas!<br>
I mean the "head" that I show - <br>
Not the "head" down below...<br>

There once was a man with an enormous dong<br>
She would scream because it was so long<br>
She was shocked to find<br>
He went up her behind,<br>
But oh' how she didn't mind.

My wife was scratching her ass.<br>
With a blade or two of some grass,<br>
She let out a fart,<br>

I had warned "It wouldn't be nice",<br>
He had argued "Urgency, not any vice",<br>
Armstrong and bladder weak,<br>
He had to take that leak,<br>

<h4>by Michael Weinstein </h4>
There was a young girl with a fiddle,<br>
Who sat down too hard on its middle. <br>
Because of the strings<br>
And a few other things, <br>
It marked her behind like a griddle.
<p>
A singer named Boris from Yale<br>
Could hit a high C without fail. <br>
And furthermore, Boris's<br>
Eight sisters' clitoris's<br>
When tweaked played the musical scale.
 <p>
<h4>by Margaret A. Murdock</h4>
A major league pitcher named Clyde<br>
Had a terrible spat with his bride. <br>
It seems her reproaches<br>
Are the same as his coach's; <br>
His balls are too high and inside.
<p> 
<h4>by Ken Elrod</h4>
A gorgeous young girl from the West<br>
Had hair all over her chest. <br>
It wasn't too pretty<br>
But each little titty<br>
Looked just like an egg in the nest.
 <p>
<h4>by James Wade</h4>
A celibate curate named Way<br>
Fell from grace in the vestry one day. <br>
It had come to his pass: <br>
He'd a lack and a lass... <br>
And Way-laid her and paid her, they say.

<h4>by Thomas A. Quinine</h4>
The miniskirt worn by Miss Kress<br>
Is the world's shortest mini, I guess. <br>
She sat down once in school, <br>
On a fresh painted stool, <br>
Yet got up with no paint on her dress.

<a href=#billron>Bill Ron's response</a> is quite long - <br>
When "writing", he must smoke a bong.<br>
For his meter-less verse<br>
Makes true poets curse<br>

Two cannibals out in Bengal<br>
Were eating a preacher named Paul. <br>
"How's it going there, Fred?" <br>
Said the man at the head. <br>
Said the other, "I'm having a ball!"

The first fellow stood up aghast, <br>
Observing his comrade's repast. <br>
"Slow down," he said, "Fred, <br>
For I'm still at the head. <br>

No wonder the ancient Acropolis<br>
Was filled with the masculine populis, <br>
For the place did abound<br>
With the statues in round<br>
Of full-bosomed beauties, all topulis.
<h4> by Margaret A. Murdock</h4>
There once was a bosom humongous<br>
That caused quite a furor among us. <br>

Until late last week, <br>
When we heard it was caused by a fungus.

A hermit who lived all alone<br>
Had never been sucked on or blown. <br>

Every time he sat on the throne.

At a nudist camp outside Spokane, <br>
The bride appeared wearing a tan. <br>
There was no need to stare<br>
To be fully aware<br>
Of exactly who was the best man.

<h4>by Pedro J. Saavedra </h4>
A skinny young lass on a whim<br>
One morning went topless to swim.<br>
The men she'd have wowed<br>
Thought her underendowed,<br>
And many took her for a him!
<p>
<h4>by Albin Chaplin</h4>
A maid with a cherry was Richter,<br>
Forlorn because no one had nicked her.<br>
So she climbed up a tree<br>
Where the cherries would be;<br>
A mechanical picker then picked her.
<p>
The cat in the rocket was curled<br>
And out into space it was hurled. <br>
Its owner, Miss May, <br>
In truth could now say<br>
That her pussy was out of this world!

Oh, I love to sing bad G&S<br>
Billy's words I can really compress<br>
Till they're so small and shiny,<br>
They fit in your heinie -<br>
Well, they're pearls, and improve the address!

<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes a <a name="billron">vitriolic</a> super-limerical poem 12/01/96</h3>
There once was a load named <a href=nau1196.html#browndog>Brown Dog</a><br>
Whose poetry lays on the road like a dead log<br>
It will just lay there and stank<br>
Because his poems are so rank<br>
But Bill Ron's prose covers the smell<br>
Which wrankles our nose - do tell<br>
And Brown Dog surely does know it<br>
That he can take Bill Ron's tool and go blow it!<br>
For Bill Ron is the consummate poet<br>
And Brown Dog does damn well know it!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yo, Brown Dog
Your attempt at banding an assimilation of enfatuous words is
a vain effort of prose compilation and falls grossly short of
pentamic endeavor.
In other words - it sucks!"</i>
