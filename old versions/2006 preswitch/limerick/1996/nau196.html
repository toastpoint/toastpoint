Biro, I think,</a> writes 1/30</h3>
Miss Muffet's not happy today<br>
As, whilst eating her curds and whey,<br>
There came down a spider<br>
That soon got inside her<br>
And discovered vaginal decay!
<p>
<b>The Sage gets it, after Toast Point explains that "Biro", in England, is 
the brand name of a pen.  Toast Point learned this from the Hitchhiker's Guide 
Series.</b>

<h3>Sylvie writes 1/30</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Sylvie adores her computer<br>
As it serves forth each virtual suitor.<br>
They diddle with text;<br>
What will they say next,<br>
With their limericks lewder and lewder?
<p>
Charl's gone, and now Og's in a funk,<br>
Surveying his too-empty bunk.<br>
Anon's feeling like mud,<br>
Stan is pulling his pud,<br>
But Sylvie's in search of a hunk!
<p>
Whether you like it or not,<br>
Stan, I have one helluva twat!<br>
So Sport, no more waiting,<br>
I'm anticipating<br>
Giving you all that I've got!
<p>
Sylvie, after a tad too much wine<br>
Was arrested for rhyming with nine.<br>
She said, "Judge, you're so cute<br>
"I'll just have to reboot;<br>
"But I do adore coming on-line!"

<h3>Writerman writes 1/30</h3>
Time to get me a life<br>
And elude this everyday strife!<br>

So I'll get up the balls<br>
To divorce my inflatable wife!
<hr>

<h3>Phred writes 1/30</h3>
An embarrassed young lady (not Charlotte)<br>
Made her income by playing the harlot,<br>
   But when something would stink<br>
   She would blush a bright pink<br>
So the harlot's nickname became Scarlet.

<h3>Old Timer shares a classic 1/29</h3>

<h3>OgThePoet writes 1/29</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Mill Dew shares a classic 1/29</h3>

<h3>Stan writes 1/28</h3>

Sally strattles shooting stars every night just before bed,<br>
When the moon shifts and the planet spins we turn to Fred.<br>
Fred looking up through the sky sees the galliant Sally.<br>
Sally drops two pieces of doody upon Fred's bed spread.<br>
When Fred smells the doody he shoots a fart clear to the moon.

<b>The Sage is appalled, not by the content, but by the complete lack of 
attention to limerick format.</b>

<h3>Richard Wall writes 1/24</h3>

Two apes and a shrew<br>
With room for at least seven guys!

To your ear, if you hold up a shell,<br>

But you'll find you've got<br>
A lot more with a twat...<br>
Not only the sound, but the smell!

<h3>Rmac writes 1/20</h3>
A lonely young lass named Louise<br>
Could surely attract men with ease ...<br>
Except for the presence<br>
In her adolescence<br>
Of zits from her tits to her knees.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A limerick flame war?  How quaint!<br>
Like the stuff in the newsgroups this ain't,<br>
Since maintaining a schism<br>
In correct rhyme and rhythm,<br>
Imposes unusual contraints.

<h3>Little Richard writes 1/19</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Ginger, a girl from Laguna<br>
Wore a merkin all lined with vicuna<br>
But if you nuzzle her quiff<br>
And take only one sniff<br>
You'll find it still smells like a tuna!
<p>
<b>Toast Point notes:</b>  <i>See the <a href=#wtp>Wumpus/Toast Point collaboration</a> above...</i>
<p>
As he entered her muff for a dive<br>
He said, "it's on Ginger's pussy I thrive"<br>
"Her bush if real boss<br>
You can use it to floss<br>
And her quiff smells like Chanel No. 5"
<p>
Ginger's pussy is rated a ten<br>
He said with his face in a grin<br>
It's firm and it's tight<br>
An incredible sight<br>
"I want it again and again"!

Charl</a> writes 1/19</h3>
Writhin' so busy with six horny men<br>
That would be Charlotte's idea of heaven.<br>
They'd share a few tricks<br>
And all get some licks.<br>
Cummin' together again & again!

<h3>F.D. Zone writes 1/19</h3>
A farmer from southern Belize<br>
Invented a new kind of cheese<br>
By a curious suction<br>
Flatulence production<br>
Is discharged as inaudible breeze.

<hr>
<h3>Stan writes 1/19</h3>
Anonymous may be your pen name<br>
And diatribe may well be your game<br>
You've attacked me in rhyme<br>
While you muck in your slime<br>
But your limericks still put you to shame
<p>
Come out from the closet, you cad!<br>
Or are you afraid to be spotted unclad?<br>
Will the folks find you silly<br>
With your wee little willie?<br>
Now please don't you go away mad!

<h3>Ogden Nield writes 1/19</h3>

So Wumpus would say to five, Nix?<br>
This problem is easy to fix.<br>
How does this sound?<br>
Just look around ...<br>
Add him to make the group six!

<h3>OG writes 1/18</h3>
One thing the lady's made clear:<br>
She'll fuck anything that comes near!<br>
Apes, dogs, hyenas -<br>
If they've got a penis<br>
She's got their pussy right here!
<p>
Tried to save the lady from rape -<br>
Her reaction left me agape -<br>
When the lady in question<br>
Gave me this suggestion:<br>
I'm enjoying my rape, you big ape!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Said the lady to all of her men<br>
"I've rated you all 1 to 10 -<br>
Not inches, but points,<br>
So the size of your joints<br>
Doesn't matter."  Oh really?  Since when?

Og said, "Like it or not,<br>
This is all that I've got!<br>
Get your Whopper at old Burger King!"

<hr>
<h3>Mr Blister writes 1/18</h3>
The honorable judge Boyd's<br>
Ass was bristling with hemorrhoids<br>
Too bad 'cause he was gay<br>
So it's almost needless to say<br>
He got no compensation from Lloyd's.

Is it true that you frolic with jello?<br>
It's far better to find a young fellow<br>
Certainly it's true<br>
They're much firmer, too<br>
And you don't have to scrub off the yellow!

David Youngs</a> writes 1/17</h3>
There once was a remarkable stripper<br>
Who never had time for a zipper<br>
She'd rip off her dress<br>
Exposing her breasts<br>
And wait for the young men to tip her.

<hr>
<h3>Anon writes 1/17</h3>
I'd love to screw Charlotte so sweet,<br>
Her pussy's my fantasy treat.<br>
So when Ogden and Stan<br>
Try to fight man-to-man,<br>
She and I will be warmed by love's heat.

<p>
Anonymous, you understand?<br>
Og says that you aren't that grand!<br>
He says it's a mistake<br>
That trouble you will make.<br>
He demands you release me, unhand!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
But Ogden, I wasn't offended.<br>
Too soon this affair would be ended.<br>
He could be the one<br>
To bring me some fun<br>
And leave me quite truly contented! :-)

Richard and Ginger can play<br>
Morning and night through the day.<br>
The window is open.<br>
A guest they are hopin'.<br>
To watch or to join - they don't say.

Ginger is ready to cum.<br>
Listen and you'll hear her hum.<br>
It's nearly an hour.<br>
Thank god he's got power.<br>
Longer and Dick would be numb!

<h3>Toast Point writes 1/17</h3>
Our Charlotte deserves highest praise<br>
For being the hottest of lays,<br>
But Ogden and Stanley<br>
Both sound very manly<br>
Intriguing to some of us gays!<p>

Perhaps just a party of five...<br>
Atop a huge bed we could writhe<br>
Charl, Toast, Og and Stan<br>
And Anonymous Man<br>

We debowel and castrate him<br>
"Anonymous" - you raped the wrong garl!
<p>
He's "Anonymous" - (easy to be)<br>
