<h3>Sandman writes 06/30/96</h3>
Pondering on thoughts sublime<br>
Never alone, yet alone all the time<br>
Living in a dream<br>
Of images unseen<br>
Surreal in a slow-motion mime
<p>
<i>Oooo...</i>
<hr>
<a name="langston"><h3>Langston writes 06/29/96</h3></a>
There was an anarchist from Maine;<br>
Many people thought him insane.<br>
As he lit up the flag,<br>
That nasty, sh*t rag,<br>
He'd tell of the masses in pain.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "**** the system."
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:thepoet@icanect.net>Writerman</a> writes 06/23/96</h3>
The Polish Mailbomber's retired -<br>
But the rumor is that he was fired!<br>
Seems the poor dope<br>
Wrote on each envelope:<br>
SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED!!!

On the plane next to me sat Sylvester,<br>
4 years old and a real patience-tester!<br>
My nerves he so tested,<br>
I had him arrested<br>
For being an ADULT molester!
<p>
A man sipping double martinis<br>
Walked into Oleg Cassini's<br>
Ordered sixty-three suits<br>
And nine pairs of boots<br>
And one pair "stoned-wash" blue jeanies!
<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 06/21/96</h3>
A comedian fellow named Downing<br>
Spent his life being onstage and clowning<br>
After blowing one-nighters<br>
He called to his writers:<br>
"Throw me a line, guys-- I'm drowning!"

The election in Russia is tight - <br>
Looks like Yeltsin is in for a fight!<br>
But if man number three<br>
Were to answer his plea,<br>
Victory could be in sight!
<p>
There is a ball player named Belle<br>
Whose temper has been known to swell<br>
His demeaner's the pits<br>
Cause he takes lots of fits<br>
And at fans he's been known to yell!!
<p>
<i>The poet informs us that there is also another Eric Peterson who was an actor on the popular Canadian
drama "Street Legal".   Hmmm.  There was an Eric Peterson who did a one-man show at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. when Toast Point was in high school - wonder if it was the same one?

<h3>Gibson writes 06/17/96</h3>

There once was a fine boy named Michael,<br>
Whose girlfriend, being very insightful,<br>

Try Fred Legget's Tea of West Styx.<br>
In your stomach, 'twill surely do tricks,<br>
And its greatest surprise<br>
'Sthat it breeds butterflies,<br>
And it tastes like they make it from bricks!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Probably the first advertising limerick ever 
written, and hopefully the last!"</i>

There once was a fellow from the Bosphorous<br>

A lighting form which both found prepost'rous.

"No, a twin" he said, he hadn't known one,<br>

Of my thumb or my liver,<br>
'Cause you know that it takes one to CLONE one!"

I tied the rope round my neck with due care.<br>
Wrote the note - "Life is just not fair"<br>
The last thing in my life<br>
Was the nagging voice of my wife -<br>
"Please take your feet off my chair"

Have all built their nests in my beard!

<h3>Brains writes 06/06/96</h3>
There once was a man from Earth,<br>

And that's when he named himself Perth!

<hr>
<h3>Patti writes 06/06/96</h3>

And now I am eating sea rations!

My VISA! Oh, no, it's expired!<br>

For some people this could be a bore<br>
Now I can't use my VISA any more!

<hr>
<h3>Brains writes 06/04/96</h3>
There once was a man named Steve<br>

And that's when he started to sneeze!

<h3>Fred Jones writes 06/03/96</h3>
A goldfish, a cat and a puppy<br>
All decided to murder a yuppie<br>
But sadly for them<br>
This yuppie had phlegm<br>
And they died instead of the yuppie!

Exploring not quite where she oughter<br>
