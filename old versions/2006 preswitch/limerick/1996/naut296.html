<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a woman named Shannon<br>
Whose cunt was the size of a cannon.<br>
I heard a great slurp,<br>
And a massive burp,<br>
As she sat on a cup full of Dannon....

<h3>Kivi writes 02/26/96</h3>

There once was a young man named Enus,<br>
Who had two balls but no penis<br>
A eunuch he wed,<br>
And in bed he said,<br>
"We have a complete set between us"

<h3>Schling-A-Schlong writes 02/24/96</h3>
Tim had traveled to Peru<br>
In search of the ultimate screw<br>
When his trip was complete<br>
He zipped up his meat<br>
And said to the ladies, "Thank you!"
<p>
<i>Toast Point sings:</i>
<i>Schling, schling a schlong,<br>
Make it sinful, to last the whole night long<br>
Don't worry that it's not big enough<br>
For anyone else to feel<br>
Just schling, schling a schlong!</i>

<h3>A Sick Cheerleader writes 02/24/96</h3>

Everybody Masturbate!<br>
Breathe deep and moan<br>
Scream loud and groan<br>
Until you ejaculate!!

Priscilla, her breasts bouncing gaily,<br>
Joined forces with Barnum and Bailey;<br>
She went down on a clown<br>
(T'was the talk of the town!)<br>
Want more details?  Email me!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Touche, Jill, you got me, my dear<br>
And you might fake the moans that I hear...<br>
But there's no way to hide<br>
Your true feelings inside,<br>
When your thighs clamp so tight round my ears!
<p>
True orgasms from you I shall win<br>
And I say this while wiping my chin,<br>
For only I know<br>
How your juices DO flow - <br>
There's no faking that wetness within!

A French necrophiliac called Jacques<br>
Was doing a corpse in a truck.<br>
As they passed East Berlin,<br>
Rigor mortis set in,<br>
And the poor little froggie was stuck!
<p>
There was a young athlete called Pete<br>
Whose sex life began in the street - <br>
Jogging round Piccadilly<br>
He felt stiff in his willie<br>
And mounted the bobby on beat!

<h3><a href=mailto:tim@raptor.lpl.arizona.edu>Tim</a> writes 02/22/96</h3>
A young Catholic they caught masturbating<br>
Was told "It's sinful, your sperm to be wasting".<br>
"Fret not!", said the lad;<br>
"I haven't been bad<br>
I've been saving it all in this waste bin"
<p>
A horny Italian pastor<br>
At cunnilingus was a master;<br>
"When they lie on their backs<br>
And I lick at their cracks<br>
They wiggle and squirm just like pasta!"

Lovs2Laf  - the love shows through your words,<br>
But to think I'm that huge is absurd!<br>
You're a CPA lass;<br>
I'd never fit in your ass,<br>
If my dick were as small as a bird's!
<p>
Jill dear, you now have me back<br>
With all of my hardness intact;<br>
Your tongue is stupendous<br>
And lips so tremendous<br>
My vision is fading to black!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Though I don't carry all that much girth,<br>
Making love to you's heaven on Earth!<br>
When up go your knees,<br>
The way that you squeeze<br>
Just milks me for all that it's worth!!

<hr>
<h3>Lovs2Laf writes 02/22/96</h3>
John, come to my home, lick and tease me!<br>
I need someone here who can please me!<br>
I want you inside,<br>
My legs are spread wide,<br>
And you know just how to release me!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
My butt sliding down on your face,<br>
Dressed up in black stockings of lace,<br>
Get me dripping wet,<br>
Your tongue deeper yet,<br>
My god, this is my favorite place!
<p>
If my offer you're tempted to take,<br>
We can meet down at Table Rock Lake - <br>
On the water, it's nice<br>
(a hotel would suffice) - <br>
I promise an orgasm I'll fake!

<hr>
<h3>John can't let that go and writes 02/22/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Very funny m' dear, "Ha, ha, ha",<br>
I'm sure you've made people guffaw!<br>
You say thimble's the size<br>
Of the bump 'tween my thighs,<br>
But aren't those the size cups in your bra?
<hr>
<h3>Jill writes 2/22/96</h3>
John is not quick, John is not nimble,<br>
His little dick fits in a thimble!<br>
This being so true,<br>
if only you knew,<br>
You'd laugh til your body did tremble!
<hr>

<h3>Jill apologizes to John 02/22/96</h3>
I'm such a liar!  This you will see<br>
As finally the truth comes out of me - <br>
John, I still love you,<br>
No one's above you<br>
And forgiving is how you must be!

<h3>Writerman writes 02/22/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Jack was once known as Big Dipper,<br>
Till his dipper got caught in his zipper!<br>
It's hard not to laugh,<br>
But he zipped it in half,<br>
And now he's called Jack The Ripper!
<p>
<i>Toast Point crosses his legs in sympathy.</i>

<h3>Lovs2Laf replies to Da Homer 02/21/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
John, JOHN! Get your ass back in bed!<br>
I like that thing hard, not soft instead!<br>
With my tongue I'll go 'round,<br>
Then up and back down<br>
You know I give excellent head!
<p>
John is not nimble, John is not quick,<br>
Due to his large and cumbersome dick!<br>
He often wants anal,<br>
But that would be fatal,<br>
So if seen, you'd best run away quick!

<h3>Stargazer writes 02/21/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A lad lusted after his tutor,<br>
Who tutored him on the computer.<br>
Her talents computable<br>
Made her inscrutable<br>
Up to the day that he scrut her!
<p>
"You must toot your own horn, you can't duck it, kid!<br>
Feed 'em crap 'til it has to be bucketed!"<br>
So by boasting all morn,<br>
Do I "toot my own horn"?<br>
Or is that what the man from Nantucket did?

<h3>Da Homer writes 02/21/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Lovs2Laf has got my mind reeling!<br>
Her lips on my shaft - "what a feeling"!<br>
Runneth over my cup<br>
With the feelings built up - <br>
She'd have me shoot straight to the ceiling!
<p>
Lovs' heart I would like, that's a fact,<br>
And her offer holds much to attract!<br>
I'd spend the whole day<br>
'Tween her legs and just play<br>
And once there, I may never come back!

<hr>
<h3>Lovs2Laf writes 02/21/96</h3>
I'm sorry it takes me a moment<br>
To say things like "fuck", "shit" and "stroke-it",<br>
But get this quite clear - <br>
With me, there's no fear - <br>
I WILL suck it, and lick it, and blow it!
<p>
<i>Oo!</i>

<h3>Pecos Tom shares classics 02/20/96</h3>
There once was this lady from France<br>
Who boarded a train in a trance,<br>
Everyone fucked her,<br>
Except the conductor,<br>
And he shot a load in his pants.
<p>
There once was this lady named Lil,<br>
Who lit dynamite for a thrill - <br>
They found her vagina,<br>
In North Carolina, <br>
And part of her tit in Brazil!
<p>
There once was this lady named Lou<br>
Who filled up her pussy with glue,<br>
She said with a grin,<br>
If you pay to get in,<br>
Then you'll pay to get out of it too!

<h3>Loman writes 02/20/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Priscilla, her breasts bouncing gaily,<br>
Liked to screw with a friendly Israeli.<br>
Just the thought of his shmuck<br>
Got her ready to fuck,<br>
Which they did six or seven times daily!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Three girly-men, all dressed in leather,<br>
Tied Hans und Franz firmly together.<br>
"Pumped them up" all night long<br>
Though they started out strong<br>
Now they're so tired they can't lift a feather!
<p>
There was an old trapper named Dave<br>
Who kept a dead whore in his cave<br>
But he didn't fuck her<br>
Or eat her or suck her;<br>
He just thought it made a nice grave. <i>(did I fool you?)</I>
<p>
<i>The Sage is amused.</i>

<h3>Swede shares a classic 02/20/96</h3>
There was a young mas from Madras<br>
Whose balls were made of pure brass<br>
When he banged them together<br>
They played 'Stormy weather'<br>
And lightning came out of his ass.

Da Homer, my man in C-A,<br>
You are stealing my heart away!<br>
I'd sit on your face<br>
If you'd just name the place,<br>
You please me so much in that way!

On the telly is Ms. Courtney Cox,<br>
Who is really one helluva fox!<br>
You think if I'm hung<br>
And extended my tongue,<br>
She would let me slide into her box?

<h3>Da Homer writes 02/19/96</h3>
The time, 'bout a quarter past three;<br>
Jill's body pressed up against me.<br>
My desire I'm showing,<br>
But she thinks it's annoying,<br>
And yells "Get out of bed, and go pee!!"
<p>
If you like your suits double-breasted<br>
Along with your women big-chested,<br>
The women and suits<br>
Are both in cahoots,<br>
So you better make sure you're well rested!

A hurry-up hooker named Vickie<br>
Was the quintescent queen of the quickie;<br>
She'd do a quick dance,<br>
Make you cum in your pants,<br>
Leaving you sullen and sticky!

There was a male tourist from Norway<br>
Who had sex with a whore in a doorway<br>
Once back in the crowd<br>
He wondered aloud,<br>
"What ever happened to foreplay?"

<h3>Ginger writes 02/18/96</h3>
If Merc could make the world so<br>

"No men left for me... I'm not pleased!"<br>
Said the goddess, not quickly appeased.<br>
"The best ones are taken<br>
Or gay, or forsaken<br>
And the rest of the lot are diseased!
<p>
An uppercrust couple, the Chases<br>
Would make love in some outrageous places<br>
In doorways and halls,<br>
Zoos, restaurants and malls<br>
And even at home in somes cases!

Jan was a hooker, a rookie.<br>
When a man asked to eat her sweet nookie,<br>
She said, "that isn't nice,<br>
But if you ask twice,<br>
I'll give you some milk and a cookie."

<h3>Mercury writes 02/17/96</h3>
If mine were the world to remake,<br>
A couple of liberties I'd take.<br>
No woman corny<br>
Each woman horny<br>
And orgasms that couldn't be faked!

<h3>Mike Hunt shares a number of flatulent classics 02/16/96</h3>
There once was a man named McBride<br>
Who could fart whenever he tried.<br>
In a contest he blew<br>
Two thousand and two!<br>
Then he shit and was disqualified...
<p>
There was a young man of Ragoon<br>
Who farted and filled a balloon<br>
The balloon went so high<br>
It stuck in the sky<br>
And stank out the man in the moon!
<p>
There once was a Royal Marine<br>
Who tried to fart "God Save The Queen"<br>
When he reached the soprano<br>
Out came the guano - <br>
His pants were not fit to be seen!
<p>
There was a musician named Bass<br>
Who played the trombone with his ass.<br>
He put in a trap<br>
To take out the crap<br>
But the vapors corroded the brass!
<p>
There was a young woman named Margo<br>
Who came when they played Handel's "Largo".<br>
But when they played Liszt,<br>
She farted and pissed<br>
Just to show what she thought of such cargo!

Ginger, with buttocks so fair<br>
Invitingly raised in the air,<br>
I hope you don't mind<br>

And come in your sweet derriere!

Sylvie, you're a definite winner<br>
That no one could match as a sinner.<br>
But I'm wondering why,<br>
When eating your pie,<br>
Your cunt tastes so much like Ginger!
<hr>

<h3>Da Homer writes 02/15/96</h3>
Toast Point and Sage I do thank you,<br>
For creating this site, credit's due!<br>
Although I'm not gay,<br>
I think I should say,<br>
If I were Ginger, Syl, or Charl, I would wank you!
<p>
<i>Toast Point grins broadly.  <br>
The Sage looks disapprovingly at the 
incomplete rhyme in line 2.</i>

<h3>Little Richard writes 02/15/96</h3>
Ginger, please pardon my stare...<br>
Your pussy is sweet and so fair!<br>
Your ass is great too,<br>
And if we should screw,<br>
You also sport a great pair!

"Is Netscape the ultimate browser?"<br>
I wondered as I walked my schnauzer<br>
But my schnauzer while browsing<br>
Found this poodle arousing -<br>
Bad dog!  He did more than arouse her!
<hr>
<h3>Da Homer writes 02/14/96</h3>
Da Homer has just joined this crew,<br>
But enjoying the feud and to-do,<br>
So it seems I did miss<br>
Charl's succulent kiss<br>
Marge Simpson may just have to do!
<p>
Sylvie - who is this young lass?<br>
I'm new here, but it's come to pass<br>
That she may be quite fair<br>
With a beautiful pair - <br>
Why are all being pains in the ass?

Ginger's alone with the Skipper,<br>
Though Sir Howell and the Prof want to dip 'er.<br>

But I like Skipper's size<br>
And Howell can't go quite past his zipper".

<h3>and a variation on the classic</h3>
There once was a man from Nantucket<br>
Whose dick was so long he could suck it!<br>
He said, though quite crass<br>
As he lubed up his ass<br>
"I have found a nice place I can tuck it!

<p>
This fellow we all know as Stan<br>
Is a ready-to play-kinda man.<br>
The front door or back,<br>
He even can smack!<br>
Whatever I want, that's his plan!

<h3>Little Richard writes 02/14/96</h3>
Ginger was horny and hot,<br>
Lying nude and supine on her cot.<br>
She yearned for a dick<br>
She could suck on and lick<br>
And a tongue that would tickle her twat!
<hr>
<h3>Ali Chingali shares a classic 02/13/96</h3>
The Duchess once asked with a wink<br>

Achieved by the suction<br>
Was generally thought to improve 'er.

Shot a wad on the bed.

"Naughty" is nice -<br>
But here's some advice -<br>
Let's can the mean-spirited stuff!
<p>
<i>Toast Point and the Sage concur.</i>

<i>Og and Stan!  Here are your lost limericks from Sunday!  They
just showed up Feb. 8!</i>

WRITERMAN</a> writes 2/4</h3>

Sylvie's new boyfriend is pissed!<br>
Wants his girlfriend to cease and desist -<br>
Now that this art you've mastered -<br>
Sylvie, don't let the bastard<br>
Take you from out of our midst!!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Priscilla, her breasts bouncing gaily,<br>
Fooled everyone 'til an Israeli<br>
Squeezed too hard on the pair,<br>
Letting out all the air -<br>
Of balloons she'd been pumping up daily!

<hr>
<h3>Stan writes 2/4</h3>
"With Charl, Sylvie just doesn't rate!",<br>
He observed after only one date.<br>
Her snatch was so wide,<br>
He got lost while inside - <br>
Now ain't that a horrible fate?
<p>
Sylvie's tits were quite rare - <br>
They were covered all over with hair!<br>
Her nipples were long<br>
As a normal man's schlong,<br>
And they whooshed when exposed to the air!
<p>
Sylvie's snatch was so large,<br>
It had room for ten men and a barge!<br>
She could do all the men,<br>
Then come back again<br>
And give them all head with no charge!

By tradition, when guarding their sheep<br>
Shepherds sing, play the panpipes, or sleep.<br>
But Little Boy Blue<br>
Prefers a good screw<br>
In the haystack with Little Bo Peep!
<hr>

<h3>SportsFan writes 02/07/96</h3>
Sylvia, just pick one already<br>
Martin or Og for some heady.<br>
You say you are there<br>
But don't take the dare!<br>
Ahhh, you can go after Phreddy!!
<p>
Syl, don't be afraid to be lickin'<br>
Perhaps you prefer they just stick'em?<br>
The front or the back?<br>
A romp in the sack.<br>
It's time, girl, to get that tongue flickin'!!

<hr>
<h3>The Rightor writes 02/07/96</h3>
There once was a girl from Peru<br>
Who didn't know what she should do<br>
So she sat on her ass<br>
And smoked up some grass<br>
And now she's as ugly as you!
<hr>

<h3>Phred writes 2/7</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
You men really don't need to fight;<br>
Three dicks would fit Sylvie just right.<br>
In her ass and her cunt<br>
And her mouth (What a stunt!)<br>
Then pinch her nose and the girl's water-tight!
<hr>
<h3>The Man writes 2/7</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Sylvie, get down on your knees,<br>
Then give my gonads a squeeze!<br>
Please suck on my dick<br>
'Til it's all wet and slick<br>
And stop being a cyberspace tease!

<hr>
<h3>Richard Wall writes 2/7</h3>
There can be no doubt that Rebecca<br>
For me is a true lover's Mecca!<br>
She will dress up and play,<br>
Groan, moan and sashay -<br>
Her juice tastes just like liquor!
<hr>

<h3>SportsFan writes 2/6</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Oh, Sylvie, don't be such a chicken!<br>
When will you start some dick lickin'?<br>
You say you give head<br>
But it's all talk instead!<br>
Give us some HOT limericking!

Sylvie's CHALLENGE has been seen and noted<br>
And her muff, guys, tastes great - candy-coated!<br>
So if you like sweets<br>
While you're betwixt the sheets -<br>
Better do what the young lady wroted!

Environmentalist</a> writes 2/6</h3>
With his beans, chef Richard did strive<br>
To meet the Clean Air Standards of '95.<br>
But his hot-start emission<br>
Revealed a condition<br>
Of flatulence in overdrive.
<hr>
<h3>Freeman shares a classic 2/6</h3>
There once was a girl named Alice,<br>
Who pissed in the Catholic chalice.<br>
It wasn't for relief, <br>
Or religious belief,<br>
It was pure Presbyterian malice!
<hr>
<h3>Sylvie's back, and she's ready for action 2/5</h3>
The cyber-slut thanks sweet sportsFan,<br>
And of course she adores WriterMan!<br>
She thinks, "Syl, don't be nervous;<br>
These bards you must service;<br>
And who the hell cares about Stan?"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
These poets, with rhythm quite glorious<br>
Crank out lim'ricks the most meritorious!<br>
With pentameter terse<br>
They make jism with verse,<br>
And they make Sylvie feel fine and whore-ious!
<p>
But this party's become too ingrown!<br>
Og and SportsFan their talents have shown;<br>
New guys, show your stuff!<br>
Put your face in my muff,<br>
And try to make Sylvia groan!

<h3>grumpyFoz writes 2/5</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a fellow named Randy<br>
Who thought that K-Y was just dandy!<br>
With a wink and a snicker<br>
He'd lube up his dicker<br>
And slip it in anyone handy.
<hr>

<h3>Ali-Chingale shares a classic non-limerick 2/5</h3>
There once was a young man named Rick, <br>
Who was born with a corkscrew dick. <br>
For the rest of his life he did hunt <br>
For a girl with a corkscrew cunt. <br>
And when he found her he dropped over dead; <br>
The son of a bitch had a left-hand thread!!                       
      
<hr>

<h3>Zeeto shares a classic 2/5</h3>
A pansy who lived in Khartoum<br>
Took a lesbian up to his room;<br>
They argued all night<br>
Over who had the right<br>
To do what and with which and to whom!
<hr>
<h3>Stan writes 2/5</h3>
Sylvie's snatch is bizarre, <br>
The strangest pussy by far!<br>
It is six inches wide<br>
And all furry inside,<br>
With the smell of a overripe gar!
<p>
<i>Toast Point wonders: Gar?</i>

<hr>
<h3>Freeman shares a classic 2/5</h3>
There once was a couple named Kelly,<br>
Who were found stuck belly to belly,<br>
Because in their haste<br>
They had purchased the paste<br>
Instead of petroleum jelly!

<hr>
<h3>SportsFan writes 2/2</h3>
Sylvie's just begging for action -<br>
It shows from her latest reaction.<br>
Honey, it's time that you dare<br>
Show us your sweet derriere<br>
And take in an eager erection!

<hr>
<h3>Sylvia writes 2/1</h3>
Poor flat Lynnie the lottery won,<br>
So she pumped up her tits just for fun.<br>
And now, two weeks post-op<br>
She's enormous up top;<br>
And at long last, her cups over-run!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:writrman@icanect.net>
Ogre</a> writes 2/1</h3>
Sylvie, you're some kind of hot!<br>
You speak of your fabulous twat!<br>
Are you Charlotte's replacement?<br>
Bring that twat to my basement -<br>
And I'll give it all that I've got!
<p>
I like chicks who dig sex very much<br>
It appears that our Sylvie is such<br>
She'll get in between us<br>
And bring off each penis<br>
With her mouth and her twat and her touch!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Sylvie, come out of the cold -<br>
We welcome you into our fold!<br>
Seduce us and use us,<br>
Tease us, abuse us -<br>
You're ours now - to have and to hold!
<p>
The animals here in this zoo<br>
Sylvie, are panting for you<br>
You'll get so much action<br>
You'll end up in traction<br>
Without even O.J. to sue!
