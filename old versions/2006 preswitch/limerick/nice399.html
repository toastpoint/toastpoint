A man who was called Kerouac<br>
Had a secret for writing:  beer, a pack<br>
(Or two) before breakfast,<br>
A visit to the druggist<br>
For lunch, then a bottle, & he hit the sack.

Poor Sylvia Plath was a gel<br>
Who really knew how to excel.<br>
She left behind Devon<br>
And made it to Heaven--<br>
Too bad her fans came, now it's hell.
<p>Miz Plath daily prays, "From my followers<br>
(Those nuts and overwrought wallowers<br>
In anger and blame)<br>
And this misplaced fame,<br>
Please save me; my fans are all hollow hers."

On the day of Professor's bad luck,<br>
The good friar, it seems, also struck<br>
A taxi, a bike,<br>
Two guys on a hike,<br>

His future might be looking dim,<br>
He could soon have more time<br>
For sharing his rhyme<br>
'Cos the cops may be searching for him!
<p>I may have a clue where he went<br>
From the bar where he spent his last cent...<br>
I thought I heard him say,<br>
As I went on my way,<br>
That he had to stop by a convent!

D'ya hope your new-century babe'll<br>
Be born with that First of Jan label?<br>
Then, experts relate,<br>
April 9 is a date<br>
To reserve for romance if you're able!

There once was a boy called Fred<br>
Who loved to stand on his head.<br>
Until one day he found<br>
His head was no longer round<br>
But flat on the top, instead!
<p>There once was a mischievous teacher<br>
Who was quite a ridiculous creature.<br>
She always started her class<br>
Wearing a mysterious mask<br>
And no one could ever get near her.

I sat down with the wife for a chat.<br>
She says, "Dear, do you think I look fat?"<br>
Now, maybe in Reno,<br>
I'd bet the casino...<br>
But, on this one, I think I'll stand pat!
<p>
I responded, "You're perfect, my dear!<br>
But wait... Is that the doorbell I hear?<br>
My stomach is twitchin'...<br>
As you pass the kitchen,<br>
Could you kindly, please fetch me a beer?"
<p>Says the wife, "You know just what to say!<br>
By the way, have you seen the cheese tray?<br>
Sure, I'll get you a brew,<br>
And for myself a few<br>
Of those chocolates from valentines day!"

On promoting their lips &#151<br>
Would-be interns who plan an encore?

There once was a man named Bo.<br>
He had a son-in-law named Joe.<br>
They both married none other<br>
Than Joe's brother's grandmother<br>

Daily swaggered to school, unafraid...<br>
As a general rule,<br>
His dad walked him to school,<br>
Because they were both in the same grade!

Mr Clinton took another big hit,<br>
Was told the decision was not moral or legit,<br>
Was the pilot wrong,<br>
Or is this just a song,<br>
To really give our Dear President a fit.
<p>
Hillary Rodham wants a Senator to be,<br>
She really just wants more money from you and me,<br>
Just more public dole,<br>
Living free is their goal,<br>
But they could have a real fight with Mr Giuliani!

If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He'd rival Andrew Dice Clay.<br>
The Bard was no prude--<br>
In fact, was quite rude,<br>
And wrote many a foul play.

Observer's been down with the flu.<br>
Had my doubts that I would pull through.<br>
Spent some time in the bed<br>
With a bad aching head,<br>
And a few extra hours in the loo!
<p>
But, alas! I have now been revived,<br>
And a new lease on life has arrived!<br>
My medicine chest<br>
Can now take a rest,<br>
I'm so happy to say, "I survived!"

I dinged a parked car - what a shame<br>
And the folks who saw I was to blame<br>
Looked real pleased when I wrote<br>
And left a small note<br>
Which they thought was my number and name!

Conversation I heard after class:<br>
"Why's the bookstore so crowded?" ... "I pass" ...<br>
"There's a book they all want" ...<br>
"Of course &#151 Monica's on't" ...<br>
"No &#151 they're snapping up Walt's 'Leaves of Grass'!"

The Senate voted one hundred to zip,<br>
Can't argue with that, Give no lip,<br>
So where do we go?<br>
What do we know?<br>
This could be a long long trip.
<p>
The ice and snow can slow you down,<br>
Spin your car round and round,<br>
Driveway is slick,<br>
Walking's a trick,<br>
Thoughts of early spring do abound.
<p>
The snow comes drifting from the sky,<br>
It dips and flips like a pretty butterfly,<br>
The air smells clean,<br>
The streets are mean,<br>
The deer go dancing on the sly.

Friendship is a special thing,<br>
A million joys it can bring,<br>
It brightens eyes,<br>
Like sunny skies,<br>
Even the sad will start to sing!
<p>
Gardening is my favorite pastime,<br>
Potatoes and tomatoes sure do rhyme,<br>
Beans are neat,<br>
Onions a treat,<br>
The exercise keeps me in my prime.
<p>An eagle whose wings had been clipped<br>
Has every right to believe he's been gypped,<br>
He now can't proudly fly,<br>
Or sail the sky on the sly,<br>
His greatest power has from him been ripped.

I have a computer that"s all mine,<br>
It gets me to "AOL" all the time,<br>
Sometimes it jumps,<br>
Sometimes it dumps,<br>
But the rest of the time it does just fine.

<p>In July I called Social Security with a smile,<br>
They said I was early, needed to wait a while,<br>
I bided my time,<br>
Surely this is a crime,<br>
Now they say in November my check will be in style.

<i>The poet comments, "Love Social Security too."</i>
<p>If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He might not even want to stay,<br>
The nasty jokes,<br>
The nasty folks,<br>
Might make him want to run away.

His video testimony was sure a dilly,<br>
What is "IS",<br>
The words just fizz,<br>
He makes the Presidency look plain silly.

Impeachable Crimes is the big word,<br>
As far as count, he is the third,<br>

Why won't he just fly like a bird.
