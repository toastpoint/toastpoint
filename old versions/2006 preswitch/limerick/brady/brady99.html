<h2>1999 Entries</h2>

<h2>Here's the story...of a bunch named Brady...</h2>
That squeaky-clean family, the Bradys<br>
Were sent to us straight out of Hades<br>
Their suburban palace<br>
And housekeep named Alice<br>
All serve to make Toast Point a Fraidy!<p>

When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
What she felt made her blush to her toes<br>
She was quick and discreet<br>
But it made her feel neat<br>
For the thing that she felt was his pete.

Marsha and Greg were feuding<br>
Over who gets the attic's rooming<br>
At first Greg won<br>
And Marsha did cum<br>
And greg let her have it, mooning.<br>


<p>
<i>The poet comments, "in the actual episode all the kids were involed in the
feud......"</i>

<h3>Valerie writes 04/28/99</h3>
My favorite character is Mike<br>
Who bought Bobby Brady a bike<br>
But that little man<br>
Ran over Jan<br>
And then she turned into a dyke!
<hr>
<h3>Jennifer L. Kemshaw writes 04/13/99</h3>
There once was a lady named Alice<br>
Who dreamed of a wonderful palace<br>
She became an old nanny<br>
That grew a big fanny<br>
And now is known as calis!!!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I was going to use the "when Marcia embraced Davy Jones" But WHATEVER"</i>

<h3>Swordfish writes 04/05/99</h3>
The youngest female Brady child<br>
Wanted to be older and wild<br>
From Friday through Sunday<br>
Put fish in her undies<br>
And said "Now I'm like Marsha", and smiled!
<p>

He made safety patrol at his school<br>
But Bobby was nobody's fool<br>
If he saw an infraction<br>
Just give him some action -<br>
You'd get off if you got on his tool!
<p>
The whole party had just stopped to stare<br>
At Jan with her new afro hair<br>
She cut out a bald spot<br>
Used that hair for her twat<br>
Her snatch looked like the "bunch" called "Hair Bear"
<p>
In the bathroom the Brady kids share<br>
Peter often would jerk-off in there<br>
Je was stroking his cock<br>
But forgot the door lock<br>
Then Jan entered and he moussed her hair!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Football bounced off her nose, what a sin<br>
In her mind Marsha played it again<br>
But the thought made her sick<br>
'Cause she'd rather have dick<br>
In her mouth while balls bounced off her chin!
<p>
Carol Martin, the new Brady bride<br>
Had three young blonde girls by her side<br>
She sold them as toys<br>
To the young Brady boys<br>
But charged extra to let them inside!
<p>
For Mike Brady three boys ain't enough<br>
So he married a houseful of muff<br>
This great architect<br>
Was always erect<br>
'Cause the kids ran around in the buff
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Alice, the Brady house-keeper<br>
Would brag that no pussy was deeper<br>
She used it for storage<br>
Meat products to porridge<br>
Just like a meat locker, but cheaper!

Jan and Marsh' planned a new function,<br>
Not a Brady dinner or luncheon,<br>
In this script never written,<br>
To gals the girls were smitten,<br>
And hosted a new form of Petticoat Junction.


<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:kbrews@galstar.com>Dionysos</a> writes 03/13/99</h3>
The Bradys sure know who's the boss,<br>
The ol' woman who gathers no moss,<br>
But when Sam isn't givin',<br>
The fam' will be livin',<br>
Without pork chops and applesauce.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Schausz@hotmail.com>Zander Schaus</a> writes 03/08/99</h3>
I think Sam the Butcher might be Greek.<br>
He deals with those Brady's week after week after week<br>
Little Bobby will taunt,<br>
For it's Alice he wants<br>
And that's why he says, "Hey anybody want any Meat!?"
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous shares a classic 02/27/99</h3>
While mowing the Astroturf lawn,<br>
And Marcia looked over the dawn<br>
The Bradys all said<br>
"Let's give her some head"<br>
And they all did that all weekend long!
<hr>
<h3>Norand writes 02/27/99</h3>
Is Alice a bulldyke or what?<br>
We've seen how she looks at the lot<br>
Not Peter or Greg<br>
But at Marcia's leg<br>
And prays fervently for a shot!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Hope it doesn't suck too bad"</i>

<h3>Kitty Carryall writes 02/19/99</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Cindy and Bobby were slighted<br>
To a wedding they were not invited<br>
To the see-saw they go<br>
In hopes Guiness will show<br>
That they refuse to be spited!
<hr>
<h3>Morgie writes 02/10/99</h3>
While pressing her bell-bottomed pants<br>
Marsha decided to dance -<br>
She brushed out her hair <br>
And said "I don't care  <br>
If Doug Simpson doesn't give me a glance!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Some of your poems are sick!!!!
but keep on writing!!!!!!!!!!"</i>
<hr>

<h3>Natasha writes 02/10/99</h3>
While mowing the Astroturf lawn,<br>
Before the break of dawn<br>
Jan hit the rake  <br>
And swallowed a stake<br>
And now her tonsils are gone!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "this is cool "</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:dmcshain@nimbus.temple.edu>Dugan</a> writes 02/02/99</h3>
"It's Marsha that's loved all the time!" <br>
Said Jan on the phone to her mind.<br>
"She is such a whore <br>
My mom should learn more<br>
Of when she went down on Billy Verine!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:njames@okra.deltast.edu>Mystic01_2001</a> writes 01/14/99</h3>
While mowing the Astroturf lawn,<br>
Greg met a cute girl named Ruth Dawn<br>
He said: "Hey groovy chick, <br>
How'd you like me to stick<br>
Something in you that's big, hard, and long?!"


<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sorry to be so vulgar."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Whacked writes 01/13/99</h3>
The kids' bathroom toilet is missing<br>
Twas last seen by greg, while pissing<br>
Marcia exlaimed<br>
Nay, loudly proclaimed<br>
"On what will greg and I do our kissing?"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:atepe@bellatlantic.net>D T</a> writes 01/12/99</h3>
With expertise in architecture<br>
Mike Brady could give a fine lecture<br>
On the erection of houses,<br>
But did I mention his spouse is<br>
A pro at erecting the pecker?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Rhymes are not perfect but..............."</i>
