<H2>Why&nbsp;<A name=toast></A>Toast Point?</H2><B><I>Toast Point</I></B> is a 
term of endearment from my <A 
href="wumpus.html">Wumpus</A>! Once upon a time, when 
the Wumpus and I were dating, we were getting all googly and disgustingly 
adorable and calling each other cute things. After I called him "my little nacho 
chip", he responded with "my little toast point". I thought that was the cutest 
thing ever, and so unique! So there you are. Toast Point is a moniker that works 
much better in print than verbally, though. (Now we call each other "sweetness" 
and "honeyman", if you're curious).

<b>August</b>-<br>
The band's 25th Anniversary concert in May went swimmingly, and we are now starting rehearsals for <u>my last 
season with the band</u> (whoopee!).  Our November concert, all British music, will be entitled <i>Close 
Your Eyes and Think of England</i>.  We're doing a joint holiday concert in December with the New Jersey 
Gay Men's Chorus, and then the spring concert will be my last.  I'm thinking about calling it <i>A Diva's 
Farewell</i> or something...
<p>
The Wumpus and I took my parents on an Alaska cruise in July.  It was absolutely amazing.  You can find both 
trip report and pictures <a href=http://www.toastpoint.com/travel/alaska/alaskavancouver.html>here</a>.

<h2><a name=blog>My Blog</a></h2>
I update my blog regularly, whereas this site does not get updated much at all.   
So here's an attempt to embed the blog <i>in</i> the web page.  I don't really like the way it's displaying, but 
don't have time to fiddle with it.
