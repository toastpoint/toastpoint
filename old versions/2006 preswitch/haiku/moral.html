<h2>Toast Point's Moral Dilemma</h2></center>
<hr>
OK, guys, here's the story.  In 1995, when I was learning HTML one of the fun things I did was to start the haiku contest.  It's been plowing ahead under its own steam and providing mild entertainment for netters for several years now.  Since I set up the contest, my life has 
gotten busier and busier, which has been wonderful, since all the things that keep me busy are 
wonderful things.  The point being, however, that the continuous maintenance of the Haiku Contest and the other contests I run has been more on the chore side than the fun side, because 
I can't just let it sit until I have time.  But usually the amount of entries I get per day or week are not too bad and I can quickly update the contests every few days or so, and that's fine, and enough people were having fun with it that I didn't really have a reason to shut it down.
<p>
About a year ago, a poet who signs his name Stuart Reed discovered the contest and submitted a bunch of entries.  A lot.  This will happen periodically - someone will discover the contest, submit a bunch of stuff, and then either settle down and submit a couple here and there or lose interest.  But Mr. Reed continued to submit on the order of 20 haikus a day, doubling the amount of entries I got.  This became a problem real quick.
<p>
I had never put a limit on entries before because no one had ever flooded me with entries like this, but after a time I decided to call a limit of ten entries per day.  Mr. Reed has chosen to ignore this and still to this day continuously over a hundred haikus a week.  I post the first ten and throw away the rest.  Since Mr. Reed has not changed his submitting pattern and has also never complained that I have NOT posted entries of his, I have the feeling that he doesn't actually read the contest once the entries are posted, he just likes to post.
<p>
Haikus are delicate little things and I think that in order to be good and self-contained little gems, one must spend time on them.  It is fairly easy to spew out a mess of 17-syllable poems and call them haikus, but not good ones.  Mr. Reed's haikus have not struck me as being gems, they've struck me as being as sloppy as you would expect if you whip up 30 or so in a batch, so I don't really even bother to read the 10 I post.
<p>
If you're wondering why I haven't taken this to e-mail with Mr. Reed, I don't have his e-mail address.  He's never submitted it.  I've tried to gently communicate with him via headers in the contest, which has had no effect.
<p>
Now, it would be very easy for me to simply ignore his contest entries.  I can easily set my mail reader to filter out entries from Stuart Reed.  The question is, "Should I?"  Frankly, if he's not reading the entries in the contest once he's posted them, the only reason to post them is for everyone else's enjoyment, and I don't know if that's enough of a reason.  Do you people enjoy his poems enough so I should keep dealing with them?  Remember that posting his stuff adds significantly to my workload.  
<p>
If I filter out his stuff and don't post it, I see one of several things happening: 
<ul>
<li>He continues on as he has, but my mail reader deletes his entries and I don't know or care.
<li>He wakes up and realizes his entries aren't posted, and complains to me, so I can then lay down the law to him.
<li>He resubmits under a different name or names so my filter doesn't catch the entries.  Well, at least that would show he's noticing what's going on.  And I think I'd be able to figure that one out PDQ.
<li>And if the whole thing becomes more of a pain in the ass than it already is, I'll close down the contest.  This is in fact a hobby for me, y'know?  Why do it if it's a pain?
</ul>
