We have now acquired the domain name <a href=http://www.toastpoint.com>toastpoint.com</a>!  
(Gee, Eric, it only took you three years to get off your butt and register the name.)  You should be able to 
get to the haiku contest just by typing <i>toastpoint/haiku</i> in your browser address field.<hr>
<b>Thanks!</b> to all who have <i>clicked the button</I> (see bottom of page).  This past month, 
the click credits not only wiped out my bill, but <i>made</i> me money!  All right, just a couple 
of bucks, but still...  I love the idea of this web page being financially independent - keep it up!

<p><i>Toast Point thinks that living by the sea sounds delightful, though chilly.</i>

<i>The poet comments, "Tom Pappas was a good friend to everyone he met. When I went to see him
in the hospital on February 28 three days before he died, Tom said that
I "might place a wager" on a certain trainer's racehorse. When the
horse won, I called Tom and said that I was holding the winning
uncashed ticket for him. Tom said that he could not cash the
ticket so I will have to keep it until I see Tom again.

Cherry blossoms fall to ground<br>
Winter in spring...

Riding his bike home<br>
in the unexpected snow...<br>
numb fingers and toes
<p>Huddled in a tree<br>
recently returned robins<br>
curse the cold spring snow

The fisherman naps<br>
Quiet heron fills belly<br>
Not many fish left
<p>Too much wasted time<br>
Afraid to say what we feel<br>
Pain outweighs the truth

Staring into forever<br>
I feel the Earth turn

Daily modernism<br>
Painted by old masters is<br>
The classic evening.

An old crow soars wearily<br>
switching on the stars.

..Echoes of Big Bang,<br>
its last reverberations,<br>
its glowing embers...
