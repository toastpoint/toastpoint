Saikaku's haiku.
<br>A compulsion to expire
<br>in selfish excess.
<p><i>The poet comments, "Dedicated to Un-a-basho: Bad art, like bad food
and bad weather, adds nothing to the quality of experience. Art should
be judged by its merit, not its quantity. If art is to stand on its own
then it must have some substance. We are only free to try and make that
happen. "</i></center>
