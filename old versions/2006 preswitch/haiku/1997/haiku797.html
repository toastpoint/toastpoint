<h3>Michael Pollick writes 07/31/97</h3>
Darkness, and what stays<br>
Falls too close to the heart- Poor<br>
enough for beggars.
<p>Entering wisdom<br>
is the first sign of passion,<br>
and love's last gamble.
<p>Gandy dancers sing,<br>
and iron is forced to obey<br>
their undying song.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I have only recently discovered the absolute pleasure of haiku form.  Free verse is interesting in its own way, but
the discipline required to form quality haiku is remarkable.  I hope to learn more about the different forms in the coming
years."</i>

is to forget them

You do not understand them<br>
they like it that way.
