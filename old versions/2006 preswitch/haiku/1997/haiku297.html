Passionate spring frogs.<br>
A breeze, with the promised rain.<br>
Start counting again.

<i>The poet comments, "Spring Tricycle."</i>
<p>
Four hours of sitting.<br>
No one to wield the Big Stick<br>
Counting softly still.
<p>
No Roshi, no goals.<br>
My ass is numb; i'm quitting!<br>
Polish what mirror?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Thanks for listening, Sagebrush."</i>

<i>The poet comments, "I was wondering if you have thought about expanding the rules to include
haiku poetry outside the restrictive 5-7-5 syllable count. I've written around
125 haiku poems in the last 7 years. Only a handful of these fit the classical
5-7-5 format and these were early pieces where I didn't know better. After 
reading "The Haiku Anthology" (edited by Cor Van Den Heuvel) I was introduced
to different forms of Haiku: 1 liners, 2 liners, 3 liners with no syllable
count, vertical 1 liners, ect. Most of the major American Haiku poets write
write in this more freer western form."</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage responds, "The Toast Point Haiku Contest has seen a lot of discussion 
on this issue over the past two years.  It seems to work best for the contest 
if we aim for, but do not insist upon, 5-7-5."</i>
