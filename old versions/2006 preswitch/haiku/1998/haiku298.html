<i>Our fourth together<br>
My adorable Wumpus<br>
Still my valentine!
</center></i>
<hr>
A reader named Haijin sent this to Toast Point:<p>
<i>When I taught oriental poetry I used the following to separate haiku
from senryu:<p>

Haiku is about Nature wherein Man is a part - Senryu is about Man (often

benevolently humorous) wherein Nature is a part.</i>
<p>
We are edified, and thank Haijin for the interest!

September morning-<br>
the sound of rain and traffic<br>
beyond the curtains.

The rain comes from above<br>
No cover found from fallen leaves<br>
Now we cover them
<p>The dead berries hang<br>
Fruits from the late summer's past<br>
Still linger like death
<p>People come and go<br>
They do not see me watching<br>
I think of their lives
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "So much work to do, yet I stare blindly out the window at the rain and the people going about their lives, and I am lost..."</i>
