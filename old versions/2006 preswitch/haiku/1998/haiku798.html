<h3>Stuart Reed writes 07/31/98</h3>
<h4>Jules Verne Qualifies</h4>
A classic English<br>
Eccentric should have many<br>
Diverse qualities.
<p>
The jugular is<br>
Unfathomabilty.<br>
Jules Verne qualifies.
<p>
<h4>Slivers of Saliva Plots</h4>
Sixty thousand leagues<br>
Under the sea and the crew<br>
Are gentlemanly.
<p>Where did men get this<br>
Gentrification complex?<br>
Brains fought brawn and won.
<p>Tall tale tellers tell<br>
Skyscraper high tales. They scratch<br>
The sky and find plots.
<p>Plots on which to base<br>
Towers of Babel. Slivers<br>
Of saliva plots.
<p>
<h4>Sandcastles Don't Last</h4>
Welcome to wisdom.<br>
Wisdom's an unmapped kingdom.<br>
Trodden by the few.
<p>Get your badges here.<br>
We sell T-shirts. She sells sea<br>
Shells by the sea shore.
<p>Building on a flaw<br>
Is not a good idea.<br>
Sandcastles don't last.
<p>

Blistering sunlight<br>
Searing the flesh from my bones.<br>
Summer rays of heat...

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 07/30/98</h3>
<h4>They Didn't Know It Was Haiku</h4>
Socialites party.<br>
Society's leading lights<br>
Get down and dirty.
<p>
Smoky bars only<br>
Use neon on their facades.<br>
Within all is dim.
<p>Squat shot glasses are<br>
Accompanied by chasers<br>
Of imperial pints.
<p>They can both bend minds,<br>
Curve mentality, open<br>
Doors, unlock secrets.
<p>Free spirits that were<br>
Dead and buried in coffins<br>
Of grey, heavy lead.
<p>I've only ever<br>
Written one letter to an<br>
Editor. Honest.
<p>It said "Why do we<br>
Bury our dead in coffins<br>
Of grey, heavy lead?"
<p>Honest. To the Times.<br>
It meant a lot to me at<br>
The time. God knows why.
<p>They didn't print it,<br>
Needless to say. They didn't <br>
Know it was haiku.
<p>

<h3>Jerry Ball writes 07/30/98</h3>
by the open door<br>
two women in long dresses<br>
sipping iced coffee
<p>the day grows warmer<br>
he wants to explain again<br>
why he failed the test
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Happy to see emphasis on 5-7-5.
"</i>
<p>
<h3>Joe Gill writes 07/30/98</h3>
Wet, love-quenched, head full<br>
Vortex of sorrowful souls <br>
Ambivalent mass
<p>
Distance between us<br>
I fall through another day <br>
I land where you were
<p>Waves shake up the sky<br>
Evil backs the world around <br>
The godly hunt souls
<p>Waves shake-up the sky<br>
Evil backs the world around <br>
The godly hunt souls
<p>Placid pool shivers<br>
The chill from a skipping stone<br>
Dead leaves come to life

<h4>Reflections of a Moribund Opera Singer</h4>
Caruso, Melba...<br>
Life's tragedies...better sung<br>
Unspoken heart's words.
<p>
If I had a gun,<br>
I'd travel and shoot out a<br>
Bunch of juke boxes.
<p>If I had a bunch <br>
Of jukeboxes there would be<br>
Only opera.
<p>Opera in all...<br>
Seasons take their time, their toll<br>
Upon the actors.
<p>Never made it to <br>
The Met nor La Scala...'twas<br>
Just songs in my head.
<p>Unswept floor, cut sets...<br>
Costumed mannequins behind<br>
The last drawn curtain.
<p>

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 07/29/98</h3>
<h4>Birdsong at Its Best</h4>
This melodrama<br>
Is anything but mellow.<br>
It's a bull's bellow.
<p>The enormity.<br>
Culture of conformity.<br>
Inertial success.
<p>Sand dunes undulate.<br>
Ululations oscillate.<br>
Nomad's an island.
<p>Life in the desert<br>
Is disorientated.<br>
It doesn't belong.
<p>Shake a sheikh. Watch his<br>
Harem go weak at the knees.<br>
Tunisian knees.
<p>Thunder and lightning.<br>
Is the storm building or is<br>
The sky collapsing?
<p>You can't help but love<br>
A Night in Tunisia.<br>
Birdsong at its best.
<p>
<h4>Can't Cancel Cancer</h4>
Testicular pain.<br>
Politely referred to as<br>
A groin injury.
<p>Masses of money<br>
And scientific effort<br>
Can't cancel cancer.
<p>
The search for lumps goes<br>
On apace. Malignancy.<br>
Are you there? Hello?
<p>

After the rain storm<br>
Two ants on the grass blade<br>
Waiting for the sun

<h3><a href=mailto:KAZ1K@aol.com>Raceway</a> writes 07/28/98</h3>
Along muddied lanes<br>
Shivering in purple hoods....<br>
Violets in rain.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Troubled, sleepless shore<br>
Exhales at night her warm breath<br>
Of pine and jasmine.
<p>A small, winged echo.....<br>
Your yesterday's face bending<br>
To the fragrant rose.
<p>Autumn's colors burst<br>
On a canvas of blue light....<br>
Pheasants ascending.
<p>I stare and I stare....<br>
Implacable the presence<br>
Of his empty bed.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
If, as clerics say,<br>
God made us in his image,<br>
We reciprocate.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "After Voltaire, "Le Sottisier".....
"</i>
<p>From nothing God made<br>
Everything, but the nothing<br>
Will always show through.

<h3><a href=mailto:cosmonaut_321@hotmail>Jonah H. Wolff</a> writes 07/28/98</h3>
<h4>Reflections of Hilde</h4>
Namhle, kusasa,                     <i> (Today, tomorrow,)<br></i>
Izoso ekusini                        <i> (barbeque in the morning)</i><br>
No ngilambile.                       <i> (And I have hunger)</i>
<p>
Heute, morgen...und                 <i> (Today, tomorrow)</i><br>
Grillen frueh morgens und noch  <i>(barbeque in the mornings)</i><br>
Habe ich Hunger                    <i>     (And still I hunger)</i>.
<p>These are the words that<br>
Hilde spoke in Zulu and<br>
German...her heart pained.
<p>She left with my set<br>
of collectors' pens, stamps<br>
and promises to write.
<p>She said she wanted<br>
To leave because she owed the<br>
World a tragedy.
<p>Hamburg and Luebeck...<br>
Stops to see family and<br>
Eat sweet marzipan.
<p>Tschuess Mutti, Pappa          <i>   (Goodbye Mom and Dad)</i><br>
Flieg', bis Sued Afrika              <i>(Will fly till South Africa)</i><br>
Werd' Euch mal schreiben.     <i>  (Will write you sometime)</i>.
<p>The perspiration<br>
On Hilde's brow is endless,<br>
Flows like hot rivers.
<p>Home is where the heart<br>
Grows new roots, new branches like<br>
The weeping willows.
<p>Calloused feet stamp dirt.<br>
Flattened by generations.<br>
The kraal's dance begins.
<p>
<h3><a href=mailto:cosmonaut_321@hotmail.com>Jonah H. Wolff</a> writes 07/27/98</h3>
We are cosmonauts<br>
All training our entire lives.<br>
Awaiting the call.
<p>
All the great minds will<br>
Die as terrorists or by<br>
Actions unto them.
<p>Watching the city<br>
Go by can't be fun when you're<br>
An urban peasant.
<p>Rusting spoon has seen<br>
The rain, the sun...now sees hoar<br>
Frost grow in splinters.
<p>The bird does not trust<br>
The new birdbath and flies<br>
Back to the old pond.

Chicken noodle soup<br>
Is great for the spirit but<br>
Not for the chicken.

<h4>At a Vancouver Beach on July 25/98</h4>
Drummers watch the sea,<br>
Memorize syncopation,<br>
Mimic crazed heartbeats.
<p>
Sand flea falls into lake.<br>
Tiny sandpit of water.<br>
Lake dries...flea is dead.
<p>Blind naked woman<br>
Holds another's arm...telling<br>
Her what men are like.
<p>She smells the ocean.<br>
Her friend helps her count the waves.<br>
Pounding surf hides cries.
<p>Cocoanut winds blow<br>
throughout this tropical land.<br>
People bake on the sand.
<p>Vendors cry out to<br>
Burned victims of vanity...<br>
Ice cold beers! Caesars!
<p>One vendor speaks to<br>
the sun.   "I need money...I<br>
Am as poor as sand."
<p>I'm buying a bus<br>
Ticket to Toronto when<br>
My luck runs out here.

<h4>Sage Rhymes with Age</h4>
Artistic intent<br>
Is all very well. Will it<br>
Help to pay the rent?
<p>
In one ear and out<br>
The other. What we hear is<br>
Different drummers.
<p>Is your dialogue<br>
Logical or will someone<br>
Lodge a fierce complaint?
<p>Is it any real <br>
Wonder that aged people<br>
End up like children?
<p>They've been through a loop.<br>
Innocence, knowledge and then<br>
Innocence again.
<p>The more you know the<br>
More you know how little you<br>
Actually know.
<p>So is it any <br>
Wonder that the English word<br>
For sage rhymes with age?
<p>

Do you sometimes get<br>
The feeling? The further you<br>
Go, the less you know?
<p>
Poetry is one<br>
Sure fire way to make all your<br>
Privacy public.

sleepless night of pain<br>
a lonesome dove at sunrise<br>

a lullaby and goodnight<br>

Seeking to be you<br>

Your successful key.

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 07/24,25/98</h3>
<h4>Fences and Anxiety</h4>
Your anxiety<br>
Lacks both sobriety and<br>
Viability.
<p>We put fences round<br>
Our fears for fear of losing<br>
That which we hold dear.
<p>
<h4>The Failure of Males</h4>
Low growling exhaust<br>
Passing a V8 message<br>
To men on sidewalks.
<p>Masculinity.<br>
Holy trinity. Muscles,<br>
Genitals and pride.
<p>It takes a village<br>
Raped, plundered, pillaged, to see<br>
The failure of males.
<p>
<h4>Feed Them to My Snake</h4>
The opposite sex<br>
Is placed in the position<br>
Of opposition.
<p>Repent at leisure.<br>
Take your own sweet time. Oodles<br>
Of leisurely time.
<p>Don Juan climbs ladders<br>
In order to meet the snake<br>
Who speaks with forked tongue.
<p>Now, were I Adam<br>
I would say to Eve, "Sorry,<br>
Sweetheart, don't you grieve,
<p>Got to be on my<br>
Solitary way. Never<br>
Did like apples much.
<p>Gonna buy me a<br>
Merc'ry and cruise up and down<br>
Looking for females.
<p>Gonna rumble my<br>
V8 exhaust in their ears.<br>
Feed them to my snake.
<p>
<h4>Time Has Got Big Balls</h4>
The first thing I fell<br>
In love with on TV was<br>
Tom and Jerry. Yo.
<p>
Were there world enough -<br>
Were there but world enough, that<br>
Is to say - and time
<p>I'd tell you about<br>
Tom and Jerry. But there ain't <br>
World enough and time.
<p>Then again. They say<br>
Time is a continuum<br>
And so never ends.
<p>Like a rubber band.<br>
Keeps on bouncing back again.<br>
Time's resilient.
<p>Keeps on flouncing back<br>
Again, dressed in different<br>
Guises. Time is wise.
<p>Keeps on echoing<br>
Back and forth off canyon walls.<br>
Time has got big balls.
<p>
<h4>Interlude</h4>
Chinese governments<br>
Will slowly learn the art of<br>
Global governance.
<p>The questioner's voice<br>
Is querulous because the<br>
Answer's perilous.
<p>Look the other way<br>
While the missus and I have<br>
A roll in the hay.
<p>Behind the scenes they're<br>
Pulling strings, marking time till<br>
The fat lady sings.
<p>It's hard to be light<br>
And easy to be heavy.<br>
Ready, steady, go.
<p>
<h4>How Right You Are, Squire</h4>
Tom and Jerry. Yo.<br>
Fred Quimby and Co. Don't it<br>
Always seem to go.
<p>Disappearing acts.<br>
I can't check my facts but my<br>
Guess would be that they
<p>Made Tom and Jerry<br>
At the same time that Charlie<br>
Parker's alto sax
<p>Was blowing the world<br>
Apart. Fifties. Late fifties.<br>
Half of this hundred.
<p>Fred Quimby and Charles<br>
Christopher Parker, Jr.,<br>
A.k.a. Yardbird.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Jr. pronounced June Yer."</i>
<p>America has<br>
Much to be proud of. Heroes<br>
Galore. By the score.
<p>I have a bio<br>
Of Charlie Parker. It says<br>
1934
<p>Joined marijuana<br>
Ring. Marijuana ring. What<br>
Is that, for fuck's sake?
<p>Marijuana ring.<br>
Goodness gracious. They had rings<br>
Of marijuana.
<p>Who'da thunka such<br>
A thing? Alto sax in a<br>
Marijuana ring.
<p>Now press fast forward<br>
Several decades. I am<br>
Standing in a bar.
<p>A whippersnapper<br>
Of a lad is telling me<br>
About Fred Quimby.
<p>He calls Fred Quimby<br>
Walt Disney, but then he would,<br>
Wouldn't he? He says
<p>"Walt Disney locked<br>
His writers up in a house<br>
And supplied them with
<p>Unlimited dope.<br>
Antebellum dope. And said<br>
'Don't come out of there
<p>Till you've got a toon.'"
I look at the young<br>
Whippersnapper and think<br>
'How right you are, squire.'
<p>
<h4>Got No Reply</h4>
So what gives? Wassup?<br>
'Sup, bro? Kitty got your tongue?<br>
Don't know what to say?
<p>Have your feelngs been<br>
Blunted on reality?<br>
Now press fast forward.
<p>Several decades<br>
Later I have heard of a<br>
Group called the Fugees.
<p>I have heard they sing<br>
A good song. So I wander<br>
Round the record store
<p>Till I find the rap.<br>
Rattety tat tat. Till I<br>
Find the rapping rack.
<p>And there, lurking with<br>
Intent, is a compact disc<br>
Of stunning lightness.
<p>Knock me down with a<br>
Feather, Trevor. The Fugees.<br>
Or the Refugees.
<p>The refugees from<br>
Everywhere, or so it seems.<br>
Nineties' refugees.
<p>Fifties in Paris.<br>
The Refugees sing "Blunted<br>
On Reality."
<p>This light compact disc<br>
Came packed in paper that said<br>
"Do you want to join
<p>The Fugees Fan Club?"<br>
I did. This was the first time<br>
Ever, but I did.
<p>So I filled out the<br>
Application form. Sent it<br>
Off. Got no reply. 
<p>I'll find me a context<br>
Broad and wide and beneath its<br>
Sheets I'll sleepily slide.<br>
<i>The poet comments, "(Thought I'd Slip That One In)"</i>
<p>
<h4>Zoot Suit</h4>
"Boy are you corny.<br>
You're a square at the fair, a<br>
Goon from Saskatoon.
<p>You come on like a<br>
Broken arm. You are one sad<br>
Apple, a longhair.
<p>A cornhusker. In<br>
Other words you don't send me.<br>
So bail out, brother.
<p>Get lost. And here's your<br>
Rat, cat." Dialogue from a<br>
Cartoon called Zoot Suit.
<p>
<h4>Breathtaking Names for Floors</h4>
If you don't take the<br>
Lift but the stairs, you come to<br>
The mezzanine floor.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, ""Lift" is escalator in English English."</i>
<p>Now why should a floor<br>
That doesn't exist have such<br>
A breathtaking name?
<p>
<h4>Answers on Postcards Only</h4>
Send you answers on<br>
A postcard to the below<br>
Specified address.
<p>
<h4>Oh, Jackson</h4>
So Tom dresses cute,<br>
Puts on a zoot suit. Hot stuff.<br>
He's a real cool cat.
<p>Looks a million bucks.<br>
"Aw, shucks, ma'am. It's just a<br>
Tux. Sniff my bouquet
<p>Like you'd sniff a wine.<br>
Appreciate the ageing<br>
Process. That's progress."
<p>What the cat seeks is<br>
Hegemony, harmony,<br>
Unification.
<p>He dons a zoot suit.<br>
Made from a hammock canvas.<br>
"Oh, Jackson," she squeals.
<p>
<h4>Why Does Tom Don A Zoot Suit?</h4>
"Boy, are you corny.<br>
How many times have you been<br>
Told that? How many
<p>
Girls have said 'Sorry,<br>
Horace, I can only be<br>
A sister to you'?
<p>Get hep to the jive.<br>
Get your boots laced, buddy. Step<br>
In. See Smiling Sam,
<p>The zoot suit man. Step<br>
Out with a zoot suit with a<br>
Drape shape and reet pleat.
<p>Wear an ankle length<br>
Jacket with three foot shoulders,<br>
Pants that begin at
<p>The chin, zoom to a<br>
54 inch knee and then<br>
Fa-a-ade softly to a
<p>Three inch victory<br>
Cuff. Get hep. Get one. Get lost<br>
In a new zoot suit."
<p>
<h4>They Led to Shiva</h4>
This was the ad that<br>
Tom heard. The radio ad.<br>
With music to match.
<p>I don't know how to<br>
Define this music. Nineteen<br>
Fifties cartoon tunes.
<p>It's magnificent.<br>
It's fast and spot on. Maybe<br>
It's called jitterbug.
<p>But let's not forget,<br>
Folks, Tom and Jerry were white,<br>
Folks. And for white folk.
<p>So I am forced to<br>
The conclusion that the men<br>
Behind it were black.
<p>Because who ever<br>
Heard of white folk talking like<br>
That? Even in ads?
<p>And who ever heard<br>
White folk playing jitterbug<br>
Like that? "Oh, Jackson."
<p>Personally, I<br>
Never got to wear a zoot<br>
Suit. This may be moot.
<p>The closest I've come<br>
Were some dancing boots I had.<br>
High-heeled leather boots.
<p>I loved to dance in<br>
Those high-heeled dancing leather<br>
Boots. Pedal zoot suits.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, ""Pedal" pronounced peedal."</i>
<p>In all innocence<br>
I bought these boots not knowing<br>
They'd lead to Shiva.
<p>
<h4>Haiku Written Whilst Milking Cows</h4>
Now I go to milk <br>
The cows. Cows are very now<br>
Creatures. How now cow?
<p>Consider yourself<br>
Lucky to be alive. Do<br>
The crazy hand jive.
<p>Popular spots are<br>
Populated heavily<br>
Sometimes. It depends.
<p>Popular spots may<br>
Drop in popularity.<br>
It depends on trends.
<p>Who intrudes on whom?<br>
Who is zooming whom? Was that<br>
Aretha Franklin?
<p>I drink Goldstar beer.<br>
Yesterday I bought a new<br>
VCR. Goldstar.
<p>Goldstar is the name<br>
Of the VCR. GoldStar<br>
To be more precise.
<p>There is a point of<br>
Some anthropological<br>
Interest in this.
<p>This is not only<br>
A new VCR. This is<br>
My first VCR.
<p>I have never owned<br>
A VCR in my life<br>
Until late last night.
<p>And the first cassette<br>
I put in this VCR?<br>
Yes. Tom and Jerry.
<p>Guests from Canada<br>
Suddenly appear, wearing<br>
Strong deodorant.
<p>I know this, but these<br>
Sudden guests from Canada<br>
Have no idea.
<p>They don't know that I<br>
Think they stink more than cows do,<br>
Even though it's true.
<p>I think they think they're<br>
Doing me a favour. They<br>
Don't know that they stink.
<p>The cows and I do,<br>
Though. Both the cows and I are<br>
Very now creatures.
<p>
<h4>Ain't This Suit Just Too Zoot?</h4>
Wait a minute. Walt<br>
Disney and unlimited dope.<br>
Black reefer junkies.
<p>Something here does not<br>
Gel. Let's listen to Tom and<br>
Jerry for a spell.
<p>"Jackson!" "What's jumping<br>
Chick?" "You're a sharp character.<br>
A meller feller.
<p>Now you're carving my<br>
Jive. You're on the right side, ya<br>
Alligator you.
<p>Slip me some skin my<br>
Friend." "Well all reet. Well all root.<br>
Well all right." "Let's take
<p>A little righteous<br>
Jive. Do ya hear me? Latch on<br>
Jackson." Then they dance.
<p>That is to say they<br>
Jitterbug, snug as bugs in<br>
Oriental rugs.
<p>Tom and his missus<br>
Do the jitterbug. And look,<br>
I must say, quite smug.
<p>Tom then slips on a<br>
Banana skin. And ends up<br>
At the piano.
<p>There he sings "I love<br>
You. When I'm with you I'm what<br>
You call a hip cat.
<p>I am hip to the <br>

Invented by Sax.
<p>Playing bee-bop in<br>
Paris in the late nineteen<br>
Fifties. Nifty. No?
<p>Woman not taking<br>
No for either a question<br>
Or an answer. Bro.
<p>Kneeling before the<br>
Plunger, poised to blow up<br>
No. A massive no.
<p>What were they selling?<br>
Could it be jeans? She was quite<br>
Tightly clad in jeans.
<p>But I've abandonned<br>
Her for greener pastures of<br>
Late. I have said no.
<p>She, however, waits,<br>
Kneeling before her plunger,<br>
Charged with dynamite.
<p>Extremely free style<br>
Allusions. Recreations<br>
Of some illusions.
<p>Haiku, for instance.<br>
Creative recreation.<br>
Free from most fetters.
<p>Snafu, for instance.<br>
Snafu means situation<br>
Normal. A fuck-up.
<p>Silverstone race track.<br>
Birkdale golf course. The Masters.<br>
Played in Atlanta.
<p>Up pops the jack in <br>

Same thing. The Neville Brothers<br>

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 07/17/98</h3>
<h4>Haiku Written Whilst Milking Cows</h4>
There are numerous<br>
Ruling regulations in<br>
The ruling classes.
<p>
Ermine. Diadems.<br>
Badges of office. Social<br>
Status. Bought by cash. 
<p>I start milking cows<br>
By watering plants. The plants<br>
Are grateful. Say thanks.
<p>
The milking rhythm<br>
Is how you coordinate<br>
Milking time's passing.
<p>
This means dancing to<br>
The radio and writing<br>
Japanese haiku.
<p>And listening to<br>
A friend discussing beer whilst<br>
Eating stolen grapes.
<p>So you are bound to<br>
Ask yourselves if seventeen<br>
Syllables do fit.
<p>
<h4>Epilogue</h4>
Do not take no for<br>
An answer. Blow no up. Blow<br>
No to smithereens.
<p>I have a poster<br>
Of a lady doing just<br>
That. Blowing up no.
<p>What were they selling?<br>
It was a poster designed<br>
To sell something. What?
<p>She was clad in tight<br>
Jeans and was kneeling in front<br>
Of a big plunger.
<p>She was blowing up<br>
An idealisation<br>
Of a massive no.
<p>The caption beneath<br>
Read "Woman not taking no<br>
For an answer." Yes.
<p>My co-worker may<br>
Be crabby because it may<br>
Be his queen's birthday.
<p>The alarm shrieks with<br>
Banshee insistence. The milk,<br>
It seems, has got hot.
<p>Global warming will<br>
Make milk's preservation that<br>
Much harder than now.
<p>But we won't take no<br>
For an answer. We will kneel<br>
Before the plunger.
<p>If he doesn't have<br>
The right-coloured skin how can<br>
He have the right kin?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Could you give the last haiku the title of "Epilogue." These were written between 6:15 and 8:30, Friday, July 17."</i>
<p>We do our bit for<br>
Queen and country. We might, in<br>
Fact, revel in it.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a little more free-style, tentatively called "Josephine.""</i>
<p>"Dear John" was all she <br>
Wrote. "Dear John. I've met a most<br>
Unusual man.
<p>One who doesn't smell<br>
Of bodily functions. He's<br>
Covered in unguents."
<p>Bet your life. That man's<br>
Beard is always neater trimmed,<br>
His eyes, cooler blue. 
<p>Bet your life. Bet your<br>
Dreams of virility when<br>
Meeting a woman.
<p>Do your hands shake when<br>
You share a handshake with a<br>
Goddess? Do you break?
<p>Do you take stock with<br>
A sinking heart? Do you tot<br>
Your total failures?
<p>Do you see yourself<br>
As having only one good<br>
Arm, Napoleon?
<p>There's a broad expanse<br>
Of military medals<br>
Adorning your chest.
<p>Perhaps she equates<br>
Medals with bravery or<br>
Male virility.
<p>Perhaps her star has<br>
Become linked with yours through the<br>
Intervening wars.
<p>Josephine has been<br>
A kind of chauvinist butt.<br>
Not tonight. Tut tut.
<p>Josephine was queen<br>
So she probably didn't<br>
Care about her butt.
<p>Napoleon was<br>
A one-armed bandit. He was<br>
France's Las Vegas.
<p>Everybody shrugs<br>
When talk turns to the topic<br>
Of drugs. Bigwigs shrug.
<p>We are fighting a<br>
War that rather like Russia<br>
Doesn't quite exist.
<p>Guns, for instance, are <br>
Neither here nor there. Agents<br>
Fight drugs with thin air.
<p>Propaganda films.<br>
Take a gander. You will gag.<br>
Reefer junkies. Sad.
<p>People flying out<br>
Of windows, taking deadly<br>
Aerobatic trips.
<p>The greatest danger<br>
In LSD was you might<br>
Think you're Icarus.
<p>Birds of a feather<br>
Wax enthusiastic when<br>
Talking of weather. 
<p>How now brown milch cow?<br>
The quick brown fox jumps over<br>
The man in the moon.
<p>Josephine, concerned<br>
About the arrangement of<br>
Her polka-dot dress,
<p>Adjusted her bra,<br>
In the hope of presenting<br>
Symmetrical breasts.
<p>Napoleon's chest,<br>
Swelled by medals or weighed down<br>
By medals, perhaps.
<p>Was the object of<br>
Our Josephine's affections.<br>
His chest held her heart.
<p>Josephine was smart.<br>
Of that there can be no doubt.<br>
But she's still a butt.

<h4>Haiku on the Eyes of your Children</h4>
Just think. Not even<br>
One human being knows what<br>
Goes on in the brain.
<p> 
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Our private selves are<br>
Persona non grata. Hence<br>
Public personae.
<p>
Haphazard hazards,<br>
No respecters of persons,<br>
Are strewn on all paths.
<p>
Put pixels on screens<br>
And make moving pictures. They<br>
Will believe it's true.
<p>
They will lap it up.<br>
Like dewlaps on cows lap dew.<br>
Purring cats on laps.
<p>
Kamikaze Japs.<br>
Dying for a cause. Dying<br>
To find a just cause.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Dying to be told<br>
That their death was not in vain,<br>
Though dead ears are deaf.
<p>Minds' eyes see mirrors.<br>
Mirrors are blind, though they are<br>
Dependent on sight.
<p>
Minds' eyes, however,<br>
Are not dependent on sight.<br>
Blinder than mirrors.
<p>These same minds' eyes see<br>
Glory in death. These eyes are<br>
Manifestly mad.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There's glory galore<br>
In life. There's precious little<br>
More than gore in death.
<p>But the mind sees God.<br>
To be precise, God lives in<br>
Reptilian brains.
<p>Our brains are triune.<br>
Triune brains have three layers,<br>
One atop t'other.
<p>First, neocortex.<br>
Second, limbic system and <br>
Third, reptilian.
<p>Reptilian brain,<br>
A.k.a. reptilian<br>
Complex. Yup. Complex.
<p>Complexity is<br>
The major underlying<br>
Feature of our brains.
<p>No man can deny.<br>
For every answer there's an<br>
Incubating why.
<p>Why reptilian?
<p>
Because, my brothers,<br>
We got them from the lizards.<br>
Our reptile cousins.
<p>Survival of the <br>
Fittest involves remnants of<br>
The weakest. Their ghosts.
<p>And if we are the<br>
Fittest and the prettiest,<br>
We've ugly, weak roots.
<p>We've the ghosts of a<br>
Million reptiles lurking<br>
In our basic brain.
<p>Our reptilian<br>
Complex. And God was born in<br>
Reptilian brains.
<p>Round about the time<br>
Of the massive extinction<br>
Of the dinosaurs.
<p>God was born. I swear<br>
To God. Go ahead, ask him.<br>
When were you born, God?
<p>At the time of the <br>
Birth of the triune brain, God<br>
Would reply wisely.
<p>Alternatively,<br>
You could say at the time of<br>
Dinosaurs' dying.
<p>Like kamikaze <br>
Pilots. Going down in a<br>
Blaze of dead glory.
<p>But that's another<br>
Story. What concerns us here<br>
Is reptilians.
<p>To be more precise,<br>
Dinosaurs; massive lizards<br>
Who died for our good.
<p>They saw a massive<br>
Meteor come from the sky.<br>
And then they died off.
<p>They weren't so stupid<br>
As not to connect the two<br>
Events. Sky and death.
<p>After the death of<br>
The dinosaurs, along came<br>
Our other forebears.
<p>To be precise, our<br>
Nonprimate mammalian<br>
Forebears. Oh mamma.
<p>Placental mammals.<br>
Nonprimate mammalian<br>
Forebears. Pseudospeak.
<p>Dolphins and whales are<br>
Cetaceans. They forebore<br>
Our neocortices.
<p>Just think, not even <br>
One human being knows what<br>
Goes on in the brain.
<p>Our most dominant<br>
Feature and also the one<br>
That's least understood.
<p>Hands up. Who among<br>
You knew that we had triune<br>
Brains? Precious few, huh?
<p>And yet we trust our<br>
Brains because they mirror life.<br>
And can't mirror death.
<p>Death of dinosaurs,<br>
For instance. We trust our brains<br>
Not to lead us there.
<p>But our brains are there.<br>
At every brain's core there is<br>
A reptile complex.
<p>Or R-complex, as<br>
Scientific literature<br>
Abbreviates it.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Should you be lucky<br>
And find a good audience,<br>
Treat them with respect.
<p>Talk to them about<br>
Brain functions. After all, what<br>
Are humans but brains?
<p>Brains on stilts. Upright<br>
Primates. Upright and uptight.<br>
Vivacious, nervous.
<p>Our neocortex<br>
Is a mass of nerves. Not to<br>
Mention synapses.
<p>The poet comments<br>
"For Elaine." Switching boxes.<br>
Routing connections.
<p>A pinball machine.<br>
Try not ot tilt. Don't push it<br>
Beyond its limits.
<p>Our neocortex<br>
Lights up  like a fairground at<br>
The mention of nerves.
<p>It has so many <br>
Nerves that it is bound to be<br>
Nervous when mentioned.
<p>The R-complex, on<br>
The other hand, is reserved.<br>
Shy and lacking verve.
<p>Our brain says "I am<br>
Important." Our body has<br>
No choice. It agrees.
<p>Even though it is our<br>
Eyes that see we agree that<br>
Only minds' eyes see.
<p>Our neocortex<br>
Resolutely denies that<br>
There's an R-complex.
<p>And R-complexes<br>
Are incapable of speech.<br>
Let's not forget that.
<p>Gods, also, oddly<br>
Enough are incapable<br>
Of coherent speech.
<p>Do you know to what<br>
Extent your brain is concerned<br>
With moving your tongue?
<p>If you did it would<br>
Give you pause. You'd look for the<br>
Underlying cause.
<p>You'd say speech must be<br>
Essential, then you'd worry<br>
About being dumb.
<p>Deck the halls with sprigs<br>
Of holly would be hollow<br>
Without the music.
<p>We don't seem to have<br>
A mental allegiance to<br>
Our external ears.
<p>So the chain breaks down<br>
At sight. What we saw was a<br>
Meteor. At night.
<p>It crashed into the<br>
Planet earth and set off<br>
A chain reaction.
<p>Human beings grew<br>
To be servants of God when<br>
The dinosaurs died.
<p>You don't believe it?<br>
Look at the wonder in the<br>
Eyes of your children.

<h4>Haiku on Toothache and Being a Scribe</h4>
Toothache wrecking ball.<br>
Mental edifices fall<br>
To the writer's gall.
<p>
Egyptian scribes fell<br>
In love with the motion of<br>
Nibs on papyrus.
<p>
Occasionally<br>
It occurs to me. I'm an<br>
Under-achiever.
<p>Blessed be all this<br>
Nomenclature. It is a<br>
Part of our culture.
<p>To tread new paths is<br>
To get trodden on. Ask the<br>
Lone downtrodden wolf.
<p>A scribe is supposed<br>
To get effusive about<br>
Curvaceous esses.
<p>Then along came the<br>
Typewriter. Kaboom. No more<br>
Curlicued esses.
<p>Curlicued esses<br>
Have disappeared. Been replaced<br>
By word processors.
<p>The glint of fresh ink<br>
Drying in the sun. The smell<br>
Of sharpened pencils.
<p>The grain of wood on<br>
The desk lid. The initials<br>
Scratched with precision.
<p>The squeak of chalk on<br>
A green blackboard. The bouncing<br>
Pungent eraser.
<p>If all the tools are<br>
In place, the calligrapher<br>
May proceed with grace.
<p>An itinerant<br>
Japanese calligrapher.<br>
Haiku on horseback.
<p>He was extended<br>
An honourable welcome<br>
And at least three meals.
<p>His horse was stabled,<br>
His laundry done. Hot bath.<br>
Clean sheets and Shoguns.
<p>Then on the morrow<br>
He'd write a poem or two<br>
On rice paper rolls.
<p>This bloke's job was to<br>
Encapsulate or capture<br>
Life in a pen-stroke.
<p>If he achieved it,<br>
No wonder he was honoured.<br>
No unsung hero.
<p>If he didn't, who<br>
Cared? No one expected him<br>
To, to tell the truth.
<p>It was tradition,<br>
A ritual. That was all.<br>
Time-honoured pen-strokes.
<p>Lucy in the sky<br>
Watched from the river. Closely<br>
Watched calligrapher.
<p>The gods of rivers<br>
Didn't take kindly to an<br>
Ill-proportioned ess.
<p>So itinerant<br>
Horsemen learned not to press,<br>
To go with the flow.
<p>There is a scroll of<br>
Japanese calligraphy<br>
Hanging on my wall.
<p>It says that God jumps<br>
Over heaven's gate, which is<br>
An odd thing to say.
<p>It's exquisite,<br>
In spite of its mad message.<br>
Or maybe because.
<p>Heaven's Gate. Heaven<br>
Can Wait. Two Hollywood films.<br>
Modern script writers.
<p>Toothache's wrecking ball<br>
Has been stalled by a wall of<br>
Antibiotics.

Going out on a<br>
Limb is suicide to a<br>
Lopsided leper.
<p>Buskers fight sound with<br>
Sound in London's Underground.<br>
Music in the Tube.
<p>The aliens are<br>
Assuming ascension mode.<br>
Back to Mother Lode.

Exquisite fireworks<br>
But even the smoke is gone:<br>
Moon and dark clouds play.

Knit one, purl one and<br>
Twirl one too. A million<br>
Dewdrops form the dew.

Addictive coffee.

Synopses on synapses.<br>
There are so many.
<p>It's lonely at the<br>
Top, crowded at the bottom.<br>
Gotham pyramid.
<p>Skepticism was<br>
Hard to keep though the skeptic<br>
Kept it. Under wraps.
<p>I like a corkscrew<br>
That screws straight and true. All my<br>
Corkscrews screw askew.

Slink between any weak link<br>
Or chink in your chain.

Swirling smoke and floating motes.<br>

<p>That silly germ of<br>
An idea underwent<br>
Extermination.

You've an incomplete verbal<br>
Palette, so to speak.

Rival arrivals<br>

Shouting and shoving.

Is a lingua franca, though, <br>
Of course, unspoken.

The spectators aren't<br>
Particular so long as<br>
It's spectacular.
<p>Here comes plenitude<br>
Threatening and weakening<br>
Moral rectitude.
<p>All the latest rage<br>
Bounding onto centre stage,<br>
Flying from the wings.
<p>I dig dignity.<br>
Indigo indignity<br>
Paints my whole world blue.
<p>You have nothing to<br>
Lose but your workaday blues<br>
In the neon night.

For "Yes ma'am." It drove the good<br>
Miss Daisy crazy.

Gray-golden, brown-green,<br>
what's your blend, chameleon?<br>
Any shade that blends.
<p>transcendental blues<br>
sorrows of Jerusalem<br>
truth of sun and rock
<p>Lonely loony night.<br>
The bitter taste of moonshine<br>
lingers on my tongue.

Light in my face, but...<br>
already the cool of night<br>
Low sun in the pines

Weed killer and rain<br>

Overgrown garden

Maybe gay feather

Seems like a week now

weeds overrun the garden<br>

Fused together like stained glass<br>
Unwanted borders

Blushing the boisterous sun<br>
Hiding behind clouds

A campfire for the the planets<br>
Winter to Winter

Music is the soul<br>
of nature.  Heard in her night<br>
songs and sighs, she cries.

A tear of nature's<br>
joy is left on every<br>
tree's outstretched glory.

<h4>Haiku on Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</h4>
Lucy in the sky,<br>
Tiara perched pertly on<br>
Her pretty blonde pate.
<p>There at the turnstile<br>
Proffering cash in exchange<br>
For a first class ride.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
With porcelain eyes<br>
Porters mesmerise. Lucy's<br>
Not the least surprised.
<p>Tangerine tulips<br>
Touch her two lips. They kiss<br>
And speak double Dutch.
<p>With looking glass ties<br>
You look their shirt in the eye<br>
Whilst combing your chest.
<p>Answers quite slowly<br>
Bounce along neural pathways<br>
Into ear canals.
<p>Marshmallow pies eat<br>
Rocking horse people as did<br>
Chicago's eggplant.
<p>Cellophane flowers,<br>
Transparently light, glint like<br>
Glass in head-high grass.
<p>Newspaper taxis<br>
Give you bare bosomed beauties<br>
On every third page.
<p>Kaleidoscopic<br>
Eye sockets picture themselves<br>
The picture of health.
<p>Sgt. Pepper would<br>
Be most unlikely to have<br>
A lonely hearts club.

<i>The poet comments, "Without further ado I will move on to writing haiku whilst milking cows."</i>
<p>
A length of hose-pipe<br>
And hollow metal pillars<br>
Call cows to milking.
<p>
Be a poet, bro.<br>
Then you'll have mental music<br>
Wherever you go.

Silence of the cows<br>
Is a whole lot calmer than<br>
Silence of the lambs.

Next we come to the<br>
Art of yelling where we find<br>

It ain't hot you do<br>
It's the way hot you do it.<br>
That's what makes what's hot.

Without water we<br>
Would have no milk and without<br>
Worms we'd have no silk.

A herd of cows on<br>
A kibbutz. Marshalled human<br>
And bovine forces.

Hygiene is godly<br>
Because both bacteria<br>
And gods can't be seen.

<i>The poet comments, "I believe in gods, plural, not God, singular."</i>
<p>
A bell rings, a light<br>
Shines, an alarm sounds. These things<br>
Have rational grounds.
