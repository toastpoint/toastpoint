<HR>

Every so often (not often enough) I am inspired (or kicked in the
butt enough) to write something.  These somethings have usually
been essays, and remarkable enough, most of them have been
published - usually in alternative free weekly papers in
Philadelphia.  Some generated letters to the editor, and I'll be
including these eventually.  Most had illustrations, and once I get
a
scanner, I'll include them as well.

<h2>Published Stuff:</h2>
<h3><a href=writing/fancy.html>Fancy Dancing</a></h3>
<p>
An essay about rediscovering a piece of my closeted past.  My
first published piece, and still one of my best.  I was terrified
about letters to the editor, but there were none!  Hmmm...
<hr>

<h3><a href=writing/english.html>The Joy of Being Smug About
English Usage</a></h3>
<p>
My second published piece, first Welcomat piece.  Silly
ramblings, a lot of fun and it generated weeks of letters.
<hr> 

<h3><a href=writing/computer.html>Computers Made Me Smarter -
Insufferable Too!</a></h3>
<p>
Although I make my living in computer support, this is the only
piece I've written about it.  One letter.  When the Welcomat
published its 1,000th issue, they excerpted articles from various
years and this was one of the two they picked from 1990!
<hr>

<h3><a href=writing/pride.html>Pride and Prejudice</a></h3>
<p>
My only gay piece aimed at the gay community (and published in a
gay paper).  About prejudice in the gay community.  One letter.
<hr>

<h3><a href=writing/funny.html>What's So Funny?</a></h3>
<p>
This was my response to a homophobic comedian I saw at a comedy
club.  It was published in the Philadelphia Welcomat in
September, 1992.  It only generated one letter to the editor, but
nicely enough, the letter was from a co-worker I barely knew and
was extremely positive.
<hr>

<h3><a href=writing/kyw.html>Don't Trip Over the
Chevrolets</a></h3>
<p>
My silliest piece to date.  KYW is the all-news radio station in
Philadelphia.  All news, all the time!

<h3><a href=writing/pumpkin.html>Autumn Comfort with Whipped
Cream</a></h3>
This ain't very good writing, but it's a nice story and it's true!

<h2>The Contests!</h2>
