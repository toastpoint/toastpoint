I liked many of the haiku, of course, but the two most memorable for me were
the following:

Don McLeod (1/12)
Cold mountain morning
Glint of sunrise riding out
On the flyfish line.

Craig Chalquist (3/30)
After the layoffs
Parking spaces occupied by
Cold, shuffling leaves.

I also really liked the one from Kitamura (2/15) that began "Birches grow
both up" and the one from Aiko (9/26) that begins "Autumn emerges".  Another
nice one (I refuse to allow myself to list more than five) was the one from
Takemochi (2/15) that began "Why must you inspect".

The Toast Point page is my favorite place on the web; I hope it stays up for
a long time.
