A bun at a bakery<br>
Looked like the Romanian nun<br>
They call it nun-bun
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "True life story of a bun baked in a Nashville Bakery, looking
like Mother Teresa. An image is on the web too, I forget where.
The poet vouches striking similarity between the bun & the nun."</i>

<h3>Monique de Plume writes 01/13/97</h3>
Ant cities thriving<br>
Sudden showers flood the lawn<br>
Civilizations lost!
<p>
It is past midnight<br>
The airport is deserted<br>
It feels so surreal
<p>
The runner is sad<br>
He just won second place<br>
He is so jealous!

<i>The poet comments, "I thought I'd sometime write one on each of the seven deadly sins. This one, of course, is envy.
Anybody is welcome to continue the list."</i>

Love hunts down and wounds.<br>
There's no hiding: turn around;<br>
In pain, embrace love.

<i>The poet comments, "A friend and I, being displaced poets and posing as Coast Guard officers, often played little word games.  Our favorite was to look for haiku unintentionally(?) hidden within the glut of daily official correspondance.  This was my favorite, found in a quickly written note."</I>
