Bad Fiction Contest!</H1>
</center>
Welcome to the <em>Bad Fiction</em> contest!  
You select one of the genres of fiction, a suggested first line, and 
write a paragraph continuing the first line.  
You can use your own genre and first line if you wish.  
We also encourage continuations of previously-submitted entries!  Enjoy!

<h2>Novels of Length</h2>
The <em>novels of length</em> all began as simple entries in the contest, 
but were continued by another writer or two.  The participating authors 
then alternated chapters.  We are very proud of our novels of length, and 
all are still open for continuation:

Raptures</i></a> by B. Mushkeau and Flaneur le Beau
