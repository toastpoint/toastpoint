<h2>Homoeroticism in Children's Literature</h2>
This month - Sydney Taylor's <em>All-of-a-Kind Family</em>
</center>
<p>
The <em>All-of-a-Kind Family</em> series, written in the '50s, details the exploits of the five daughters (all-of-a-kind!) of a Jewish family on the Lower East Side of New York City in the early 1900's.  It's actually a very nice series and a good way for gentile kids to learn about some aspects of Jewish life.  However, Ms. Taylor may be expanding horizons in other, unexpected ways...

<I>Papa was always glad when Charlie returned.  It was not only because Charlie was Papa's right-hand man.  There was something special between Papa and this tall fellow, a man-to-man something.  Of course Papa loved his family, but sometimes he felt lonesome as the only man among six females.  At such time there was always Charlie he could turn to for companionship.</I>
<p>
The title of a later chapter, "A Family Outing", hints at how this situation might develop.

With one last gasp, the remaining huskies collapsed in the snow.  
"Oh, no" cursed the red-bearded logger "I'll have to walk across 
the glacier myself.  And it's 50 below.  But that's no problem for 
<em>Mandrake of the Arctic</em>."
<p>
Unpacking the provisions from his sled, he shouldered them in one 
large pack and began trudging through the snow, muttering to 
himself.  "If I don't get this serum back to the sawmill, Leon will 
die of frostbite malaria.  And I'll be all alone..."
