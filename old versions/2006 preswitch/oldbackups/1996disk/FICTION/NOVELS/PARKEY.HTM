Had a stranger passed the sweet shop that sunny summer afternoon, he would have shaken his head at the sight in the front window, sure that he was seeing double. Two young girls bent over a single triple chocolate marshmallow ice cream float, their impossibly curly corn-colored curls tied in gay blue ribbons, both with identical determined chins, freckled cheeks, and snubbed noses that seemed to connote both a love of fun and a stubborn streak. They wore the same smiles, as if they shared an infectious secret.
<p>
But there were no strangers in that small town in California, and <em>everyone</em> knew Patsy and Pansy Parkey . . .for they were twins, and identical at that!
<p>
It was Pansy who was greedily gulping down the last of the delicious triple chocolate marshmallow soda with her bent-neck straw.  "Patsy," she said, cocking her head. "I'm so glad we met for the first time at Camp Pocahontawatha two years ago this month when our long-divorced parents, who each kept one of us after they separated, accidentally sent us there at the same time without each other knowing."
<p>
Patsy grinned back. "Oh Pansy," she said, daringly wiping her slightly fudgy hands on her own light brown jumper with matching clam-diggers, identical to that which her twin wore. "Wasn't<em>The Case of the Kookoo Counselor</em> fun to solve?"  The other twin nodded in fervent agreement. "And remember how we tried to get moms and pops to reconcile, so we could live as one big happy family?"
<p>
Pansy whistled a little tune that Patsy recognized as their rock-and-roll tune, 'Let's Go Together, Yay, Yay, Yay', that they had spunkily played during an impromptu romantic dinner when trying to convince their parents that marriage was a lifetime proposition, despite their many, many, many differences. Then her face fell. "And then we had to solve <em>The Mystery of the Dead Divorcee</em>," she said sadly.
<p>
Patsy nodded in somber agreement.  It had been a sad time.  But nothing kept the Parkey twins sober for long!  "It was sad when Pops got life in the pen, Pansy," she said soberly.  "But then we moved to California to live with Aunt Polly, and now we're Teen Detectives!"
<p>
Her grin widening, Pansy added, "And now mystery's our thing!"
<p>

At that moment Alfie came by to remove the trash from their table.  "Hey, Tootsies!" he grinned at the twins as he adjusted his paper soda-jerk hat atop his nest of unruly golden curls; such a match for the twins' hair, for he was their Aunt Polly's only son, home from college for the summer.  "I'm surprised to see you here.  I was sure when that mysterious van from out of state started unloading plain brown boxes into the Old Hill House, you two would be all over it.  But I guess you don't want to start in on a new mystery so soon after solving <em>ThePumpkin Patch Puzzler</em>, and with less than a week until your yearly trip to Camp Pocahontawatha."<p>The twins looked at each other, and identical determined looks locked onto their faces.  "To the Mystery, and Beyond!" they sang in unison, and were out of the sweet shop like twin tornadoes.  Alfie looked down at the carnage on the table and sighed, "Well, I guess that's another triple chocolate marshmallow ice cream float on the house.  I've gotta work on my timing."
<p>
The twins barely stopped to catch their breath until they were safely hidden behind the overgrown laurel hedge that surrounded the Old Hill House at the edge of town.  Taking a small compact out of the pocket of her clam-diggers, and checking on the position of the sun, to ensure no tell-tale reflections, Pansy slowly lifted the mirrored side over the edge of the foliage.  "There's three men," she hissed to her twin, who wrote down all the potential clues with her waterproof pencil in the tiny locked notebook she had withdrawn from her over-the-shoulder pocketbook, "and the boxes aren't plain like Alfie said.  They've got writing on them."  She squinted into the tiny mirror,  "Oh phooey, it's so hard to read mirror images."
<p>
"Let me try," Patsy asked, "When Pops was in the Secret Service, he taught me all sorts of tricks, like that easy way to open a lock with a pencil..."
<p>
"..which we used to solve <em>The Dirty Dog Dilemma</em>!" they finished the sentence in unison, a trick that they often did.  Patsy took the mirror from her twin, and was just starting to raise the little compact over her head when a commotion caught their attention.  Suddenly, through the hedge burst a burly man, leading a large and unpleasant dog.  "Make that FOUR men," Pansy hissed.

<p>

"Golly!" said Patsy, absorbed by her spying and not hearing her sister's dismayed tone. "You're right! Several of the boxes say TERCES POT in big backwards letters!"  She lowered the little compact mirror, taking but a moment to inspect the freshness of her Tinkerbell lipstick as she closed it and put it safely away. "What does TERCES POT mean, do you reckon?"
<p>
Pansy's eyes flashed.  "I'm willing to bet it's not something you'd find in the kitchen . . . Pats!  You goof! It's not TERCES POT!  The mirror image of that would be. . . ."
<p>
The girls gasped at the wicked implications as they puzzled out the clue."<em>Top Secret!</em>" they said in twin-like unison with their eyes wide.
<p>
While Patsy made a note of the ominous words in her Official Parkey Twins Real Detective's Notepad with the Official Parkey Twins Real Detective's Secret Al-Pho-Bet Rotary Spy Decoder affixed in the back cover, available for a song at the local five 'n' dime, Pansy boyishly chewed a thumbnail.  "Jeepers, Pats," she said. "We might be in over our head this time!  Should I call Chief Hungwel on my Official Parkey Twins Real Detective's Secret Spy Two-Way Hand-Held Intercom, available at stores everywhere?"
<p>
Pansy's impossibly corn-colored curls bounced scornfully at the notion.  "Not when there's a MYSTERY afoot!" she said with resolve.
<p>
Suddenly, a shadow loomed over them!  It was the fourth man that Pansy had seen emerge from the gaping maw of the old house just moments before! His bald head and broad shoulders seemed even more ominous at close range.  "Hey Mr. Ragsdale!" he called out to someone in an accent that the girls, by benefit of the Official Parkey Twins Secret Eyeblink Semaphore, quickly identified between themselves as hailing from Hoboken, New Jersey. "Looks like we've got here a coupla nosy parkers!"
<p>
Patsy sat up indignantly.  She was angry!  So angry she didn't <em>care</em> how dusty her clamdiggers got!  "That's nosy <em>Parkeys</em> to <em>you</em>!"
<p>

The large dog, which until now had satisfied itself by just growling at the man's side, chose this moment to begin lunging and barking.  Pansy, using her Official Parkey Twins Secret Toe Tapping Code, was able to inform her twin, who was so much closer to the menace, that the dog was a Rottweiler/Alsatian cross, and might break free at any moment.  So, smothering her indignation, Patsy smoothly eased her notepad and decoder into the secret compartment of her pocketbook, and withdrew her phial of Official Parkey Twins Menacing Dog Deterrent.  But before she could discharge the phial's contents into the space between herself and the threat, the man was joined by another man, as scrawny and hairy as the first man had been burly and bald.
<p>
"Heh," guffawed the second man, "Nosy Parkeys, hey?  Remember when Mr. Ragsdale had us 'deal with' another Nosy Parkey?  That spy that we framed for his wife's death to get him out of our hair?"  He leered at the girls, and Patsy silently and swiftly signaled to her sister, once again employing the Secret Eyeblink Semaphore, to study the tell-tale tattoo on the scrawny man's left wrist.  Pansy signaled back their course of action, and the girls nodded in unison, then assumed vacant gazes.
<p>
"Golly, Mister" Patsy began, as Pansy allowed her tongue to loll out the
side of her mouth, her flashing blue eyes suddenly becoming dull as dishwater, "that's a swell doggie you've got there.  Is he friendly?  Sorry for shouting at you, but my sister hasn't been the same since the accident.  She's really fond of dogs, and goes wandering looking for them.  We never get to this part of town, but when she heard the dog, she went off, and I had to come find her to take her home.  She gets lost so easily, and Aunt Polly worries so much."  The girls knew the premise was lame, but in their eyeblink semaphore conference, they'd deduced that the two men were of limited intelligence themselves, and would probably (within a 35% error margin) be taken in by the 'Slow Sister Ruse' which they'd used to get out of a tight situation in <em>TheCase of the Careless Curmudgeon</em>.
<p>
The burly man smiled, almost in a friendly way, "Oh, Butch is a pussycat on the inside.  Just give him a biscuit, and he'll be your friend for life.  Here honey," he moved towards the now-drooling Pansy, "do you want to pet the puppy?"
<p>
"Shut up Bruno," the scrawny man cut in, "We're supposed to be guarding the shipment, not playing babysitter to re-tards.  Mr. Ragsdale's going to be bringing the boss around tomorrow, and we've got work to do.  Lookie here, Missy"  he addressed Patsy, who was still shocked at hearing the R-word (they were not allowed to use it in Aunt Polly's house), "Get your retard sister home, and stay in your own neighborhood if you know what's good for you"  He scowled at Bruno, and added in a lower voice "Now let's get the stash into the basement before the rest of the equipment arrives."
<p>
Patsy took her sister by the arm, and led her away from the house until they were out of visual range, then they sat down behind a fence, and looked at each other, "Golly, Pansy, you were grand at being the Slow Sister!" Patsy exclaimed.  Pansy smiled, "Well, while Pops was teaching you Secret Service tricks, Moms and I were in Hollywood, learning the tricks of the acting trade."
<p>
"Aren't we a perfect pair?"  they exclaimed in unison.  "Now let's get back to our Official Parkey Twin Mystery Solving Nerve Center and start working on <em>The Mystery of the Telltale Tattoo</em>"
<p>

<h4> Chapter Two: A Cunning Suggestion!</h4>
"Patsy, you goof!" hissed Pansy. "You'll ruin your canary yellow cotton
poodle skirt that goes so well with our baby pink summer angora sweaters
trimmed with imitation cultured pearls at the Peter Pan collar!"
<p>
Patsy caught her punch cup in time to save the precious skirt and its
darling embroidered poodle, whom she had christened "Sir Frou-Frou" in one
of the twins' lighter moments. "Oh Pansy," she said with a self-mocking
grin. "I guess I'm still puzzling over this afternoon's Mystery of the Mean
Movers! But it won't do to ruin my skirt with this delicious raspberry
sherbet punch or these simply scrumptious appetizers that the girls of the
4-H made!"
<p>
"Oh!" said Pansy. "I didn't see those! But isn't the Social Hall lovely
tonight? I think it's grand that that Town Fathers are throwing us an early
Farewell Sock Hop and Taffy Pull before we go off to Camp Pocahontawatha.
Not every girl gets one of those!"
<p>
"That's because not every girl is a world famous Teen Detective!" exclaimed
Patsy with a toothy grin. "But golly, Pans, hush up, because here comes
Annette Campbell, and she's sure to spoil our wholesome fun with her wise
cracks."
<p>
"Hel-<em>lo</em>, girls!" said Annette, coming up to the pair and giving
them the once-over. Obviously scornful of the twins' impossibly
corn-colored curls, she vainly patted her perfect helmet of hairsprayed
black hair and adjusted her skirt of Campbell tartan. "Going off to camp
again? How droll. I went to camp when I was a kid too, you know."
<p>
"And now you're just a full-grown <em>goat</em>, aren't you, Annette?"
snapped Patsy.
<p>
Annette pretended not to hear the cutting remark. "And now I suppose I'll
just have to keep your cousin Alfie company all . . . summer . . . long."
<p>
Pansy looked suspicious. "Alfie wouldn't give <em>you</em> the time of day,
Annette Campbell!"
<p>
"Oh, wouldn't he?" said Annette, her painted eyebrows arching in surprise.
"We were together just now. Alfie really knows how to pulls his taffy, you
know. I might have a better job for him too . . . working at my uncle's
amusement park. Uncle Wally just moved to Hillsdale this afternoon, and
he's looking for willing boys to help him in his business."
<p>
"How nice. <em>Bye</em>, Annette," said Patsy pointedly, as she feigned an
interest in the delicious 4-H peeled cucumber roll-ups with peanut butter
and Kraft mayonnaise . . . the perfect combination of body-building
proteins and vegetable fiber for growing Teen Detectives! As soon as the
tight-skirted girl sashayed out of sight, she hissed to Pansy, "Do you
think Uncle Wally could be the mysterious man in the house this afternoon?"
<p>
"Golly!" Pansy exclaimed. "You sure are smart!"
<p>

It was just at that moment that Pansy spotted their cousin Alfie, over
at the disk jockey's station.  He caught their eye, and loped over to
them, "That friend of yours, Annette, sure is a pill.  But I'll tolerate
her for your sake" he began, "though I don't see what you two Famous
Teen Detectives see in her."
<p>
The girls blinked in unison, "OUR friend?"
<p>
Alfie nodded, "She said you came to her for advice, and that she thought
you'd go so much farther if I was to quit my job at the Soda Shack and
work for her Uncle Wally.  While the wages are a nickel higher, I'd hate
to leave all the folks at the Shack".
<p>
Patsy was the first to stamp her white patent leather strappy toeless
dancing slipper.  Pansy wasn't far behind.  "We are NOT friends with
that creature" they exclaimed in unison,  "She behaves in a beastly way
to people, and her parents have always given us the creeps, ever since
they moved from Hoboken."
<p>
"In fact" Patsy added, almost conspiratorially, "when we ran the secret
Parkey Twin Felon Personality Evaluation on her father, he scored a 23."
The girls exchanged a most meaningful glance.
<p>
 Alfie was just going to ask if a 23 was good or bad, when Annette
returned, a distinguished moustachioed gentleman on her arm.  "Oh
Alfie!"  she cooed, "This is my uncle, Walter Ragsdale.  He's offered to
chaperone this shindig, and I thought you two could talk about your
future in the amusement park business."
<p>  Suddenly, Patsy grabbed her sister's arm, and hissed in her ear "Quick! 
Look at his wrist!"
