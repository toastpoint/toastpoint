Growing up in famine-struck Ethiopia,<br>
He thought of USA as Utopia,<br>
Where everyone has poise,<br>
Everyone has a choice,<br>
And of everything there is a cornucopia!

<h3>Da Brat writes 01/14/97</h3>
There once was a teacher named Jean.<br>
To her first period class, she was mean<br>
Her egg hadn't hatched - <br>
Her clothes never match - <br>
Who else would wear orange and green?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is about a certain chemistry teacher at my school..."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point shudders, remembering <b>his</b> horrible chemistry teacher.</I>

A promising poet from Arkansaw<br>
Wrote wonderful verses galas.<br>
  His ballads reached quight<br>
  An Olimpian hite,<br>
But his spelling had many a flore.
<p>
A man<br>
from Japan,<br>
when busy with a limerick's creation,<br>
always goes for the weirdest variation<br>
that he can.

On a business trip Charles Fourier<br>
Started winking at his clients in Korea.<br>
They found it bewitching,<br>
But his uncontrollable twitching<br>
Was found to be Huntington's Chorea!

In Beijing, Tim was the only wolverine, <br>
He had to buy a crate of tangerine - <br>
Struggled with the language, <br>
Finally, drew the fruit on a page,<br>
Fruiterer exclaimed "Aaver lenguage Mandarin!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Note: wolverine used as a person belonging to the state
of Michigan. In the last line, the fuiter says "Our language
Mandarin" The humor is two-ways. one, the fruiterer simply
exclaims at the difficulty of the language Mandarin, which
forced Tim to the extent of drawing the fruit. The second is
the fruiter telling Tim, that in their language, the fruit is
called Mandarin."</i>

<h3>Monique de Plume writes 01/13/97</h3>
My girlfriend Marie just went off and left me<br>
The meanest of cats that you ever did see.<br>
She thought I'd annex it - <br>
Instead I Fed-Ex'd it.<br>
You might say that I'm categorically free!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Just heard that Fed-Ex will ship animals."</i>
<p>
My cousin Joe Flynn, who's from Boston<br>
Went out in his little gray Austin<br>
He started to swerve<br>
Then flew off a curve<br>
And a mountain of snow he was lost in!
<p>
I once had a boss named Jim Gannett<br>
Who thought that the moon was a planet.<br>
He smoked a lot, too<br>
'Til the air was blue<br>
Thank God we were able to ban it!

As I bent down to tie up my shoe<br>
As I find that I often must do,<br>
I found one sock black -<br>
Alas and alack!<br>
'Cause the other sock surely was blue!

 Now will you just feature that!,<br>
A bird that just loves to combat, <br>

A hat worn by a gent, <br>
Forbidden by a plutocrat! <p>

While watching a pigeon fly by,<br>
I got something white in my eye.<br>
Now I didn't moan,<br>
But said with a groan,<br>
"I'm just glad that milk cows can't fly!"

There was a sailor called Ross,<br>
Who was fitter than anyone else was,<br>
Sailing slim on his boat,<br>
His secret, he would quote,<br>
`A rolling stern gathers no mass.'

I once knew a girl named Delores<br>
Who really could've used a thesaurus.<br>
Her vocabulary<br>
Was quite stationary<br>
At five thousand words moreorless.

The rich and ill industrialist Mr. Raj Gujraal,<br>
Would still wonder, though he was a know-it-all,<br>
`What is the point of having money,<br>
When even in a land of milk & honey,<br>
All I do is worry about fat and cholesterol!'

<h4>A Message Decoded by Voyager</h4>

"Sir, about an earth language, some advice - <br>
This `English' never fails to surprise,<br>
A meteor falls down to earth,<br>
And I just found to my mirth,<br>
The expression 'meteoric rise'!"

<I>The Sage couldn't resist tweaking it just a bit.</I>

<h3>A poet who lives in New Joisey writes 01/07/97</h3>
My teachers are driving me nuts<br>
Making us all kiss butts - <br>
They dress so horribly tacky<br>
And it drives us all wacky<br>
And we all want to hurl up our guts!

<I>Crispy, your safe-sex limerick was placed in the <a href=naut197.html>Naughty</a> section.</I>

Ramu argued that 'twas vague and not vagway - <br>
Teacher dismissed it as a slip of his tongway.<br>
When he argued again,<br>
He was stuck by a cane,<br>
And his teacher scolded "Don't argway, you rogway!"

<h3>Monique de Plume writes 01/07/97</h3>
A burglar named Picklock once made up a list<br>
Of items to pilfer that wouldn't be missed.<br>
A sly little elf<br>
He titled himself<br>
An ""Unauthorized Access Technologist"."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Last night, my husband and I were discussing concocted job titles. I thought
of one for a burglar, and of course, I had to build the house around the doorknob."</i>

If, to write a good limerick, you yearn<br>
Then from Toast Point's advice you would learn<br>
Of 'The Method':  Instead<br>
Of just scratching one's head<br>
To tapping one's foot one should turn!
<p>
<I>Exactly!</I>

Said a dirty old man called Jardine:<br>
"It's very important how you're seen."<br>
So en route to Milly<br>
He washed his... face<br>
And proclaimed: "Now I really am squeaky-clean!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "And so is the limerick! Or is it?"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage, amused, leaves it in.</I>

The detective agency picked him at random,<br>
"Prove Charges", read the issued memorandum,<br>
He worked silent and aloof,<br>
Under the burden of proof,<br>
Until he exclaimed "Quod Erat Demonstrandum!"
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Till my last breath I had valiantly fought,<br>
Against sourness and its cruel onslaught,<br>
In my blood I had drowned,<br>
That's how they had found,<br>
Me, a great shred of cabbage in sauerkraut!

<i>The poet comments, "Another example of how an open-minded language evolves, by 
borrowing words from other languages."</i>

While through life's options, we oft sift<br>
Hoping we might heal human rift,<br>
The birth of a child<br>
To a mother mild<br>
Embodies a most wondrous gift!

My cousin Hans from Delft<br>
Of fine graces was bereft<br>
  He thought, "Does it hurt<br>
  If for dessert<br>
I choose the fifth fork on the left?"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I don't know how wonderful this one is, but as a 
beginning limerick writer,
I'd really like to know the correct format. 
(Tho I don't promise to stick to it.
In the naughty limerick section, Premer wrote a skeleton form.  
Elsewhere I read that the meter should be anapestic; that is, 
di-di-dah--two short syllables followed by one long, stressed syllable.  
The dictionary says a limerick is a short witty poem with the first, second, and 
fifth lines longer than the third and fourth line.  What is the story?)"</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage takes a deep breath.  "The dictionary is correct, but not 
specific enough.  The meter should be anapestic.  The limerick you have 
submitted is close to correct, although the accents aren't perfect.  Try:<p>
</I>
My dear cousin Hanna from Delft<br>
Was of truly fine graces bereft<br>
She thought, "Does it hurt<br>
If for my dessert, <br>
I choose the fifth fork on the left?"
<p>
<I>Musically, there are some rests between the lines from the 2nd line onward, but 
those are the optional beats, so that is permissible.  And yours gets a 
gold star because it's clever."
<p>
Toast Point, being a musician, wishes once again he could place the limericks 
on a musical staff to show meter.</I>

After eating a meal the panda shot the waiter Jeeves,<br>
Before leaving, threw a dictionary, drawn from his sleeves,<br>
To the owner wanting to be paid,<br>
"Look me up" the panda had said,<br>
"Panda" he read " a marsupial, eats shoots and leaves."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Titled 'Panda in a Restaurant'. An overheard joke `limericized'"</i>
<p>
<i>Great joke!</i>
<p>
On the poor florist's face, massive worries loomed,<br>
The father of two sons definitely looked doomed.<br>
The cause of his plight,<br>
Were his sons, all right,<br>
For the budding geniuses had turned idiots bloomed.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "plead some concessions on meter for the humor."</i>
<p>
The famous adventurist Jacques Cousteau,<br>
Had a penchant for words portmanteau,<br>
Parking his motor near a hotel,<br>
He hit upon the idea of a 'motel',<br>
While filming 'Secrets of the Canal' in Rideau.

<i>The poet comments, "Work of fiction."</i>

I once knew a student named Sara<br>
As haughty as Scarlett O'Hara<br>
   She said, "Pandas are rahr<br>
   And duckbills are rahr<br>
And coelecanths even rahra."
<p>
<i>Is this Panda month?</i>
<p>
<h4>and shares and varies a classic</h4>
I sat next to the Duchess at tea<br>
It was as I feared it would be.<br>
Her rumblings abdominal<br>
Were truly phenomenal<br>
And everyone thought it was me!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This one was attributed to Woodrow Wilson. I wrote a similar one next."</i>
<p>
I hired a chap from Paree<br>
To work on my memoirs, you see -<br>
  But his style was pedantic<br>
  With words so gigantic<br>
No one would think it was me!

In the bug versus human war<br>
We draw on a chemical store.<br>
'Cause though we're bigger<br>
You've got to figure<br>
Their number is ten zillion more!
