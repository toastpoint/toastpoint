<h3>CeeJay writes 01/16/97</h3>
There is a young fellow called Dave<br>
Who keeps a dead horse in his cave.<br>
It smells worse than shit,<br>
But his neighbours admit<br>
That his goulash is what they all crave!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yummy!"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage glares at the poet.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Crispy writes 1/15</h3>
" Peccadillo" has same root in sin.<br>
As adjective "impeccable"'s in,<br>
While courage is "pecker"'<br>
Or something to wreck her,<br>
You can call it "Peter", and grin!
<p>

   pecadillo, dim. of pecado sin, fr. L peccatum, fr. neut.] pl of peccatus,

<I>Crispy has been writing limericks inspired by the Wordsmith Word of the Day.  We thank him for sharing them with us!</I>
<hr>
<h3>Psycho writes 01/14/97</h3>
Jeeves is totally right -<br>
Pamela Anderson Lee is a fright!<br>
She's such a witch<br>
A skank and a bitch<br>
Whose silicone pops out at night!

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 01/14/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A lesbian on a divan - <br>
A devoted fan of Elton John - <br>
Strove to name her vibrator,<br>
And a little while later,<br>
Stated, "He shall be 'leave on'!"
<p>
<I>Hee hee.  Toast Point has always liked that song, although like so many of Elton's songs, he hasn't a clue what it means.</I>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Do the limericks get special consideration if they use TP-provided first lines?"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage answers, "Nope.  They're just there to kick-start your brains."  Toast Point, however, is delighted when one of them strikes everyone's fancy, like the Pamela Anderson one this month.</I>
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A tight-assed young girl that I know<br>
Had me ream her 10 times in a row.<br>
Now cornhole-ing that lass<br>
Is a pain in MY ass!<br>
We truly reap that which we sow!

<hr>
<h3>Bertram Pantyshield submits a classic 1/14</h3>
There was a young lady from Sydney<br>
Who could take it right up to the kidney - <br>
Then a man from Quebec<br>
Took it up to her neck - <br>
He had a big one now, didn't he!!!!!

<hr>
<h3>CeeJay writes 01/13/97</h3>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Is a babe who's as big as can be.<br>
Her silicone valley<br>
Is where I would dally<br>
If I had a home by the sea!
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Needs no airbag in her car, you see.<br>
In laboratory tests,<br>
Some equivalent breasts<br>
Survived impacts of up to five g!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>Writerman</a> writes 01/12/97</h3>
A blight left the King's royal purse<br>
With but a gold rubber (perverse!)<br>
When his wife and child died...<br>
His Majesty cried:<br>
"My condom for a hearse!"
<p>
<I>The Sage looks askance at the poet.</I>
<hr>
<h3>Stargazer writes 01/09/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A lass with small breasts wished to raise them,<br>
For when guys saw their size, it would faze them.<br>
'Til a lad (Mark, by name)<br>
Said he swore that he came<br>
Not to seize her berries, but to praise them!

<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 01/09/97</h3>
<a href="#ww">WriterWoman</a>, you sound like a tease<br>
And your tits probably sag to your knees<br>
So from all of us guys<br>
That you fucking despise<br>
May your cunt be infested with fleas!
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Just received her divorce decree<br>
So to get through the day,<br>
With no one to lay,<br>
She bought a dildo the size of a tree!

<hr>
<h3>Emily writes 01/09/97</h3>
Charles Darwin was slow to direct us<br>
To the condor's uncertain prospectus - <br>
Consonantal mutation<br>
Means reincarnation<br>
As accessory to homo erectus!
<hr>
<h3>Monique de Plume shares a classic 01/09/97</h3>
I once met a fella named Roger<br>
Who married when he was a codger.<br>
His young wife was tight<br>
And try as he might,<br>
There was naught he could do to dislodge her.

<hr>
<h3>Dr. Dirty writes 01/08/97</h3>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Was the name of a bitch in Albany,<br>
She would get into trouble,<br>
With dogs, on the double,<br>
For they knew she was for free.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:apollohollow@msn.com>Crispy</a> writes 01/07/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
The patient, a sad sight to meet,<br>
Showed up with spots red as a beet,<br>
Which covered his mass,<br>
All caught from a lass,<br>
And not an ice cold toilet seat!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Free medical advice: Unprotected sex is risky."</i>
<hr>
<h3>A girl from Des Moines writes 01/07/97</h3>
Anne was a girl from Des Moines<br>
Whose cunt was the size of a coin<br>
Her sex was so wussy<br>
Tom Jones liked her pussy<br>
But she went to fuck Johnny Burgoyne.
<hr>
<h3>Bad Girl writes 01/07/97</h3>
The teachers are dressing like sluts<br>
Showing off all their butts<br>
They go to their classes<br>
Letting boys grab their asses<br>
And sucking on their nuts.
<hr>
<h3>Me writes 01/07/97</h3>
There once was a girl from Dubuque<br>
Who sat there and ate her own puke<br>
She picked her own ass<br>
And ate it in class<br>
Then ate cum from some dude named Luke.
<hr>
<h3>Aylith Andromeda Anderson writes 01/07/97</h3>
The once was a guy named Nate<br>
Who used a Tickle-Me Elmo as bait<br>
He was such a wacko<br>
Then he became Jacko<br>
And went home to masturbate.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is inspired by the joke...
"What does Michael Jackson call Tickle-Me Elmo? Bait!""</i>
<hr>
<h3>Dr. Dirty writes 01/07/97</h3>
Supposedly tasting like pussy, he had found,<br>
An apple, very red, voluptous and round,<br>
After taking a bite of it,<br>
Found it tasted like shit,<br>
And only then did he remember to turn it around.
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
On her pubes had a green bee,<br>
Which forgot it was a vector,<br>
While sucking her pubic nectar,<br>
Turning every man green with envy.
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
A teacher from whom you cannot flee,<br>
Would catch you between her tits,<br>
And hide you inside her pits,<br>
Just to teach you the meaning of 'glee'.
<hr>
<h3>CeeJay writes 01/07/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A New Zealand playboy named Greaves<br>
Has his girls each way round, but believes<br>
In abandoning dames<br>
After one night of games,<br>
For a Kiwi just eats, roots, and leaves.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is based on a joke like the one about the panda on the Squeaky-clean page, but naughtier.
You know, of course, that the verb 'to root' has a particular meaning down under...
Happy New Year to Toast Point, Sage and all your contributors!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>Jeeves writes 01/06/97</h3>
This time of year can be quite depressing<br>
I find my Christmas high spirts regressing<br>
My cure?  Piss on Prozac<br>
I'll get my wife on her back<br>
And have her cunt give my cock some caressing!
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Has tits that would float on the sea<br>
Those silicone pouches<br>
Have been on several casting couches<br>
Resulting in her contracting V.D.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sorry guys, but I think she is a serious ho-bag!"</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bwheel@ibm.net>Bill Ron</a> writes 01/06/97</h3>
Give me a limerick that smacks of smut<br>
Something that comes from your revolting gut<br>
I don't care for a poem of squeak and clean<br>
But one dripping of slime and green cream<br>
Yes, give me one that smells like an overused slut!
<p>
Come on you with the poems of dead whores<br>
We can still give them limericks with festering sores<br>
We may not use tales of green meat<br>
Nor of hermits named Dave may we speak<br>
So give them more slime disgusting to their cores.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Bill Ron has been out with the flu but is back with smut and goo."</i>
<p>
<I>Oh, goody...</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:bcasey@compuserve.com>Bill  Casey</a> writes 01/05/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There once was a con from Mt. Hope,<br>
With prison he just couldn't cope.<br>
'Til he met a fine friend,<br>
Straight to the end,<br>
By repetedly dropping the soap.
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There was a proud fucker from Cylon,<br>
With a dick the size of a pylon,<br>
'Til he zipped up his fly,<br>
And let a great cry:<br>
"Shee-it! I hope I look good in nylons."
<p>
There once was a man from Crete,<br>
Who triumphantly came on his feet,<br>
'Til the fateful day,<br>
He let a fine spray,<br>
And slipped, going down in defeat.
<p>
There once was a man named McNeer,<br>
Who said to his dear with a tear,<br>
"Your twat was hot,<br>
But now it's not,<br>
Flip over.  I'll do your rear."
<p>
There once was a trombonist named Art,<br>
Whose chapped lips would barely part,<br>
So whenever alone,<br>
He'd sit on his trombone,<br>
And practice Mozart with a fart.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My co-authors: my wife, Claudine Paris and my grandson, Dan Paris."</i><p>
<I>Toast Point has never met the poets, and is picturing a Grant Wood couple corrupting an eight-year-old child.</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>Writerman</a> writes 01/05/97</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A friend of mine back from the dead<br>
Assures me there's nothing to dread!<br>
No mean boss, nagging wife...<br>
No one says: "Get a life!"<br>
And the angels give heavenly head!!!

<hr>
<h3><a name="ww">WriterWoman</a> writes 01/04/97</h3>
The chill makes my nipples so perky<br>
And the wine makes me queasy and quirky!<br>
I'd give all you men head--<br>
But I'd rather drop dead--<br>
And I'd rather be eating beef jerky!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:daniellle1@hotmail.com>Dan'l</a> writes 01/04/97</h3>
A new year is ripe in the making;<br>
To count blessings, time I am taking.<br>
Her ass isn't big.<br>
She's never a prig.<br>
When coming, she seldom is faking!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I started to say "never" but how do I know?"</i>
<p>
Ms. Pamela Anderson Lee<br>
Hunted high and low for a tree.<br>
But out on the beach<br>
Trees are out of reach.<br>
(One never thinks stars have to pee.)

<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 01/04/97</h3>
This year's resolutions will cover<br>
The deep feelings I have for my lover:<br>
If she refuses to fuck<br>
On my terrace - bad luck -<br>
I'll still give her a kiss----------------then I'll shove her!
<p>
<I>Eek!</I>
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Ms. Nooky's a breath of fresh air!<br>
A female with cum in her hair!<br>
Who digs sex and shows it--<br>
Who licks it and blows it--<br>
And then writes all about it with flair!!!

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 01/02/97</h3>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
As a pen name, Nooky is grand<br>
But the one that makes my pecker stand<br>
Is Monique DePlume,<br>
From the "Squeaky-Clean" room!<br>
(I typed this with only one hand!)
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sex is only a mind game, after all."</i>
<p>
<i>Monique has joined us here as well!</i>
<hr>
<h3>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan writes 01/02/97</h3>
<h4>A Rhino's Plea</h4>
You animals come in throngs with popcorn,<br>
Insult by calling me an ugly unicorn,<br>
You wanna get horny, that's fine,<br>
Eat chocolate, wine and dine,<br>
But for Eros's sake, spare my poor horn !
<hr>
<h3>Monique de Plume writes 01/01/97</h3>
I once knew a fella named Jerry<br>
Whose pecker was small as a berry<br>
When he went to pee<br>
He let nobody see<br>
Though he thought it petite but not very!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto: rhubarb@nicoh.com>Rhubarb</a> offers more classics from the <a href=#pent>Pentatette archives</a></h3>
<h4>By MarcoM</h4>
Dorothy said to the Tin Man, "I'm trusting<br>
That you won't find my preference disgusting.<br>
But I'll take the Wizard of Oz<br>
And it's simply because<br>
Although his joint's limp, it's not rusting."
<p>
<h4>By Dick Buenger</h4>
The Bishop refused to ordain<br>
His deacon who could not abstain.<br>
Instead of The Book, he <br>
Would worship the nooky<br>
Procured from the choir, his bane.
<p>
For my organ of sex I concede it<br>
Is my pleasure to know whence to lead it.<br>
If it sits like a stub,<br>
I give it a rub.<br>
Let it never be said, "I don't knead it."           
<p>
<h4>By Irving Superior</h4>
The curse of gold.  When Midas ate<br>
Each dish he ate became gold plate.<br>
His daughter too<br>
Became Au,<br>
And when he had to urinate...
<p>
A professor of English named Ford<br>
Was writing a quote on the board;<br>
However in haste,<br>
He left out a space -<br>
THE PENIS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD.
<p>
<h4>By Lance Payne</h4>
Since their lust didn't have to be mastered,<br>
Kings "did it" whenever their ass stirred,<br>
And that explains why,<br>
Though a prince may rate high,<br>
A duke is so often a bastard!
<p>
<h4>By Ronald R. Jay</h4>
A royal handmaiden named Bess<br>
Caught the King in a state of undress.<br>
Said she, wet with pleasure,<br>
As her quim took his measure:<br>
"My ruler's twelve inches, no less!"
<p> 
<h4>By Martin Wellborn</h4>
I remember the night that I ate<br>
The girls' hockey team from Penn State.<br>
I worked my way round<br>
As they lay on the ground -<br>
Not unlike a wild rose - imbricate.<br>
<I>The poet comments, "Websters III : <b>imbricate</b> - overlapped at the margins"</I>
<p>
They've arrested a monk at St. Mallory's<br>
For molesting the nuns in the gallerys.<br>
"Just doing God's labor<br>
By loving my neighbor -<br>
Nunnilingus is only twelve calories."
<p>
<h4>By Margaret A. Murdock</h4>
A sensible man known as Guy<br>
One day asked his young bride, Miss Vi,<br>
When she would be stopping<br>
Her impulsive shopping,<br>
And she said that she would, buy and buy.
<p> 
<h4>By C. Webster Wheelock</h4>
A geology student named Victor<br>
Took his date to the river and dicked her.<br>
He admitted his fault<br>
In this heinous assault,<br>
But was proud of his 6 on the Richter.
<p>
<h4>By Michael Weinstein</h4>
A cheerleader named Betty-Jean Clark<br>
Drank some luminous paint for a lark.<br>
By December the cocks<br>
Of half of the jocks<br>
On the football team glowed in the dark.
<p>
<h4>By A.N. Wilkins</h4>
"Some precaution should not be despised,"<br>
The old Dean of Students advised.<br>
If the coeds here, friend,<br>
Were laid end to end,<br>
I wouldn't," he said, "be surprised."
<p>
(someone should apologise to Dorothy Parker)
<p>
<h4>By Neal Wilgus</h4>
Most limericks are so damn forgettable<br>
That it seems quite a shame and regrettable <br>
To waste so much time<br>
On mere meter and rhyme<br>
That won't fuck and don't pay and ain't edible.
