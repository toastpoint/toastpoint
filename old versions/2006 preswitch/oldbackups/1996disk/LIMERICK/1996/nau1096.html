<h3>Serious Player writes 10/29/96</h3>
They tell of a lass named Regina<br>
Who eloped with a gal named Edwina.<br>
Both were surprised<br>
When at last they surmised<br>
That neither gal had a vagina!

<hr>
<h3>Dyrt writes 10/28/96</h3>
The cast of <em>The Kids in the Hall</em><br>
Like to fondle with each other's balls.<br>
If you know what I'm saying,<br>
Their fondling and playing,<br>
Resulted in cum on the wall!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This page rules!"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:RandyB@DNC.Net>Gulliver</a> shares a classic 10/26/96</h3>
An atomic technician named Lil<br>
Took a chance on a nuclear pill...<br>
They found her vagina<br>
In North Carolina,<br>
And her tits on a tree in Brazil!
<p>
There once was a man from New Haven.<br>
For a good piece of ass he was cravin'.<br>
So he plopped it in mud,<br>
And gave it a thud, <br>
And said "Just think of the money I'm savin'"!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:http://www.travel-net.com/~ronl>Bobby</a> writes 10/25/96</h3>
Pulling his wire while cooking,<br>
Made him feel like a golfer who's hooking,<br>
But surprise was his fate,<br>
For while pulling, he ate,<br>
And his whole family was behind him just looking!
<p>
A naughty young lass from Largo<br>
Wondered how far that he'd go?<br>
So she pulled down her pants,<br>
And they were covered in ants,<br>
And they ate most all of his cargo!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
My gal is a wondrous lass,<br>
She'll lick both my balls and my ass.<br>
If I cum (and it's small)<br>
She will swallow it all -<br>
That girl has some kind of class!
<p>
<i>Bobby, if you submit your limericks all in CAPITAL LETTERS again, you will be flogged.</i>

<h3>Jeeves writes 10/24/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Said Slick Willy to the former Miss Rodham<br>
"There's two balls here and I am the one who's got 'em"<br>
Said she "True, you dumb hick"<br>
"Though you haven't a prick"<br>
"And your balls are well trained 'cause I taught 'em"!

<h3><a href=mailto:Xplosvman@aol.com>Xplosvman</a> shares a classic 10/23/96</h3>
There once was a man named Kent<br>
Whose dick was so long it was bent.<br>
To stay out of trouble,<br>
He stuck it in double<br>
And instead of coming, he went!
<p>
<I>No, Xplosvman, no dead whores!</I>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ronl@travel-net.com>Bobby</a> writes 10/23/96</h3>
There was a young man name of Fern,<br>
 His ass hurt so much it would burn.<br>
 He stuffed it with cum,<br>
 And it did help it some,<br>
 But for a cock he really did yearn.
<p>
There was a old man they called Kevin,<br>
 Up his ass he could take at least seven!<br>
 His piles were bad,<br>
 And made him quite mad,<br>
 When sometimes they'd sneak in eleven.

 I pray for an internet ban<br>
On limericks that don't even scan,<br>
But merely abuse<br>
Dear Erato, our muse.<br>
T'were best they were flushed down the can!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Limericks that don't meet the test of meter or rhyme should be banned."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point agrees, but in fairness, posts them anyway.  Once posted, other poets can ridicule the sender with their own perfectly-scanned limericks.</I>

Poor Morris, whose pals call him Dick<br>
(A name that pure logic would pick)<br>
Enjoyed making merry<br>
Partaking of Sherry<br>
At two hundred dollars a trick!

An elegant erudite Yankee<br>
Kept a condom wrapped up in his hankie - <br>

"I'm always prepared<br>
For sneezes or safe hanky-panky!"

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 10/20/96</h3>
A sex change removed both his stones.<br>
It was on the advice of sawbones.<br>
And now they must build<br>
His breasts, and he's thrilled.<br>
I hear what they use is whore moans!
<p>
Dolly Parton has two daffodils.<br>
When she stands, and I sit, I get chills.<br>
When she starts to sing,<br>
I say, "Ring-a-ding-ding,<br>
I will lift up mine eyes to the hills."

They tell of a lass named Hunt<br>
Who had a most odorous cunt<br>
The smell 'tween her thighs<br>
Attracted roaches and flies<br>
And caused growth in children to stunt!

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> shares a classic ...</h3>
A gay lost his boots in a game.<br>
And everyone said, "It's a shame."<br>
  The faggot was bootless;<br>
  The boots were quite fruitless,<br>
So he borrowed some shoes from a dame!
<p>
<h3>and writes 10/17/96</h3>
How he cried when he lost the election.<br>
In the ranks, there was lots of defection.<br>
  But this wasn't bad,<br>
  Or explicitly sad,<br>
As the day that he lost an erection.

<i>The poet comments, "Pentatette publishes good limericks, if you are a member. Box 365, Moffett, CA 94035. $20 a year.  This is a
group from Mensa, but anyone can join."</i>

<h3>The Balaclava Beauty writes 10/15/96</h3>
Reg, she is a Wiccan;<br>
In bed, she is a'dickin'.<br>
And, though some might think it kinky<br>
To use a feather on a winkie,<br>
Reg uses the whole chicken!

<h3>Boy Pilot writes 10/15/96</h3>
A strapping young man from Connecticut<br>
Got a lesson in sexual etiquette:<br>
It's not titillating<br>
While you are X-rating<br>
To be nipping away at a pedicut.
<p>
Said a nun to the Mother Superior<br>
"You have such a nice placid exterior,<br>
"But right now," she said,<br>
"We should head for the bed,<br>
And explore your more fiery interior."
<p>
The Web just has boundless erotica!<br>
Lots of trash, but also exotica.<br>
So I'd much rather surf<br>
Than just roll on the turf.<br>
It's so different it gives you habotica.
<p>
When one wants to purchase a teddy<br>
One really must get oneself ready.<br>
A fluff of the hair<br>
Up here and down there,<br>
And perhaps a quick fling with my Freddie.
<p>

I once had an outfit of leather<br>
Which couldn't survive rainy weather.<br>
The pants when they shrank<br>
Gave my jewelry a crank,<br>
My soprano scream rose from the heather.

They tell of a lass named Regina<br>
Who danced a real mean macarena.<br>
As she stripped off her clothes,<br>
Her best points to disclose,<br>
Said, "I'd rather a dance that's obcena' ".

Irrepressable Vidal Sassoon,<br>
On a fantasy trip to the moon,<br>
Tried to titillate Venus<br>
By disguising his penis<br>
As an elegant, golden bassoon.

I'm not married; I still live alone.<br>
And I have, since I broke up with Joan.<br>
  "But what about sex?<br>
  Do you have any prospects?"<br>
"It's not great, but I'm holding my own."

 A little old lady from Greece,<br>
 Had a very horny young niece -<br>
 She was always in bed,<br>
 Cause she like to give head,<br>
To the mayor and the Chief of Police.
<p>
A young man with a fine set of balls<br>
 Was scratching them in a barn stall.<br>
 The animals there<br>
All stopped and they stared <br>
 At the pitchfork that on he did fall.

There once was a poet named Jeeves<br>
Whose "rank meat"  gave Toast Point the heaves<br>
Said Toast "I will not publish"<br>
"This disgusting rubbish"<br>
Thus the poet sits and grieves!

I've heard a new drug has been born<br>
Makes you orgasm each time that you yawn.<br>
Now each boring speech<br>
By a political leech<br>
Is better than triple-X porn!

There was a young lady named Alice,<br>
Used a dynamite stick as a phallus.<br>
They found her vagina,<br>
In North Carolina,<br>
And a passle of assle in Dallas.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I saw a couple of postings of "Alice . . .", but I thought I'd post my favorite variation. The repetition of the "allas" followed by the reversal to two "assle"s before the final rhyme is just ducky ennit."</i>

Apologies to East Coast Bill, but the Man from Nantucket has been

Oh Sharet Oh Haret the girl we adore,<br>

And woke up with a handful of goo!

There once was a man from Molass<br>

There once was a man from Greece<br>

No lassie would give him a shake.

When a girl wants to purchase a teddy,<br>
She first needs to find one that's ready - <br>
If it's still in the store,<br>
Then her twat will be sore<br>
'Cause the poor thing was ready for teddy!

There was a man called Delzanic,<br>

Old Willy was kind of well-built,<br>
 You could tell by the tilt in his kilt -<br>
 It had a nice bulge,<br>
 As you probably could judge,<br>
 It was ten inches long to the hilt!

I once had an outfit of leather,<br>
 But I thought that suede was much better,<br>
 So I bought me a jacket,<br>

<I>This one, and <a href=#jeeves>its variation above</a>, are so revolting that Toast Point is going to ban it from the contest from this point on.  Various incarnations have appeared several times on these pages, and each one makes him gag.</I>

<i>Rhubarb comments, "Classics should also be eligible for a GOLD STAR too!"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point responds, "Classics, such as The Man From Nantucket, 
are already gold-star material - that's why they're classics!  In this contest, gold stars are 
reserved for original entries.  
If you're submitting an <em>original</em> entry for someone else (for instance, did 
Mr. Storer write that limerick?), list the other person as the author, check the "Did you write it yourself" box, 
and make a note in the comments section 
that you're the author's proxy.  Then the limerick will be eligible for competition."</I>
