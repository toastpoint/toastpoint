<h3>Phred writes 02/29/96</h3>
An ophthalmological surgeon<br>
Fixed a cataract lens on a sturgeon.<br>
Since the fish now could see,<br>
It wasn't long till he<br>
Swam away without any more urgin'.

Until one is long in the tooth,<br>
An unending search for the Truth.<br>
To reduce the time<br>
To reach the sublime,<br>
One should mix gin with vermouth.

Sometimes when I sit by the sea,<br>
The sound of the waves breaking free<br>
Relax my mind<br>
And induce a kind<br>
Of transcendent reality.

I'm sorry for sinking so low<br>
As to bash AbFab - a real cool show.<br>
AbFab's really fun<br>
And I hope it stays on,<br>
But those damn "Groovy Movies" must go!!
<p>
<i>Sweetie darling, glad you've come around...</i>

A German guitarist called Fritz<br>
Was murdered and cut into bits.<br>
When they found his appendix,<br>
It was marked "Jimi Hendrix"<br>
And listed the names of his hits!
<p>
<i>The Sage notes: Bizarre, but I like it!</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:tim@raptor.lpl.arizona.edu>Tim</a> writes 02/22/96</h3>
Gamera, I agree MST<br>
Was part of CC history,<br>
But I must say "Don't crab<br>
About gems like AbFab,<br>
Though you can trash Tracey Ullman for free!"
<p>
<i>Sweetie Darling, Tracey has her good points too!</i>
<p>
One day God said to John Paul<br>
"I'm really fed up with it all<br>
Since you got the white smoke<br>
You ain't told a joke<br>
You just bore me with dull Papal bull"

Moses ate food from a trough. It<br>
Was disgusting to see how he'd scoff it.<br>
He grew round like a ball,<br>
But was still loved by all<br>
Because everyone likes a "fat prophet".
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:rgdbcd@bbs.gemlink.com>Bob Davies</a> writes 02/21/96</h3>
Baseball caps were made for clinging<br>
When for a fly ball you're winging.<br>
But worn indoors?<br>
Only by boors<br>
And those with a poor upbringing.
<hr>

There once was a jester quite rude<br>
Who danced for the king in the nude!<br>
Old Cole roared:  "Wear a Tu-Tu,  <br>
Or you'll ride a fast U-2!"<br>
And decreed such behaviour "Too Lewd!"
<p>
Oh, a bow tie is always quite proper, <br>
Officious, and such a show-stopper.<br>
So, if you dress nude, <br>
Remember this, Dude: <br>
Be proper when greeting that copper!

<hr>
<h3>Da Homer writes 02/19/96</h3>
On America Online we had met,<br>
Falling deeper the closer we'd get.<br>
Then came time and place<br>
We would meet face to face - <br>
Then I lose her, but I'll never forget.

One day a man of good cheer<br>
Asked Descartes if he wanted a beer.<br>
What the man got<br>
Was "I think not"<br>
While he watched Descartes disappear!
<p>
The time of the telephone bell<br>
Says it's someone with something to sell.<br>
"How are you", they begin<br>
And I begin to sin<br>
By wishing that they'd go to hell!

Said Freida, the talking cat<br>
"I'll tell you where it's at -<br>
We have no objection<br>
To a little affection,<br>
But we'd rather have food and that's that!"
<hr>
<h3>Slade Grout writes 02/15/96</h3>
There once was a gossip named Sadie<br>
Who lived her whole life rather shady - <br>
"Talk is cheap", said the broad<br>
And my friend, with a nod<br>
Said "It is, but then so is the lady."
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:writrman@icanect.net>Writerman</a> writes 02/14/96</h3>
The next G.O.P. nominee -<br>
Who pray tell will it be?<br>
Bob Dole is too old -<br>
Pat Buchanan will fold -<br>
Which leaves it between you and me!

A friend who's in liquor production<br>
Owns a still of astounding construction.<br>
The alcohol boils<br>
Through old magnet coils;<br>
She says that it's "proof by induction."

Herzog, A guy I'd love to kill<br>
Axed MST for a thrill<br>
When MSTies asked why<br>
He'd just reply<br>
"To make more room to show Benny Hill"
<p>
Doug Herzog: that guy needs a slap!<br>
MST put CC on the map!<br>
Does he realize this? NO!<br>
Instead he'll just show<br>
AbFab and other such crap
<p>
<i>Toast Point <u>likes</u> AbFab</i>
<p>
A comedy called MST<br>
Was clearly the best on TV<br>
'Bots on the SOL<br>
Trashed B movies from Hell<br>
Too bad Herzog took over CC!
<p>
While drinking whiskey by the jug<br>
An MTV moron named Doug<br>
Saw what's obviously<br>
The best show on TV<br>
And decided to go pull the plug.
<p>
Doug Herzog, a guy with no shame<br>
Would not keep the time slots the same<br>
At 2 a.m. MST'd show<br>
Then when ratings got low<br>
Doug had only himself to blame.
<p>
Doug Herzog, that stupid d***weed<br>
Decided that CC would need<br>
A change for the worst<br>
MST would go first<br>
The whole network will prob'ly proceed.
<p>
Doug Herzog, a guy with no class<br>
Saw MST and decided to pass<br>
That guy's either sick<br>
Or as dumb as a brick<br>
Or drunk off his MTV ass!
<p>
Doug Herzog just makes me see red!<br>
"Try to see MY point" he said<br>
Well Doug, pardon me<br>
The only point that I see<br>
Is the one that's on top of your head!
<p>
<i>A little-known fact is that Toast Point occasionally 
dresses up like Mr. B Natural and dances around a giant treble clef.</i>

There once was a fellow named Hodges<br>
Who drove only Plymouths and Dodges.<br>
They were somewhat passe<br>
On the Champs Elysee,<br>
But admired at Rotary lodges.

When visiting underground sites,<br>
Remember which are stalagmites;<br>
Just picture the chance<br>
Of ants in your pants:<br>
When mites go up, down come the tites!

<hr>
<h3>Sylvie writes 02/09/96</h3>
A pious old poet and scholar<br>
Of a Sabbath, wears clerical collar.<br>
Each Sunday, he prays<br>
For a sinner to raise<br>
Up from sin, self-absorption, and squalor!
<hr>

<h3>Tomas writes 02/09/96</h3>
The news out of Bryan-College Station<br>
Created a worldwide sensation<br>
A roomful of Aggies<br>
With blowfish in baggies,<br>
Claimed at last to have conquered inflation.

<hr>

<h3>Anonymous writes 02/07/96</h3>
Lucinda, her marmalade spilling,<br>
Is all the young gentlemen thrilling<br>
As she butters her toast.<br>
The waiter's engrossed<br>
And burning the kipper he's grilling.

Meghan Walker</a> writes 2/5</h3>
There once was a slug from Seattle<br>
Who slithered off to fight in a battle.<br>
He stopped to drink a malt;<br>
It was filled to the brim with salt - <br>
He never did fight in that battle!
<hr>

<h3>Esme Vermiform writes 2/2</h3>
Oh God, here it's snowing again!<br>
It's freezing since I-don't-know-when!<br>
I long for the seaside,<br>
A sweet summer breeze; I'd<br>
Be happy six months hence...Til then!
