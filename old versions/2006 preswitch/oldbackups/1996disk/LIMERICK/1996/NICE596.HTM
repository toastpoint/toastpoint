<h3><a href=mailto:storyvil@iinet.net.au>Herkin</a> writes 05/30/96</h3>
Strolling one day in the Park<br>
I heard a dog learning to bark.<br>
As far as I could tell, it<br>
Had a badly cleft palette.<br>
"Mow! Mow!"  "Huff! Huff!"  "Mark! Mark! "

<h3>Sachin Kapur writes 05/29/96</h3>
There once was an old man from Kore<br>
Whose house had a very big door.<br>

Right on to his hand.<br>
Now his poor fingers are sore!

Winter's gone - ain't that something?<br>
Birds are again on the wing!<br>

That I gotta ask God:<br>
Pray tell - what have you done with our Spring?

And becoming the Poet Lariat!

<hr>
<h3>Courtney H. writes 05/24/96</h3>

He was covered in fleas<br>
From his head to his knees.<br>
When they saw him, people gasped in horror.

<h3>Rose W. writes 05/24/96</h3>

No matter what she did,<br>
They just couldn't be hid,<br>
Everyone made fun, which elated her foes!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A cross-dress from Crosby, called Sloane<br>
Bought a frock in a class of its own<br>
It filled all the places<br>
Where Sloane had just spaces<br>
And the boys wouldn't leave him alone!
<p>
On the plains I met grizzled Jake Cotter<br>
And his gal the Shoshone Chief's daughter.<br>
Her smile, it was broad,<br>
And her beauty unflawed<br>
I had some wampum left, so I bought her!

The patient gave vent to a howl,<br>
One long shrill, disarticulate vowel;<br>
"In his razor sharp talons<br>
My life's held in the balance - <br>
Help me doctor, I've swallowed an owl!"
<p>
The best surgical brains, cheek-by-jowl<br>
With world experts in night-flying fowl,<br>
Fought for almost a week,<br>
But that hideous beak<br>
Merely tightened its grip on the bowel!
<p>
They were ready to throw in the towel<br>
When the faith-healer rang - Reverend Powell;<br>
He advised them to pray<br>
And came round straight away<br>
With some string, a live mouse and a trowel.

<hr>
<h3>Walter Rollin writes 05/18/96</h3>
There was a lawyer named Hale<br>
Who always kept his clients from jail<br>
Until one was found guilty<br>

<h3>Rhymelust writes 05/18/96</h3>
There once was a nice T.V. addict<br>

And chanted: "Convict, fools, convict!"

There was a poor seamstress so meek<br>
That oratorical skills she did seek.<br>
But the tuition fee<br>
Was as high as could be;<br>
She had to keep working sew to speak!
<p>

A young stallion desiring an heir<br>
Dreamed of finding exactly the right mare.<br>
He arranged a blind date<br>
But found out too late <br>
That his dream filly was really a nightmare.

Stargazer reckons that Herkin pulled a boner<br>

She wasn't a Cleary<br>
Or Shaunessy-Leary,<br>
The bunch she belonged to was BRADY!

<hr>
<h3>Stargazer writes 05/10/96</h3>
Herkin's pun shows both genius and that elan<br>
Which is his, but for facts he's an addled man;<br>
Though I'm petty to kvetch,<br>
It's a bit of a stretch<br>
Putting Basques in a city that's Catalan!

<p>
<i>Stargazer asks: Am I insufferable yet?<br>
Toast Point will let you duel it out with Herkin!</i>

Competitions ‘bout limericks are won<br>
Mostly by wit and by pun<br>
And the judges you expect<br>
To choose a local select<br>
But here’s hoping for a non-native son!

<i>But everyone's a local on the Internet!</i>

There once was a man named Eponymous<br>

But I'll answer for either one of us!"

<h3>Herkin writes 05/06/96</h3>
Di's cellulite problem is shocking!<br>

Barcelona theatre.  A fire totally wrecks it !<br>

Who lived in a big copper kettle,<br>
In which he was playing<br>
His drumkit and saying:<br>

The Sage replies: 'No, not at all.  But Seattle/kettle?'</i>

A girl with eyes well attuned<br>
Alone for so long marooned<br>
Took comfort in the sight<br>
Of the stars late at night<br>
Distant hopes so brightly illumed.<br>

What remains to be said<br>
Left solely to be dead<br>
Will as soon wither away<br>
Like leaves dried, blown astray<br>
Than tell you instead<br>
