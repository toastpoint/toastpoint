<h1>The Toast Point Limerick Contest<br>
Brady Bunch Limericks</H1>
<h2>Here's the story...of a bunch named Brady...</h2>
That squeaky-clean family, the Bradys<br>
Were sent to us straight out of Hades<br>
Their suburban palace<br>
And housekeep named Alice<br>
All serve to make Toast Point a Fraidy!<p>

While mowing the Astroturf lawn,<br>
Greg worked up a raging hard-on.<br>
He ran into the kitchen,<br>
And despite Carol's bitchin'<br>
Boffed Alice until it was gone!
<p>
When Sam locked the kids in the freezer<br>
Bobby yelled, "Let us out, you old geezer!"<br>
But then Greg bared his tool<br>
And said, "Sam ain't no fool,<br>
Now give it up, you little cock teaser!"
<p>
There once was a family named Brady<br>
That wanted to hire a lady<br>
To do nothing but sit<br>
And rub Jan's lonely clit,<br>
But the whole thing sounded too shady.
<p>
Marcia's a horny young bitch.<br>
She got Mike alone in a ditch<br>
And started to scratch<br>
At her clean-shaven snatch<br>
And said, "Gee Dad, it don't even itch."
<p>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
At a party for only the Bunch<br>
Mike said, "Carol, I've got a hunch<br>
That Peter and Jan<br>
Are making out in the can!"<br>
"Alice!  What did you put in the punch!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, 
"After partaking of so many years of Brady entertainment, 
can we not afford to give a little back?"</i>

Since his lust wasn't satiated<br>
Pete asked Jan why they never dated.<br>
She said "Hop on in bed!"<br>
And while she gave him head<br>
He squealed, "Thank god we aren't related!"
<p>
Seeing big Greg whacking his winky,<br>
Marcia motioned to him with her pinky.<br>
she blew him and his mind<br>
Enthralling acrobatic 69<br>
Greg said "Marcia, I never knew you were so kinky!"

<h3>Sally writes 10/09/96</h3>
Is Alice a bulldyke or what?<br>
She's always playing with her twat!<br>
Someone else's would do,<br>
But she'd rather chew<br>
A nice one that is big, hard and hot!

The Brady Bunch plus Sam makes ten<br>
They had great orgies now and then<br>
Sam got Cindy, and Greg got Peter<br>
Mike had Alice - he loved to eat her<br>
That's how it went way back then, <br>
Girls had girls and men had men!

<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 09/09/96</h3>

The Brady girls, taking a chance<br>
Got into the Brady boys' pants - <br>
Soon one, then the other<br>
Was mounting a brother<br>
And now they're their own children's aunts!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Said Mike Brady, while stroking his phallus<br>
"Though I bear my wife, Carol, no malice,<br>
Since I've boinked all her daughters<br>
I'm testing the waters:<br>
A threesome with Peter and Alice."
<p>
Marcia Brady, whose features were flawless,<br>
Every week, on the show, would enthrall us.<br>
Then in dreams took top billing<br>
Where, bra-less and thrilling,<br>
She'd always be willing to ball us!
<p>
Jan Brady, the least of the lasses,<br>
Once had vision no pilot surpasses -<br>
But not being too hot,<br>
Had to stroke her own twat,<br>
Which she did 'til she needed those glasses!
<p>
At Sue Olsen's first tryout, she panicked<br>
When a voice barked "I doubt that she can act",<br>
But was soon taking heart<br>
When it said "Blow this part<br>
And you're Cindy -  to hell with the Mann Act!"

<h3>Raging Bull writes 09/05/96</h3>

"Screwing Brady girls," said my friend Farrell,<br>
"Is quite like shooting fish in a barrel.<br>
I liked Marsha and Jan,<br>
Cindy made me a fan.<br>
But I especially loved nailing Carol!"
<hr>
<h3>Quilis writes 08/21/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The Bradys had a neighbor named Stan<br>
A pathetic excuse for a man<br>
The horny old putz<br>
Liked fondling the butts<br>
Of Marcia and Cindy and Jan!
<p>
<h3>Quilis continues 08/27/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Soon an oversexed neighbor named Peg<br>
Started flashing Mike Brady some leg<br>
The old gal was so loose,<br>
She also tried to seduce<br>
Bobby and Peter and Greg!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:brabant@ix.netcom.com>Javeal</a> writes 08/08/96</h3>
When Carol picked out the shag carpet<br>
And Alice went down to the market,<br>
Jane had to feel *nice*,<br>
But she had no price<br>
So Greg took the option to take *it*!
<hr>
<h3>BradyManiac writes 08/02/96</h3>
The kids' bathroom toilet is missing<br>
There is no commode there for pissing<br>
So the kids must, of course,<br>
Use that damn plaster horse<br>
And Alice must keep the thing glis'ning.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:TEDSTR@aol.com>George Glass</a> writes 08/01/96</h3>
Jan's got a big, bushy beaver<br>
That's never been cleansed with a cleaner.<br>
Tiger got whiff<br>
And started to sniff<br>
And THAT's what happened to Tiger!!
<p>
Greg and Marcia both needed a shower<br>
Each sibling had just one half-hour<br>
Saving water and time<br>
They shared, only to find<br>
Bobby peeking in with his video camera.
<p>
While spinning at the Brady square dance<br>
Cindy got dizzy and shit in her pants<br>
She ignored the smell and didn't really seem to mind<br>
Until Bobby ran up and slapped her behind<br>
