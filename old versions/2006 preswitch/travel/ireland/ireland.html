<h3>
Background</h3>
The Wumpus and I wanted to take a <i>real</i> vacation this year and I'd
always wanted to go to Ireland or Scotland. We haven't done England yet,
but feel we needed more time than we had (a week and a half, tops). We
looked at the two little countries and got a much better travel deal on
Ireland, so off we went. We left on Wednesday night, August 30th and got
back Sunday, September 10th.
<p>Since during the summer, I was insanely busy and the Wumpus had almost
nothing going on, he (mostly) graciously did the research and planning.
After consulting travel agents, websites and all, he ended up getting us
a good deal with <a href="http://www.aerlingus.com">Aer Lingus</a>. Their
deal was similar to a lot of others offered, but was less expensive. We
got:
<ul>
<li>
Air fare</li>

<li>
Hotel vouchers for every night but one</li>

<li>
A rental car for a week (meaning the time we were not in Dublin)</li>
</ul>
The hotel voucher thing was interesting. Basically it let us show up at
any hotel on their list (assuming they had a room) and just hand them a
voucher to pay. Some hotels were nicer and you had to give them a couple
of extra pounds on top of the voucher. We could have gone with Bed and
Breakfast vouchers instead (cheaper), but we weren't that adventurous and
wanted our own bathroom. Always.
<p>The hotels were all pretty nice and we got breakfast as part of the
deal at each one. More on that through the tale.
<h3>
The Route</h3>
<img SRC="pictures/smallireland.gif" ALT="Map of Ireland"  align=RIGHT> Ireland
is actually two countries, the part that's free (most of it) and the part
that's still under British rule (the upper corner). Northern Ireland is
where all the fighting happens, so we avoided that. We flew into Dublin
(middle right), the biggest city in Ireland, and spent four days there,
then drove down the south coast town by town and all the way up to Galway
(about where that "West" icon is). We then backtracked and flew out of
Shannon.&nbsp;
