I, <b>Carla "Luvmuffin" Arouse</b>, have created <b><i>The Cool Cruel Web Page</i></b> to aid me in my quest for <U><I><B> World Domination</B>.</I></U>.  
Soon, with the aid of my tattooed, pumped-up sisters of pain and torture,
I shall control all!<p>
My "sister", the comtemptuous Erna Mae Arouse, may attempt to
thwart my plans, but it will come to nothing, as she has yet to
even find a pair of falsies that fit her!  Going by the name of 
<A HREF="http://gopher.orsps.wayne.edu/crab/arouse.html">Caresse</A>,
she does all she can to subvert my awesome power.  But her
pathetic efforts can do nothing, as she scratches away at that awful itch she
always has.<P>
So my page has no links, slimeworm?  Patience, all will be revealed soon.
In the meantime, stop by and visit!  You can find me at Carla's Tattoo 'n' Torture, 
my favorite bar, the "Tilt of Your Kilt", or around Manhattan in the more interesting places.

See what a disease-ridden whore my <A HREF="http://gopher.orsps.wayne.edu/crab/arouse.html">sister</A> is.
