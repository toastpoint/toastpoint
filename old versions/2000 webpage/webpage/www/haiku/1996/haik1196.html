A blustery day -<br>
even the fish curl up with<br>
a good book to read.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "As always, please ask
your readers to let me know
if this work touched them.

And thank you for this forum!"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point grins.  "You're welcome!"</i>

You may read these lines<br>
But don't keep them in mind: it's<br>
A one-way haiku
<p>
<i>Stefan, it's correct and very nice!</i>
<p>
<h3><a href=mailto:forester@brainerd.net>Danielle Shea</a> writes 11/29/96</h3>
Seen structure of light<br>
Glowing from the majestic<br>
outrageous, moon beam.
<p>
Moon and stars collide<br>
Into the sunset of love.<br>
Making us wonder.
<p>

Kirk asks, "What is it?"<br>
"Checking tricorder", says Spock.<br>
Bones adds, "It's dead, Jim".
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Dialogue from almost every episode of Star Trek.  
Who knew it was a higher art form all along?"</i>
<p>
<h3>Dooley Mudpuddle writes 11/28/96</h3>
Knees lift high over<br>
Drifts of snow, hard and bloody<br>
Work, two bits a day
<p>
Eyes growing weary<br>
Legs too short for the footstool<br>
All my pets have died
<p>

fell burning from heaven, and<br>
drowned into the sea

Crimson-tipped leaflets<br>
Glazed in a feathery frost.<br>
Crystalline sparkles.

<h3><a href=mailto:sjb4@acpub.duke.edu>Sara Burchell</a> writes 11/24/96</h3>
I, soft and naked<br>
sitting and waiting at night<br>
searching for my dream

Whispering secrets<br>
The cool wind growing colder<br>
November dancing
<p>
On near-naked trees<br>
sparrows scurry - noisy leaves<br>
prepare for winter
<p>

<I>Welcome to the internet, Larry!</I>

Nepotism is a<br>
nonrepresentational<br>
opportunity

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I never liked her.<br>
When I heard she was dead, I<br>
Dissolved in laughter.
<p>
Cause for much regret. <br>
Later, I cried because I<br>
Had hated her so. 
<p>
I don't remember<br>
Our last argument.  Something<br>
Trivial.  But still. 
<p>
When I knew her, I<br>
Wished her dead.  I find it strange<br>
That I miss her now.
<p>

Sparrows flying South<br>
Rain drops on dark grey feathers<br>
Flight to warmer climes.

<h3><a href=mailto:holmanza@mlckew.edu.au>Holmanza</a> writes 11/24/96</h3>
Matthew is a priss<br>
In his scout leader outfit<br>
Let's give him a miss.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This haiku can be changed depending on how you 
feel about the Matthew in your life by changing miss to KISS!"</i>

The chill embraces<br>
My soul in its icy cloak.<br>
The sun is no more.

Yellow crop duster <br>
Swooping low,  then floating up<br>
Trails of white descending

<h3><a href=mailto:jonesb2@lasalle.edu>Broderick AR Jones</a> writes 11/22/96</h3>
The moon shines above<br>
Beams of madness fall toward<br>
Earth, and the waves move
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
My neighbor's garden<br>
glossy green grass grows, always<br>
More cheerful than mine
<p>
Rose, the sweetest smell<br>
Water drops off its petal<br>
An ocean of scent
<p>
In the grass jungle<br>
The mantis stalks the lady,<br>
No refuge for bugs
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These Haiku poems are a thank you to Jennifer, and Nicole.  They have lifted my spirits without even knowing.  Thank you ladies. 
-Broderick-"</i>

A hidden nest somewhere<br>
from a brooding blackbird<br>
completes my garden.
<p>
shouts of joy<br>
from children in the garden<br>
romping with water
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
One fierce gust of wind<br>
an acorn bombardment<br>
A deer-park's high-day
<p>
A violent row<br>
like a crashing thunderclap<br>
cooling down at once
<p>
A carp, motionless<br>
underneath the water surface<br>
staring face to face
<p>

No color, no art;<br>
A lonely land lacking life:<br>
In it, I am trapped
<p>
I can remember<br>
the soft sound of singing birds.<br>
Now, there is silence.

Purple dragonfly - <br>
flutter aimlessly through my<br>
dreams -- this is freedom.

few have become the many do we take notice."</i>

Sweet perfumes carpet her path:<br>
The radiant bride.

Bright smiles and giggles<br>
Fill our house with happiness;<br>
Our grandson is here.

Ornate, yet so dull<br>
access to the other side<br>

Any comments would be appreciated."</i><br>
<i>The Sage likes it, except he feels the reader should be at least able 
to guess what the subject is (if you hadn't told us, we wouldn't have a clue).</i>
