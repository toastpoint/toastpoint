Like the tide rolls (rolling?) in<br>
on sand castle builders,<br>
time destroys all things.

<i>The poet comments, "This is my first haiku. I'd like to know if a word that is two or more syllables in the dictionary can be pronounced
as though it is one syllable.  For example, "castle." Usually you can change things around to fit the format, but sometimes, I think
a poem may lose a little (or a lot) in the effort. Is it worth it to be so strict? Can I get some experienced haiku writer to offer their opinion?"</i>
<p>
<I>The Sage offers, "Some two-syllable words can be pronounced as one syllable, but 'castle' is not one of them."   He would rewrite the first line to "Like tide rolling in".</I>

Jelly-fish in sea <br>
movements here so elegant -<br>
a pudding on the beach.

In the falling snow,<br>
We met by the frozen pond -<br>
Two hearts are burning.

Thundering through the wild sky:<br>
The cry of mother....
