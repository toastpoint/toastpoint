verbalize, he puts into every loaf.

The wind is blowing <br>
through the trees in the forest,<br>
whistling a song
<p>The snow is falling <br>
coloring everything white,<br>
masking ugliness. 
<p>The wind is blowing,<br>
swirling snowflakes around me,<br>
making me dizzy.
<p>The sun is rising,<br>
shining a brilliant light,<br>
destroying shadows.
<p>Pumpkins and candy,<br>
ghosts, ghouls, goblins, and monsters.<br>
Happy Halloween!
<p>I swing mightily<br>
sending the ball up skyward,<br>
only to splash down.

disturbed silence<br>
a ripple in the water<br>
sigh of my love.

wind blows through<br>
water changes course too.
<p> a mud-stained <br>
feather wears my soul<br>
once the wind blowed.

Day in and day out

From mountains to the valley<br>
Multi-colored trees

that it was dying

<i>The poet comments, "Originally called <b>Master & Slave</b>.   Overheard in a crowded
room from a woman violently shaking her pen.  Heard the pen's exhausted reply above the noise of
glasses and cutlery.  I couldn't take my eyes off her until she finally put it down on the table. "</i>

When autumn is late,<br>
The colors that lift my soul<br>
Test my memory.

Misty morning day<br>
Encloses me silently<br>
Clouds cover the sun.
<p>
Rain falls like the tears <br>
off a child's chin, despairing<br>
moments turn to joy.

One in a million succeed<br>
I will make it two!
