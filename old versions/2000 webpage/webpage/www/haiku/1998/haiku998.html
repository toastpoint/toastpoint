Small ponds froze last night . . .<br>

<h4>Fancy That</h4>
Chocolate eclairs<br>
Are made from choux pastry and<br>
Eclair means lightning.
<p>
Choux is the plural<br>
Of chou. Chou is a cabbage.<br>
Eclair is lightning.
<p>So when you eat your<br>
Eclair, you're eating lightning<br>
Made of cabbages.
<p>
<h4>Learn That Little Trick</h4>
We pour scorn on cows<br>
Even though their calves can walk<br>
As soon as they're born.
<p>
Whereas we humans<br>
Need a couple of years to<br>
Learn that little trick.
<p>
<h4>God Bless America</h4>
They went right down to<br>
The proverbial wire. God<br>
Bless America.
<p>
<h4>Proverbial Hats</h4>
Amazing, what? Grown <br>
Men hitting balls with bats and<br>
Reinventing stats.
<p>I get my morning<br>
Paper at five a.m. Dawn<br>
Has not yet broken.
<p>And the only thing <br>
I want to know is 'Has the<br>
Record been broken?'
<p>
<h4>Wherever and Forever</h4>
Wherever you look,<br>
This summer's been a bummer.<br>
Clinton and Asia.
<p>But diamonds, it<br>
Seems, baseball or otherwise,<br>
Are still forever.

Joy bubbles inside<br>
Butterflies in my stomach<br>
What is this I feel?
<p>A familiar thing<br>
Seen in a different light<br>
I love you tonight
<p>Softly falls the rain<br>
To cleanse all across the land<br>
Erasing my pain

<h4>Kissing The Nurse</h4>
I don't quite get this.<br>
When I see the nurse, I give<br>
Her a kiss. What's this?
<p>
Where did this come from?<br>
I've got a minor problem.<br>
I'm kissing the nurse.
<p>
<h4>Fasten Your Seatbelts</h4>
She's got chocolate <br>
Skin. Maybe that's the reason<br>
I flagrantly sin.
<p>I'd keep my distance<br>
If only she'd put up some<br>
Resistance. She don't.
<p>Au contraire. Like a<br>
Chocolate eclair, she melts.<br>
Fasten your seatbelts.

<h4>Utter Pradesh</h4>
Sitting on the stoop<br>
Looking at the weather. This<br>
Is not Rawalpindi.
<p>
My father spent World<br>
War Two in India, with<br>
The fighting Gurkhas.
<p>Unbelievably,<br>
The name of the area<br>
Was Utter Pradesh.
<p>Utter Pradesh. I<br>
Ask you. He spent the war<br>
In utter pradesh.
<p>
<h4>Utter Rubbish</h4>
And furthermore, folks,<br>
His sergeant-at-arms was called<br>
(Gasp) Sergeant Pepper.
<p>There really was a<br>
Sergeant Pepper and he lived<br>
In Utter Pradesh.
<p>And he thought Lucy<br>
In the sky with diamonds<br>
Was utter rubbish.
<p>
<h4>Utterly Wrong</h4>
Newspaper taxis<br>
Appear on the shore waiting<br>
To take you away.
<p>Sergeant Pepper was<br>
Pronounced Sarn't Pepper. Sarn't as<br>
In my sainted aunt.
<p>He dismissed out of<br>
Hand attempts to organise<br>
Lonely Hearts Club Bands.

A lavender bloom<br>
Cloaked in drops of morning dew<br>
Bows in reverence.
<p>
Tears sliding down my<br>
Ruddy cheeks as frustration<br>
and despair mingle.
<p>
The sun is shining <br>
The tadpoles jump from the banks<br>
Of a secret lake

mountains rumbled as we made<br>
love before the gods.

<h4>He Sighs</h4>
I view with fear and<br>
Loathing the coming winter's<br>
Layers of clothing.
<p>
Now it's the turn of <br>
Generation X to seek<br>
And discover sex.
<p>Talking heads full of<br>
Neurotransmitters may not<br>
Transmit very much.
<p>Their patter, their spiel,<br>
Is usually designed<br>
To cloak and conceal.
<p>Everyone will have<br>
A concrete opinion to<br>
Support his image.
<p>Unbeknownst to dreams<br>
The dreamer is looking for<br>
Underlying themes.
<p>Who will kiss the man<br>
With a cleft palate, a hare<br>
Lip and a thick lisp?
<p>Alternative this,<br>
Alternative that, all of<br>
Them superlative.
<p>Crime and punishment<br>
Seem like a befitting theme<br>
To underly dreams.
<p>Who would be so bold<br>
To suggest he wouldn't mind<br>
Growing sagely old?

<h4>Now He's Got a Good Name</h4>
Sinbad the Sailor.<br>
Sinbad. So called because he<br>
Both sinned and was bad;
<p>Although, Lord above,<br>
Somehow or another, his<br>
Name came to mean good.
<h4>Men Playing Being God</h4>
Jehovah's witness<br>
Knocks at my door and says<br>
"What are you living for?"
<pIt's Sunday morning.<br>
Jehovah's witnesses go<br>
Round on holy days.
<p>I think 'Now there's an<br>
Odd question for a perfect<br>
Stranger to ask. Pass.'
<p>Silence. She puts it <br>
Another way. "What problems<br>
Confront us today?"
<p>I thought 'Two can play<br>
At being odd.' I said "Men<br>
Playing being God."
<p>
<h4>Anonymity Averts Animosity</h4>
Let me tell you, bro.<br>
Only men can write their name<br>
In the snow. You know?
<p>
I pay insurance<br>
For reassurance. They take<br>
My money and laugh.
<p>Poverty implies<br>
Fiscal impropriety.<br>
White trash without cash.
<p>The retrieval of<br>
Deceitful discoveries<br>
Reinforces lies.
<p>"Hot off the presses,"<br>
News vendors once cried. "Read all<br>
About it," they lied.
<p>Actions speak louder<br>
Than words. And they speak loudest<br>
When they're gunpowder.
<p>It's a pity that<br>
Intellectual sounds like<br>
Ineffectual.
<p>Learning by rote seems<br>
To imply that parrots are<br>
Wise. Don't ask me why.

<h4>My Friend Beats The Clock</h4>
We have eyes to see<br>
That we're morally blind but<br>
They're poorly designed.
<p>
This jerk does his work<br>
At maximum revs. Full speed<br>
Ahead. Beat the clock.
<p>In spite of the fact<br>
That he can never win, he<br>
Will never give in.
<p>Which, on the surface,<br>
Is wholly reasonable.<br>
How could you quibble?
<p>What lies underneath<br>
So neatly encapsulates<br>
Our love of a lie.
<p>Whilst busy saving<br>
Labour we have turned ourselves<br>
Into slave labour.
<p>We are slaves of the<br>
Machines we invented. We<br>
Have lost what we saved.
<p>There's one strikingly<br>
Simple example. The clock.<br>
The wrist and stop watch.
<p>Man first noticed that<br>
He needed clocks after he'd<br>
Invented railways.
<p>Railways had to run<br>
On time so railway stations<br>
Had to have big clocks.
<p>Upon entering<br>
A railway station you were<br>
Presented with time.
<p>But what did you do<br>
The rest of the time? Run out <br>
To the sundial?
<p>Turn the hourglass<br>
Upside down? Well, yes. It was<br>
A lot of labour,
<pFinding the time. So<br>
The men with the brains made a<br>
Clock for everyman.
<p>Thereby enslaving<br>
Every man to time. Like my<br>
Friend who beats the clock.

<h4>Hebrish</h4>
If you want to watch<br>
Monday Night Football in the<br>
Holy Land (say what)
<p>
What you get is a<br>
Travesty. You get Hebrish.<br>
You get gibberish.
<p>You get no fewer<br>
Than five commentators, of<br>
Whom two are speaking
<p>All of the time. One<br>
In English and the other<br>
In Hebrew. Hebrish.
<p>
<h4>It's A Paradox, Alright</h4>
Furthermore, there is<br>
An astonishing contrast<br>
In delivery.
<p>The American<br>
Commentators are juiced. The<br>
Israelis are loose.
<p>This is because the<br>
Americans feel loose, and<br>
The Israelis, juiced.
<p>
<h4>Touchdown.  Wow</h4>
Our transatlantic<br>
Cousins do a lovely loose<br>
Job of being juiced.
<p>
But their Holy Land<br>
Counterparts are overawed.<br>
They try to sound bored.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Their intention is<br>
To give the impression that<br>
They are unimpressed.
<p>They aim to be cool<br>
By being nobody's fool<br>
But can't hide their drool.
<p>This mindset results<br>
In an insufferable<br>
Monotonic drone.
<p>Broken only by<br>
An occasional strangled<br>
Cry of 'Touchdown. Wow."

<h4>Bitching</h4>
Glitches are often<br>
Brought on by witches, which is<br>
What's happened to me.
<p>I've been glitched beyond<br>
Repair. Hours of work have<br>
Gone up in thin air.

<h4>Shooting for the Moon</h4>
I consistently<br>
Underestimate me. This<br>
Is fairly easy.
<p>You would think a man<br>
Would know himself better than<br>
He knows someone else.
<p>But men are beset <br>
By complexes. For instance,<br>
Battles of sexes.
<p>And simplifying<br>
Contradictions is, I fear,<br>
Shooting for the moon.

<h4>The Twang of Umbilical Chords</h4>
The quickness of our<br>

Thinking life is fast.

Be umbilical.

<h4>I Am A Breast</h4>
I have a day job<br>
That consists entirely of<br>
Feeding mother's milk.

Words, a breast. A fact of which<br>
I am not abreast.

<h4>Under Your Spell</h4>
Knowing full well I'm <br>
Under your spell means that I<br>
Don't feel very well.
<p>
Good God almighty,<br>
There's a fight going on. It's<br>
Between good and bad.
<p>Rivulets of sweat<br>
Trickle and tickle and make<br>
My shirt soaking wet.
<p>I'm in need of a <br>
Boost, which is most unusual,<br>
As I rule the roost.
<p>Having something to<br>
Look forward to makes the clock<br>
Move as though through glue.
<p>I bought myself a<br>
VCR because I wished<br>
To watch Pulp Fiction.
<p>Over and over<br>
And over and over and<br>
Over and over.
<p>And tonight, if all<br>
Goes well, I will at last be<br>
Put under its spell.
<p>
<h4>Contrasting Lifestyles</h4>
But first several hours<br>
Must shuffle past. Hours that last<br>
Far longer than hours.
<p>But first I must milk<br>
My cows. I shall reflect on<br>
Contrasting lifestyles.

<h4>Or A Guitar Riff</h4>
Turn the other cheek,<br>

Do all the talking.
<p>Are you leading a<br>
Double life? Are you troubled<br>
By your triple life?
<p>Some do. Some don't. Some<br>
Can. Some can't. Some say they will<br>
But you know they won't.
<p>Sometimes someone sums<br>
Up everything with a sniff.<br>
Or a guitar riff.

On the staus quo.
<p>Pie-toon doesn't know<br>
That I would rather his voice<br>
Than the radio.
<p>Unfortunately<br>
He knows that I like to play<br>
The piano. So,
<p>I'd say he must be<br>
Looking for a piano<br>
On the radio.
<p>Sadly, I'm quite right.<br>
Imagine his dismay when<br>
I change the station.
<p>Fortunately, I<br>
Do not do this dastardly deed<br>
Demonstratively.
<p>I do it with all<br>
The politesse that we old<br>
English gents possess.
<p>Hopefully, this makes<br>
My rebuff of his friendly<br>
Gesture bearable.
<p>Why must I rebuff?<br>
It's the story of my life.<br>
Being odd is tough.

Poetic justice. They don't<br>
See (how could they?) that

Voice of the solitary<br>
Man who hates to speak.

They will undoubtedly be<br>
A tough nut to crack.
