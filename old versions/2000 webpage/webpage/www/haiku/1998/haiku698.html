birthing our fall crops

Amidst greens of June,<br>
the first saffron leaf stands out,<br>
prophet of the fall
<p>
Mouths of ruined walls<br>
sing of cities sunk in sand...<br>
windy winding wails.
<p>
Rocks rock them to sleep<br>
stark star-pierced night covers them,<br>
knights of desert kings
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ruins in the desert seem to host a ghostly life, especially at night."</i>

There's a rattlesnake<br>
Coiled and ready to strike!<br>
Guarding its domain.
<p>The animals talk<br>
but no one wants to listen<br>
yearning to be free!

The glory of your beauty<br>
Every Autumn's day.

Heaven's dark delight.
