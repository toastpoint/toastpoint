<i>The poet comments, "Dedicated to Un-a-basho: Bad art, like bad food and bad
weather,
adds nothing to the quality of experience. Art should be judged 
by its merit, not its quantity. If art is to stand on its own then
it must have some substance. We are only free to try and make that
happen. "</i>

sweet flower of love<br>
your fragrance fills my longing<br>
petal by petal

like the river takes the leaf<br>
deeper into god

Gold drenched willow whip<br>
Drapes the sterling silver haze...<br>
Waiting for Monet.
<p>In this windwashed sky<br>
Only eagles dare to fly...<br>
Trip, then fly again.

Embattled blue gives way as<br>
Clouded sabers clash.
