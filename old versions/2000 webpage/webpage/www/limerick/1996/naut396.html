<h2>Entries from March, 1996</h2>
<h3>Justkicks writes 03/31/96</h3>
I really don't mean to intrude,<br>
Though my rhymes may sometimes be crude<br>
But today is the day<br>
That I jump in the fray<br>
So 'scuse me should my ass protrude!
<p>

A computer nerd got on the net<br>
And said "I haven't had cyber-sex yet".<br>
But she wasn't desirous<br>
She e-mailed him a virus<br>
And told him "that's all that you'll get!"
<p>
After a bottle, a bang and a bong,<br>
I sang an unsavory song.<br>
"All these pleasures" I cried<br>
"should not be denied<br>
To a man with a very long dong!"

An Indian girl in Belize<br>
Made a dildo of corncobs and cheese.<br>
She fucked it quite boldly<br>
Until it grew moldy<br>
And gave her six strange STDs!

<hr>
<h3>Menopausal writes 03/27/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
My boyfriend thinks I'm just plain mean<br>
For moaning and pleading: "Please clean!<br>
Take that trash to the dump<br>
Or no Sylvie you'll hump -<br>
Everything in the fridge has turned green!"
<p>
"And I wasn't raised in a stable!<br>
So you'll have to wear clothes at the table!<br>
Your willie's a sight<br>
Better saved for the night <br>
I've put up with as much as I'm able!
<p>
An excessively socialized bitch<br>
And a weirdo not wearing a stitch --<br>
Maybe just not a match<br>
'Twixt the caveman and snatch,<br>
Despite giving each other The Itch!!

<h3>Arthur Dent shares a classic 03/26/96</h3>
There was an old man called McTavish<br>
Who attempted an anthropod ravish,<br>
But the object of rape<br>
Was the wrong sex of ape,<br>
And the anthropod ravished McTavish!
<p>
There was a young man of Assize<br>
Whose balls were of different size.<br>
He'd look at the right<br>
With a gasp of delight,<br>
But the other brought tears to his eyes.
<p>
<i>Toast Point offers this in response:</i>
A wonderful dame of Arrizes<br>
Had breasts of two different sizes!<br>
The left one was small<br>
Hardly nothin' at all<br>
But the right one was large and won prizes!

<hr>
<h3>Anon writes 03/26/96</h3>
It seems cybersex has its attractions<br>
In lieu of more carnal distractions.<br>
But the feel of real skin<br>
Is more my kind of sin.<br>
Cybersex gives me words, but no actions.

<hr>
<h3>Max Mickser writes 03/26/96</h3>
Three girly-men, all dressed in leather<br>
Had in their asses a feather.<br>
Said the one to the other<br>
"I hope you're not my mother,<br>
Cos outside it's lovely weather!"

<hr>
<h3>D-Rick shares a classic 03/25/96</h3>
There once was a bishop from Clyde<br>
Who fell in the outhouse and died.<br>
His brother the vicar<br>
Did so but quicker, <br>
And now they're interred side by side.
<p>
The old archeologist Trostle<br>
Found a most wonderous fossil!<br>
By the way it did bend,<br>
And the knob on the end - <br>
'Twas the penis of Paul the Apostle!

And you'll find before long<br>
That you've managed to come from behind!"

<hr>
<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 03/25/96</h3>

From the world, his discovery brought cheers!<br>
From his wife, it drew nothing but tears.<br>
"For you see," said Ms. Halley,<br>
"He used to come daily,<br>
Now it's once every 76 years!"

<hr>
<h3>Big"D" writes 03/25/96</h3>
A well built young lad named Horatio<br>
Was especially fond of fellatio.<br>
He had such a schlong,<br>
Ladies called him King Dong<br>
And inflated much more than his ego!
<p>
A Republican named Robert Dole<br>
Was questioned regarding a poll.<br>
Elizabeth, when asked,<br>
Said "His pole is grotesque!"<br>
It's because of her humor so droll.

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Erections for Sue held no fears.<br>
Quothe she: "There is no cause for tears!<br>
With my lips (I have found) <br>
And my tongue wrapped around,<br>
Their rigidity soon disappears!"<br>
<p>
A buxom young lass from the West<br>
Took the following view of her chest:<br>
"They're the first things you see, <br>
So congratulate me;<br>
I will always put forward my best!"<br>

<hr>
<h3>JC writes 03/22/96</h3>
There lives a president named Bill<br>
Who fucked us all while on the hill.<br>
We thought he was strange,<br>
But his opponents are fucking deranged.<br>
What grand advertisments for the pill!

<h3>JSE (aka Rowdy Jack) writes 03/21/96</h3>

A camper with peter immense<br>
Said: "To carry a pole makes no sense!<br>
I just spread out a blanket,<br>
Crawl under and yank it.<br>
My orgasm's always in tents."
<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 03/21/96</h3>
Have you heard the word "cybersex" yet?<br>
It means having sex on the net!<br>
It's fun and exciting,<br>
Putting passions in writing,<br>
And no social disease can you get!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:daniel@luk.net>Daniel</a> writes 03/20/96</h3>
Running to a house belonging to John Maily,<br>
She went inside to visit his shlong<br>
He had his way, and something went wrong<br>
He slimed her in the eye<br>
She bit his shlong and said "goodbye"...
<p>
<i>Hmmm....sort of an upside-down limerick...</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a fellow LePew,<br>
Renowned through the land for his screw.<br>
He'd rub them with cream.<br>
Their souls would give steam.<br>
Especially that gal called 2Shoe!

We've all seen Bob Dole pull his stock up;<br>
The nomination's a lock-up.<br>
But 'tis easy to see<br>
The tired, old GOP<br>
Is just a white, male, retro cock-up!
<hr>
<h3>Thomas shares a classic 03/20/96</h3>
A lusty young man from Nantucket,<br>
Had a penis so long he could suck it.<br>
Said he with a grin<br>
As he wiped off his chin,<br>
If my ear were a cunt, I could fuck it!<br>
<p>
<i>Toast Point will do research today to see if there have been 
any months where this limerick hasn't been submitted.</i>

Pleaded Jack with Estelle, "It's not wrong!"<br>
She replied: "My convictions are strong!<br>
Only bells from a wedding<br>
Will herald our bedding!<br>
First a ring, then I'll peel for your dong."
<hr>
<h3>Lusty Gal writes 03/19/96</h3>

But what do I find?<br>
They're all the wrong kind!<br>
For this lusty gal, he needs balls!
<hr>
<h3>The Writerman's Fan Club writes 03/19/96</h3>
Oh, Writerman, don't be forlorn - <br>

She wasn't for you.<br>
So you're one, not yet two,<br>
Don't give up - raise your head, blow your horn!

<hr>
<h3>Phred shares a classic 03/18/96</h3>
Growing sore from her husband's great mass,<br>
A young bride inserted some glass.<br>
Now the prick of dear hubby<br>

And the bride can piss out her ass!

To all of those people who fell<br>
For Compuserve or AOL:<br>
Your bill is the tip-off - <br>
They're really a rip-off!<br>
They can both go to Internet Hell!
<p>
If you find a sweet thing and would hump her,<br>
Hide in the bushes and jump her!<br>
She'll respond to your form<br>
With a twat sweet and warm,<br>
And if she's ungrateful - just dump her!

<hr>
<h3>Oblivion writes 03/15/96</h3>
There once was a man name of Ender<br>
Who wanted to change from his gender.<br>
When he inquired of me,<br>
I told him that he <br>
Should stick his balls in a blender!
<p>
There once was a young man from Spain<br>
Who got his pecker stuck straight down the drain!<br>
He said with a yell,<br>
As he wiped off the gel,<br>
"I've never felt such wonderful pain!"

<h3>Mustard shares a classic 03/15/96</h3>

The color was fine,<br>
Likewise the design;<br>
The aroma, eh - <em>that</em> was a failure!

A big lad! I hope<br>
He won't mind a quick grope..."<br>
But she found that the bulge was his car keys!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Sally-Ann combines lust and aggression<br>
In each passionate sexual session.<br>
She is such a good lay<br>
That her boyfriends all say<br>
She should take it up as a profession!

The bannister broke...<br>
So he doubled his stroke...<br>
And he polished her off in mid-air!
<p>
There once was a guy from Wheeling.<br>
Who played with his dick with great feeling.<br>
And then like a trout...<br>
He'd stick his mouth out...<br>
And catch the drops from the ceiling!

Writerman's jaw hit the floor!<br>
He knew that he's not been a boor;<br>
But the twit, in a snit<br>
Pitched a fit, packed her clit<br>
And her twat and suchlike out the door!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Forget her, forget her, forget her!<br>
You can do, oh, so much better!<br>
Now, dear, though 'twas a shock,<br>
Time to perk up your cock<br>
And plug a more sane Internetter!

<h3>jimbob writes 03/13/96</h3>
Bill Clinton says "I love Hollywood!<br>
I've helped all the stars that I could!<br>
So let's have a big hand<br>
For Chief Justice Streisand<br>
Who, by the way, gives head real good!"

<hr>
<h3>Mr. McThin writes...</h3>
There once was a man from the cape<br>
Whose fly was always agape;<br>
He walked along the dunes<br>
Singing some tunes,<br>
Letting his flatulence escape.

<p>
<h3>and shares a classic 03/12/96</h3>
Their once was a man named Dave<br>
Who dug an old whore up from the grave,<br>
She was smelly as shit<br>

But think of the bucks that he saved!

<h3>WRITERMAN's back(!) and wiser in love 3/12/96</h3>
Said old Writerman with a smile,<br>
"I haven't been here in a while!<br>
I've missed the tongue slashings,<br>
The trashing and bashings,<br>
And all of the verbiage most vile!"
<p>
Just give this poet a chance<br>
And he'll detail his latest romance!<br>
We met on the net<br>
So you all know the set...<br>
It's like deja vu in advance!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A romance that we built out of Lego<br>
Me, Miami and she, San Diego<br>
Didn't matter to me<br>
Seemed a match meant to be<br>
Like vermicelli and Prego!
<p>
Every night we both stoked the fires,<br>
Burning oil and telephone wires - <br>
Her voice, her refrain <br>
I craved like cocaine;<br>
All doomsayers put down as liars!
<p>
From San Diego she came,<br>
Writerman's Internet Flame!<br>
The past has passed -<br>
Together at last!<br>
Kathy's the young lady's name!
<p>
I had wondered just how could I get<br>
Hooked on someone whom I'd never met!<br>
Doesn't work - now I know, sir -<br>
I'll choose one that lives closer<br>
Lest when she comes - she comes on a jet!
<p>
Though we'd sworn our love for always,<br>
She was out of here in two days!<br>
This "gentleman" sucker,<br>
He never did fuck her -<br>
Fuck her and maybe she stays!
<p>
Though she didn't quite ring my bell,<br>
The thing seemed to be going quite well,<br>
But when cybermate Kathy<br>
Got too pschopathy,<br>
Turned into the romance from hell!
<p>
<i>Details, Og!  We all want to know!</i>

<h3>Gumby shares a classic 03/11/96</h3>
There was a young girl from McGill,<br>
Tried a dynamite stick for a thrill,<br>
They found her vagina 
In North Carolina<br>
And bits of her tits in Brazil!<p>
<i>Brazil, McGill, it's all the same...</i>
<hr>
<h3>Poopy writes 03/11/96</h3>
Love on the rocks<br>
What a disgrace<br>
Give your mom a nickel<br>
And she'll put in your pickle<br>
And might even sit on your face!
<p>
<i>Love on the rocks?</i>
<hr>
<h3>DaHomer writes 03/11/96</h3>
Toast Point, I gladly welcome you back!<br>
We've missed you and this page, that's a fact!<br>
The lewd and crude verse,<br>
Perverted and terse,<br>
Helps to keep my sanity intact!
<p>
<i>Toast Point replies:</i><br>
Da Homer, you're really too kind,<br>
But a niche I've created, I find...<br>
Consider it my duty<br>
To support what is lewdy<br>
And grist for a true dirty mind!
<hr>
<h3>CB writes 03/08/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Candidate Buchanan assumes<br>
An electorate drawn from barrooms.<br>
He's really a clown<br>
And his shirt is as brown<br>
As the tracks in his Fruit-of-the-Looms.

<hr>
<h3>Stan the Man writes 03/08/96</h3>
Ginger, come sit on my face!<br>
I won't get my nose out of place!<br>
It's pointed and long,<br>
And shaped like a schlong,<br>
And can move at a very quick pace!
<p>
<i>Yay, they're back!</i>
<hr>
<h3>Van writes 03/07/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There was a young lad from San 'Frisco<br>
Who picked up a man in a disco.<br>
When home in bed,<br>
In wonder, he said,<br>
"You want to do WHAT with that Crisco?!?"
<p>
A well-written limerick is lewd,<br>
Vile, disgusting and crude.<br>
If you find it hard<br>
To play the bard,<br>
Try writing while in the nude!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Lady Di has the Windsors in states,<br>
For they always <em>put up</em> with their mates.<br>
In fact, young Queen Lizzie<br>
Made her Phillip quite dizzy,<br>
Saying "The hole of England awaits!"

Observing the bulge in his khakis<br>
And being a bit of a cocktease,<br>
I fondled his crotch<br>
While he stood and watched,<br>
Till he blew a big wad in his jockeys!

Hamlet's pal was performing fellatio<br>
And was stunned by his width-to-length ratio.<br>
Quoth the Dane, "I've more girth<br>
Under heaven or earth<br>
Than you've ever dreamt of, Horatio!"

<hr>
<h3>Wiseacre shares a classic 03/02/96</h3>
There once was a young man named Skinner<br>
Who invited a fair lass to dinner.<br>
At a quarter to nine they sat down to dine;<br>
At a quarter to ten it was in her. <br>
(The dinner was in her, not Skinner;<br>
Skinner was in her before dinner!)

The Hardy Boys, on an adventure<br>
Encountered a willing young wench.  Her<br>
Lust they aroused<br>
But they stuck to their vows<br>
To rely on each other for pleasure.

There once was a man from Peru<br>
Who liked to make love with his shoe!<br>
He said with a hoot<br>
(as he came in his boot),<br>
"Tomorrow, I'll try a size 2!"
