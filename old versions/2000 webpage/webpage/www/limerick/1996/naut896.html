<h3>3Dan shares a classic 08/31/96</h3>
There once was a girl named Dot<br>
Who liked to eat boogers and snot<br>
When she couldn't get these<br>
She ate the green cheese<br>
That grew in the folds of her twat!

<i>Eeeewwwww....</i>

<h3>The Goof writes 08/30/96</h3>
Hi, Sage, I've returned!<br>
Many a midnight oil I've burned<br>
  Fornicating and fucking,<br>
  Masturbating and sucking, <br>
Gonorrhea, I've thus earned...
<p>
<i>Ah, the gift that keeps on giving...</i>
<p>
The Web just has boundless erotica!<br>
From sites in Australia to America<br>
       Be it a .com or a .edu,<br>
       It fills my brains with goo<br>
When I see images of Cindy, Angie and Erica!

<hr>
<h3>Jack DeLadd shares a classic 08/29/96</h3>

He shrieked with delight<br>
As he ploughed through her shite<br>
And filled up her hole with his jelly!

The judicial sage from Toast Point<br>
A poet he craved to anoint-<br>
With a urinous bliss<br>
He fermented the piss<br>
And rubbed it all over his joint!

The sage is disconcerted and will ponder whether forgiveness is deserved.</i>

The Hardy Boys, on an adventure,<br>
Needed to cash in a debenture.<br>

For spying all nude<br>
And for beating their meat without censure!

<p>
"You, choirboy!" ordered the pastor<br>
"On your knees, I am your master!"<br>

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Don't munch this rug!"</i>

<h3>Sucha Nice Boy shares classics 08/18/96</h3>
There was a young farmer from Kitts<br>
Who planted an acre of tits.<br>
When they ripened in fall,<br>
Pink nipples and all,<br>
He greedily chewed them to bits!

There was a man of Rangoon<br>
Whose father came off too soon.<br>
Not having the luck<br>
To be born from a fuck,<br>
He was scraped off the sheet with a spoon.
<p>
There was a young man from Bombay<br>
Who fashioned a cunt out of clay,<br>
But the heat of his prick<br>
Baked the clay into brick<br>
And abraded his foreskin away.

Whose balls were made out of brass.<br>
In stormy weather,<br>
They clashed together,<br>
And sparks flew out from his ass.

To suck a Mongol, I must, <br>
But my fantasy butts are Iraquis!"

There was found in a small, English town,<br>
A whore that was big, fat, and round.<br>
Men paid more to abuse 'er,<br>
To fuck and to use her - <br>
Foreign England, they pay by the pound!

<h3>and shares a classic 08/18/96</h3>
The Kleenex is brought to his nose.<br>
He inhales and then sharply blows.<br>
The Kleenex, it shattered.<br>
The boogers are splattered<br>
All over the front of his clothes!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I've always considered this oddly paced poem one of the best non-sexual, 
but crude, limericks I've ever heard.  My cousin wrote it for an 8th grade
English class assignment of a "limerick that wasn't dirty."  
The content is pure 13 year-old and the bending of the verb tense from 
present to past makes it particularly appealing to me. Best of all, he 
received a day's detention for his efforts."</i>

<h3>Rhubarb shares a classic by Cybergeezer 08/17/96</h3>
There was an old hermit named Dave<br>

The lesbian clan<br>
Massaged her with flan<br>
And consumed it by light of the moon...ahh.

There once was a nun from Altoona<br>

Said the priest who was weary<br>
From strokin' his 'dearie',<br>
"Oh sister let me lick yer lacuna !

A librarian, checking her stacks,<br>
Decided to unzip her slacks!<br>
Her pussy was wet,<br>

<h3>Sandman writes 08/13/96</h3>
A young maiden entered the water in bits<br>
'Twas cold as she shivered in fits<br>

While the tide lapped up round her knees...

Madonna, you know, is with child<br>
The bishop, he just went wild<br>
"If I find the bloke<br>
who gave her pussy a poke<br>
I will declare him ecclesiastically reviled!"

There once was a waitress named Janna<br>
Who jerked sodas in Great Falls, Montana.<br>
But the cowboys took notice<br>

And had a split better than banana!

<h3>Arp shares classics 08/07/96</h3>

<h3>Bawdy Bard writes 08/07/96</h3>
Her husband Tom is an old "pussy taster,"<br>

Much more than high hell<br>
So she now uses a large turkey baster.

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
In life there are may pitfalls - <br>
I'll speak of one which greatly appalls...<br>
I think it unjust<br>
That in moments of lust<br>
I'm unable to lick my own balls!
<p>
At the crest of evolution we stand,<br>
Yet there's some things we can't do on demand - <br>
We can't tongue our own jewels,<br>
But note, we're not fools,<br>
For we've young ladies to give us a hand!

<h3>Sandman writes 08/07/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Forthcoming is a strange Christmas tale<br>
About Santa who wound up in jail<br>
The problem you see<br>
As plain as could be<br>
Was his penchant for the wee amber ale
<p>
You see on a night when the beer was for free<br>
He came home as drunk as could be,<br>
And the silly old codger<br>
Wound the clock with his todger<br>
And buggered his wife with the key!
<p>
She's now suing for unlawful entry;<br>
Her home now guarded by alarm and by sentry.<br>
Not welcome at home<br>
So now he does roam<br>
No longer a popular old gentry.
<p>
He hit on on a new line of work<br>
And around a dentist he happened to lurk<br>
But with increasing depravity<br>
He'd fill the wrong cavity<br>
Now all the women do think Santa's a jerk!
<p>
Suddenly Santa took moment to pause<br>
As James Dean waltzed on through the doors<br>
He arrested him quick<br>
It's the end of St. Nick<br>
Now we've a rebel....without a Claus!
<p>
<I>Hee hee.  Sandman, did you write this?  It wasn't clear from the submission.  Toast Point gives you the benefit of the doubt.</I>
<p>

<h3>Sandman replies 08/07/96</h3>
Those last limericks were in fact mine - <br>
Sandman hopes you thought they were fine.<br>
My life is a rhyme,<br>
Yet strangely sublime - <br>
I'll make sure I sign each line that is mine!

There was a young lass at the lake<br>
With nipples so nifty they'd make<br>
The most adequate swimwear<br>
A reason for mens' stare<br>
And boggle their minds 'til they'd break!

There once was a girl from Bengal<br>
Who went to a masquerade ball.<br>
Her dress caught on fire<br>
And burnt her entire<br>
Front page, sporting section and all!

<i>The submitter comments, "Heard this one about 45 years ago in Grade 6.
Not repeatable then but squeaky-clean today at any age."

I once knew a girl with some class - <br>
She only at grapes in a glass.<br>
If the grapes were too tart,<br>
She'd then start to fart,<br>
And grape seeds would shoot out her ass!
