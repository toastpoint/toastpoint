There was a strange man from Zabat<br>

Several sizes that day,<br>
Just like that heart of the Grinch's!

<i>Somebody gave me two starting lines and challenged me to
finish the limerick - so here's what I came up with...</i>
<p>
There once was a soldier named Art - <br>
Every time he ate Spam, he would fart! <br>
It's a hell of a feat <br>
For a tin of chopped meat <br>
To have such effect on one's Pvt. parts. 

<p>
There once was a soldier named Art - <br>
Every time he ate Spam, he would fart! <br>
With the help of this fact, <br>
And a strategical match, <br>
He could blow all the bad guys apart! <br>
<p>

There once was a soldier named Art -<br>
Every time he ate Spam, he would fart! <br>
Such a sweet melody <br>
That all did agree <br>
That his arse must connect to his heart!

There once was a girl from Lynn Mass,<br>
Who had a magnificent ass.<br>
Not rounded and pink,<br>
As you probably think,<br>
It's gray, has long ears, and eats grass!
<p>
Then Jill, who was very perceptive,<br>
Because she was so disrespected, <br>
Didn't ever say yes,<br>
Never cleaned up the mess,<br>
Unless <em>he</em> would use contraceptive!

<i>Toast Point informs DOMIN8R that the Sage has banned the 
"Man from Nantucket" limerick, even if changed to "man with a bucket".</i>

The cows would look on,<br>
And it made the bull horny, they say!

The young heifers he wanted to dink;<br>

Get someone else to do all the jerkin'!

Said a frowzy French maid named Louise,<br>

<i>The writer comments: This is a limerick, alas, that requires explanation. What¹s more, it¹s in two languages.

I appeared in a community theater production of Noel Coward¹s Private Lives, a comedy with four principal roles (two feuding married couples who switch partners) and a bit part for a French maid named Louise (me). Louise speaks nothing but French and appears only briefly to discover the four principal characters apparently shacked up together. 

At the opening night cast part, I recited this limerick, French accent and all!

A man's desire to fuck<br>
Is a game of considerable luck<br>
The promises he makes<br>
And the interest he fakes<br>
In the name of hormones run amok.

A woman's desire to be loved<br>
By a strong man lying above<br>
Is tempered by reason<br>
And a strong sense of season<br>
When her lover's pecker is ungloved
