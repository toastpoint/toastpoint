<h3><a href=mailto:richrich@interpac.net>Martin Oliver</a> writes 04/30/96</h3>
Once dead, she enjoyed the house that he built her.<br>
We knew that she did it, but couldn't quite guilt her.<br>
She lived to be eighty, then passed from the scene.<br>
We returned to the site and captured a gene.<br>
From that DNA, we rebuilt her, tried her and killt her!

<h3>Ms. Nobody writes 04/30/96</h3>
There once was a fellow named Vern<br>
Whose cigarette he would not dare burn.<br>
If he did, he would choke<br>
From all of the smoke<br>
And fall on the floor like a worm!

A principled man is he<br>
Who knows his priority<br>
If it's the right season<br>
Regardless of reason<br>
Leaves early to hit the first tee!

There once was a man named Patel<br>
Who managed a cozy hotel.<br>
One day, in a hurry,<br>
He slipped on some curry,<br>
And now he's a human pretzel!
<p>
<i>Pret-ZEL?</i>

Habia un hombre de Argentina<br>
Que tenia una esposa llamada Nina<br>
Un dia ella regreso a casa<br>
Y parecia loca porque estaba borracha<br>
Entonces juntos tomaron la cerveza mas fina!

Is Netscape the ultimate browser?<br>
Are there two legs in every trouser?<br>
Nothing can compare<br>
With a browser so rare<br>
So believe me, or go ask Doc. Howser!

He just wanted to know if I was going his way.

When my dog and I walk at night,<br>
Looking up's a beautiful sight;<br>
I stop and stare,<br>
She doesn't care,<br>
Dogs are not wowed by star light.  <br>
(But they sure are bow-wowed in moonlight!)

I told you just what I wanted<br>
And I knew that you knew what I wanted<br>
So, if I knew that you knew<br>
And that you knew that I knew<br>
Then I knew that you knew that I knew that you knew what I wanted...
<p>
<i>OK...</i>

A canner, exceedlingly canny,<br>
One morning remarked to his granny.<br>
"A canner can can<br>
Anything that he can.<br>
But, a canner can't can a can, can he?"

There once was a pilot in flight<br>
Who daringly dashed out of sight.<br>
He hit passing gear<br>
And his front met his rear.<br>
Now he travels more quickly than light!

Whose tummy was more than too full.<br>
He ate a whole sheep<br>

"Oh, I should have sheared off that wool!"

Jo Ellen once rode on a horse<br>
That turned her away from her course.<br>
It trotted so far<br>
She did not know whar<br>
She was, and was filled with remorse.
<p>
Lucy once said she like flowers,<br>
And would smell them and pet them for hours.<br>
She climbed up a tree,<br>
Some blossoms to see.<br>
And was readily caught in its bowers.

And it's easy to tell<br>
There's too many nitrates per gram!

<h3><a href=mailto:lugos@psc.state.fl.us>Slugo</a> writes 04/26/96</h3>
In my office the lights will go nil<br>
By themselves if you're quiet or still - <br>

My arms I keep jerking<br>
An unwanted perk! What a thrill!

Who got up and started to dance<br>
Such a very strange sight -<br>
People fainted from fright<br>
And he left them in a strange trance!
<p>
There once was a yak from Bhutan<br>
Who collected old soda cans<br>
His collection got large<br>
So he loaded a barge<br>
And shoved the large barge off dry land.

<p>
<h3>and 'Legend of the Red Dragon' inspired</h3>
There once was a man from a field<br>
Who carried a sword and a shield.<br>
He fought evil all day<br>
And kept monsters at bay<br>
And to him all villians did yield.

Our Master of Arts was a wreck;<br>

While rhyming is fine,<br>
The job offers, I find<br>
Go to fellows who studied hi-tech!

<h3>Animale shares classics 04/24/96</h3>
I wish that my room had a floor,<br>
I don't care so much for a door,<br>
But this walking around<br>
Without touching the ground<br>
Is getting to be quite a bore!
<p>
There once was a young girl from Woosesster<br>

<h3>Pat shares a classic 04/23/96</h3>
There once was a fellow named Dan<br>
Whose limericks never would scan.<br>
When asked the reason why,<br>
He gave this reply:<br>
"I suppose it's because I always try to fit into the last line as many words as I possibly, possibly can!

<h3><a href=mailto:davi@aimnet.com>MadCat</a> writes 04/22/96</h3>
Of love there is little to speak<br>
That some hormone's not able to tweak;<br>
To cast a chemical spell<br>
With some scent you can't smell<br>
So you'll find those you don't really seek.
<p>
There once was a geek who would growl<br>
That love was, at best, the most foul - <br>
‘Til he bit off the head<br>
Of a chicken, in bed,<br>
And fell in love with a saucer-eyed owl!

<hr>
<h3>Julia writes 04/19/96</h3>
My husband's glued to the screen!<br>
My computer, overtaken has been!<br>
He says he's not hooked,<br>
But if I'm not mistooked,<br>
His protest is just a smoke-screen.

My tennis nemesis Pat<br>
Wields her racquet more like a bat!<br>
The ball sails by<br>
And she wonders why<br>
I don't have time for a chat!

<hr>
<h3>Quilis shares a classic 04/18/96</h3>
Each night, Grandpa fills me with dread <br>
As he sits on the edge of my bed;<br>
I don't mind that he speaks<br>
In blood-curdling shrieks,<br>
But for twenty-five years he's been dead!

Mrs. Browning went to the zoo;<br>
Her class went with her, too.<br>
They stayed there for AGES!<br>
Locked up in cages--<br>
Come see the exhibit - it's new!

<h3>Anonymous writes 04/17/96</h3>
I can't quite recall or remember<br>
Where I was yet last November.<br>
I must have been on one strange trip<br>
When I saw the weirdest ship<br>
It flew by my head, left - it's hum- linger.

A man died while eating, in Sydney,<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:magicowmyn@aol.com>Bonnie B.</a> writes 04/08/96</h3>
There was a young man from Lake Erie,<br>
Who felt that his life was quite dreary,<br>
He'd three kids and a spouse,<br>
A big yellow house,<br>
And debts that left him quite teary.

<hr>
<h3>Mydway Myn shares a classic 04/08/96</h3>
I just perused Bonnie's rhymed curse -<br>
It seems she's upset by the verse.<br>
Thinks the form's been perverted<br>
And fun limericks averted. . . .<br>
"Sez who?" is my reply, terse.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:magicwomyn@aol.com>Bonnie B.</a> writes 04/08/96</h3>
Victoria said, "Oh my!"<br>
Eric's web page you must try,<br>
So I paid it a visit,<br>
And asked what is it?<br>
Then quickly said my good-bye.
<p>
At limericks I am quite green,<br>
But found these particularly mean,<br>
They ragged on each other,<br>
Their father and mother,<br>
And most were more than obscene.
<p>
Limericks, when all's said and done,<br>
Clean or dirty, are supposed to be fun,<br>
Not personal disses,<br>
That elicit hisses,<br>
Making newbies turn and run.

A barber who hailed from Connecticut<br>
Had a terrible problem in etiquette:<br>
To each patron he'd coo,<br>
"Why hello, there!  It's you!"<br>
For he'd never remember whose head he cut.

<h3>Art Hur  writes 04/02/96</h3>
There was an alien from outer space<br>
Who came to join the human race<br>
It searched the scenery <br>
For the greenery<br>
But of it, it found no trace!
