<h3>AlabamaArse shares a classic 07/31/96</h3>
Mary had a little lamb,<br>
She kept it in a bucket<br>
And every time the lamb got out,<br>
The dog would try to...<br>
Put it back in!
<p>
<I>Al comments, "Not quite a limerick...got it on a tour bus in the parking lot of the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. I typed it exactly how it was told...with the exception of the last line..."</I>

There once was a girl named Ludmilla,<br>
Who had an affair with a driller.<br>
Ah,the sight of his oil,<br>
It would make her blood boil,<br>
For 'twas only his bit could fulfill her!
<hr>
<h3>Old Goatie shares a classic 07/30/96</h3>
An aspiring poet named Glass<br>
Had balls that were made out of brass.<br>
When they tinkled together,<br>
They played "Stormy Weather"<br>
And lightning shot out his ass!

Eating Spam on the porch in the nude<br>
Was a habit the neighbors thought lewd,<br>
But when he donned clothing<br>
They didn't stop loathing - <br>
'Twas the sight of the Spam they eschewed!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:daenan@aol.com>Daenan</a> shares a classic 07/29/96</h3>
A near-sighted golfer named Leer<br>
Was thrown off the links just last year<br>
For being obscene<br>
Right on the first green<br>
'Neath a sign that read "Enter Course Here"!

This Olympics spectator applauds<br>
U.S. Broadjumping champion, Bill Bauds<br>
The event's quite demanding<br>
Yet his record's still standing<br>
He jumped over 2,000 broads!
<p>
<I>Toast Point notes: "Og, I saw this before and <u>thought</u> I put it in.  My apologies"</I>

<h3><a href=mailto:ncglass@northernnet.com>N. C. Glass</a> writes 07/28/96</h3>
An amorous girl from Champaign<br>
Took on a young husband to train.<br>
Her joy knew no bounds,<br>
Though she lost several pounds<br>
For his hungers were just as profane!
<p>
<I>The poet's wedding gift for his wife...</I>

<hr>
<h3>His Peace writes 07/26/96</h3>
Ever noticed how folks down South<br>
Always talk with food in their mouth?<br>
One day they will find<br>
That their beloved behind<br>
Can too, and then they'll pass out!!
<p>
I knew a guy who loved to bungee jump - <br>
He once jumped off a camel's hump.<br>
But the cord didn't hold fast<br>
And that jump indeed was his last,<br>
'Cos he crashed in a heap of camel dump!

<hr>
<h3>Herkin writes 07/26/96</h3>
Today the world's focus is on Atlanta!<br>
But the new events causing all the banter<br>
Are the Long-Distance Spit<br>
And the Vertical Shit.<br>
I bet the Yanks will win these in a canter!!

<hr>
<h3>Chrisadam writes 07/25/96</h3>
There once was a man named Ted.<br>
His dick was bigger than his head.<br>
He coulden't fit it up<br>
A pussy or a butt<br>
So he used his head instead!

There once was a girl from Temecula<br>

Whose skills 'tween the sheets were spectacula.<br>

Men came far and wide<br>

But oh! what a ride...<br>

It left them like they was tubercula!

Madonna, you know, is with child<br>

And it's got theologians quite riled<br>

That her increase in girth<br>

May be called "Virgin Birth"<br>

Though her trainer's been fucking her wild!

Poor Sandman, you feel like a misfit,<br>
But here's an answer, if you're willing to risk it - <br>
My dog licks his cock<br>
'Till it's hard like a rock<br>
And you can too - just give him a biscuit!<p>
A gay young pixie called Paul<br>
Was grinning like a damn fool.<br>
When I asked him why<br>
He winked and replied<br>
I'm sitting on a toadstool!<p>
<i>
Could there be an apostrophe missing in the last word?</i>
<p>
"Marathon Sucking" would attract a large throng<br>
But one problem means the event won't be on<br>
You may search there and here<br>
But I really do fear<br>
You won't find a dick twenty-six miles long!<p>
<i>
If you do, let us know...</i>

When the pols are illicitly boffin'<br>
'Til their poles and their poll numbers soften,<br>
Perhaps we can vote<br>
(In reverse of <a href=#tim>
Tim's quote</a>)<br>
That their "standings are rising" too often!<hr>
<h3>Queentut writes 07/19/96</h3>
There once was a man from Bel Isle<br>
Who knew all the women would smile<br>
When he opened his coat - <br>
IT'S THE SIZE OF A BOAT! - <br>
He'd a shit-eating grin all the while.<hr>

The Olympic Games are a bore.<br>
Without SEX events they're a snore!<br>
Let's have "Cross-Country Fucking!"<br>
And "Marathon Sucking!"<br>
Isn't THAT what our bodies are for?<p>
<i>
Yay, Og's back!</i>

<h3>query writes 07/17/96</h3>
There once was a girl from Nantucket<br>
Who sat on a bench on her tuffet - <br>
She became a big bore,<br>
Her tuffet became sore,<br>
And all the townspeople said, "Stuff it!"<hr>
<h3>CeeJay writes 07/17/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Poor Sandman feels misunderstood,<br>
He thinks a dog's life must be good.<br>
He'd enjoy the sensation<br>
Of auto-fellation....<br>
I'm sure we all would if we could!<hr>
<h3>Coxwell writes 07/16/96</h3>
John was rough when he fucked it - <br>
He grabbed his wife's hair as she sucked it<br>
    Lorraine said, "Let go!"<br>
    He replied, "Just blow."<br>
So she bit the shit off and chucked it!<hr>

Sandman</a> writes 07/15/96</h3>
A final thought as I stare at the sky,<br>
Pondering, as life slowly passes me by,<br>
What is to me<br>
The greatest mystery<br>
If dogs can lick their genitals,why can't I?<hr>
<h3>Stargazer writes 07/12/96</h3>

U.S. "tories" are surely in luck; up<br>
To now, mostly Democrats fuck up.<br>
JFK, Hart, and Clinton<br>
Have dropped us the hint on<br>
What LIBERAL "members" get stuck up.<hr>
<i>
The Sage informs Spinach Head that the "man from Nantucket" limerick has been banned from the Toast Point Contest, due to oversubmission.</i>

The Conservatives' standings aren't rising <br>
A fact that is hardly surprising <br>
As each week in bed,<br>
Another member's found dead <br>
In a position that's quite compromising! <p>
The fires of scandal become embers <br>
And the party tries not to remember <br>
How awful the sleaze <br>
With poor Sarah Keyes <br>
And a stuck-up Conservative member.<p>
<i>
The poet comments, "I say, more British politilimericks. Naughty ol' Cecil P.went and got his secretary preggers, don't you know. "  The Sage is appalled by such naughty behavior.</i>

Seems "naughty" is down on its luck;<br>
All its poets have chosen to duck.<br>
So I'll write, out of pity,<br>
This sweet little ditty ---<br>
Which is too clean to be here!  Oh, fuck.<p>
<i>
Ahh.....that's better........</i>

There was a young girl named Jen<br>
Whose body was rated a "10".<br>
But the guy she was dating<br>
Had questioned the rating<br>
And he never was heard from again!<hr>

The far out city of LA<br>
Held an ugly girl contest one day.<br>
When the winner stripped down,<br>
Most men turned around - <br>
But those who dared stare all turned gay!</b>
