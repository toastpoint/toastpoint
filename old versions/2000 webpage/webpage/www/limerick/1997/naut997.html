When we necked, I thought, "My, how she's sweating."<br>
But her warmth and her zeal were offsetting.<br>
Then, at the splashdown<br>
It was then that I found<br>
That she had a big problem: bedwetting!

Why is that whip in your closet?<br>
Wanting a penile deposit?<br>
I admit it'd be nice,<br>
Cause my pecker's like ice!<br>
A good whipping usually thaws it!

There once was a man from Nantucket<br>
Whose hiney got stuck in a bucket<br>
To blast it apart<br>
He let out a fart<br>
But three people were too late to duck it!

While receiving some great oral sex<br>
I take sips from a bottle of Becks<br>
And while lost in a daze then<br>
I remember the days when<br>
The sex was as good as the Becks!

<h4>Queen of the Jungle</h4>
In the heart of the jungle lived Ryan<br>
The world's one and only GAY lion<br>
The prospect of his service<br>
Did render most nervous<br>
Each male animal he had his eye on!

And watched them fall<br>
Because they were all forsakon.

Wore navel- and eyebrow- and ear-things.<br>
During sex they would squeak<br>
With a rhythm, and peak<br>
At the same time as you and the bedsprings!

I'm bathing in oil - care to join me?<br>
It helps cure this spot on my loin, see?<br>
It's my social life's ruin:<br>
This spot got from screwin'<br>
The wrong orifice in a donkey!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Very tough one."</i>
<p>
I hear that your "thing" is tremendous<br>
Of a magnitude that just might send us<br>
O'er a sexual cliff-<br>
But only if stiff!<br>
If it's soft - from such fates, please defend us!

Said the leatherman to his admirer - <br>
A young boy who sang in the choir -<br>
"The church we attend<br>
Had my soul on the mend,<br>
But my afterlife now looks much direr!"
<p>
I want something new for my pleasure<br>
I could collect coins, or hunt treasure;<br>
There's football, and dance,<br>
Origami, and stamps...<br>
Hey, this lim'rick's too clean by a measure!

He said that he hated the Queen.<br>
He included the word, "Vaseline."<br>
The word was not "duck,"<br>
And nor was it "pluck."<br>
The word that he used was obscene!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This was almost clean. "</i>
<p>
I'll admit, dammit, I was self-taught;<br>
And I never could tie a square knot.<br>
I get lost when downtown,<br>
And I drive 'round and 'round;<br>
And I never could find the G-spot.

<h3>Oddo Von Schlong writes 09/26/97</h3>
Where the hell are the limericks I made<br>
I fear they did not make the grade<br>
Submit them I did<br>
Like a giggling kid<br>
Of rejection I think I'm afraid

Cold comfort but cheap at the price."

Why is that whip in your closet?<br>
A new sexual bridge! Shall I cross it?<br>

A very odd gent name of Crockett<br>
Stuck his erection into a light socket.<br>
He'd riccochet off the walls,<br>
And set fire to his balls,<br>
But it would make him come like a rocket!

<h3>Lick-er-itch writes 09/25/97</h3>
There once was a man named Jack<br>
He could pack a whole lot in his sack<br>
 One day in bed with a fat whore<br>
Jack found himself on the floor<br>
And ended up fucking the door.

<h3>Oddo Von Schlong writes 09/25/97</h3>
A one-eyed old whore named Lou<br>
Claimed there's nothing that she wouldn't do<br>
She popped out her eye<br>
While she pleasured some guy<br>
Saying "Come back! I'll keep an eye out for you!"
<p>
A lady with multiple piercings<br>
Denying she leaked rather fiercely<br>
Checked all of her holes <br>
And even some moles<br>
Her contentions thereby endorsing.

Why is that whip in your closet?<br>
My suspicions it does surely posit<br>
Preferred is black leather<br>
But i'd like to know whether<br>
The tip is single or really composite

<i>The poet comments, "Cat 'o nine tails anyone?"</i>
<p>
Said the leatherman to his admirer<br>
My last partner I had to fire her<br>
I asked "take off your hood"<br>
but it did me no good<br>
for I found I could no longer desire her!
<p>
A man that we'll call Bob Little<br>
Whose wife's pussy he did love to diddle<br>
Declared with a screech<br>
"It used to look like a peach<br>
But became a cowpie with a track up the middle!

I hear that your "thing" is tremendous<br>

With our ass in the air<br>
To receive the "bolognus stupendous"!

I want something new for my pleasure<br>
36 "D" at least they should measure<br>
Pert and pretty they'd stand<br>
And conform to my hand<br>
No "sunken chest" for this pirate's treasure!

<i>The poet comments, "Yarrgggh Matey!"</i>
<p>
I'm bathing in oil - care to join me?<br>
While I'm slippery, greasy and oily<br>
I could slide 'cross the floor<br>
Maybe right out the door<br>
But for God's sake just don't try to boil me!<hr>

They say it's according to Hoyle:<br>
Before you should dipstick her oil,<br>
It's OK to tease,<br>
But remember disease,<br>
And be sure to wrap it in foil!

<i>The poet comments, "Ouch!"</i>

<h3>HOKE shares a classic 09/24/97</h3>
There was a young lady from St. Paul<br>
Who wore a newspaper dress to a ball<br>
The dress caught fire<br>
And burned her entire<br>
Front page, Sporting section and all!

<hr><h3>The Convivial Codfish writes 09/24/97</h3>
There was an old god named Thor<br>
Who left all the maidens sore.<br>
But when he met Sif,<br>
He took her to wif,<br>
And now he gets it no more!
<p>
Now I lay me down to masturbate--<br>
I pray you let me elaborate:<br>
I lick and I stroke,<br>
I prod and I poke,<br>
Just like ev'ry girl without a mate.

Well-groomed Wanda betook her the trouble<br>

A charming young girl called Felicity,<br>
Is renowned for her twat's elasticity. <br>
Both the thick and the slim<br>
Fit her capable quim.<br>
A remarkable feat of duplicity!
<p>
A gallant young cocksman called Nick<br>
Is known for his prehensile prick. <br>
He'll take the thing out,<br>
And wave it about<br>
Without using his hands... What a trick!

With a note to explain<br>
That it came from his grandmothers arsehole!

<h3>No-no shares a classic 09/22/97</h3>
A smattering of applause could be heard,<br>
When the carney ate the fresh turd.<br>
And to keep from choking,<br>
While his dick he was stroking,<br>
He drank urine, shaken, not stirred!

A lesbian, Ellen DeGeneris<br>
If not for publicity would surely be penniless<br>

<h3>Yesterday writes 09/22/97</h3>
My vibrator's battery's dying!<br>
My husband used it too much last night.<br>
I told him to save some for me<br>
But he just didn't listen<br>
So I told him to find another man.

<h3>ODDO VON SCHLONG writes 09/22/97</h3>
While the end of the month draws near<br>
I sit here scratching my rear<br>
For a phrase just to "turn"<br>
Or a concept to spurn<br>
I'll forget which finger that was, is my fear!
<p>
In a lather all slippery and thick<br>
Earnestly 'trimming my wick'<br>
In a slurry of foam<br>
When there's nobody home<br>
No one cares cares how fast I wash my dick!

<h3><a href=mailto:Skink2@juno.com>John Chastaine</a> writes 09/21/97</h3>

I keep showing my owner.<br>
How to treat my boner,<br>
But he'd rather just sit there and watch!"

"So tell us, does size really matter?"<br>
Said the bride to her seamstress and hatter.<br>

You'd have to have faith;<br>
But a seven will make you much gladder!"

Ten wrong numbers and he's really sick<br>
The next caller would get quite a trick<br>
When it rings he says "Hi"<br>
"May I please speak with Vi?"<br>
"She can't talk, in her mouth is my dick."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The idea was from Danny DaVito in the movie "Ruthless People."  He just loves wrong numbers so he can say something obscene to the caller."</i>

There once was a boy from New Brunswick<br>

When too small was her yummy<br>
He'd go in through her tummy---<br>
Creating the world-famous "Caesarian!"

Farewell, Sagittarius,<br>
You fairy nefarious!"<br>

A woman whose spouse was untrue<br>
Came home long before she was due.<br>
Lingerie on the rug,<br>
Which for her was too snug<br>
For herself, finally gave her a clue.<br>

Then truthfully said<br>
That he died from a slip on the floor.<br>

There was a sick seal named Miss Rose<br>
