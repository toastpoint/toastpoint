While transacting at the local bank<br>
With a gun, my heart quickly sank,<br>
For when I returned to the lot<br>
With the funds that I got,<br>
I discovered no gas in the tank.

<h3>Blue Paine shares a classic 04/30/98</h3>
A young man of King David's line<br>
Changed water into the best wine<br>
He said with a grin<br>
As he wiped off his chin,<br>
"The glory's my father's, not mine!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A poet friend told me there was a Christian 
limerick contest and solicited an entry.  Then he wouldn't use it 
(something about fearing for his life).  I hate to see it lie fallow, so  . . . 
here it is!"</i>
<p>
<i>We like it!</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:niatras1@webtv.net>Ron Sartain</a> writes 04/29/98</h3>
There once was a preacher named Purvis,<br>
Who made all the church members nervous,<br>
For the sign at the door,<br>
They couldn't ignore,<br>
"No shirt, no shoes, no service."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "My first limerick submission anywhere!"</i>
<p>
<i>Oo!</i>

"Saippuakivikauppias," said Jack,<br>
"A Finn palindrome, front to back!"<br>
Said I, "that's a scary one<br>
Here's some Hungarian:<br>
Kár a kan papnak a rák!"
<p>
<i>Translations, oh poet?</i>
<p>
In French it is called le chien,<br>
In Russian, sabaka, my friend<br>
Das hund for Germanics<br>
El perro (Hispanic)<br>
Latin, canis; Georgian, jighla. The end.
<p>
<i>That one we got...</i>
<p>
The point of the Great Chinese Wall<br>
Was a place for their poems to be scrawled<br>
Sure, it was needed,<br>
But it's been superceded<br>
With the advent of pay toilet stalls.
<p><img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The French is one tongue I'll forego<br>
And with good reason for doing so:<br>
The spelling's a wreck,<br>
Man, e-a-u-x<br>
Is no way to spell a long "o"!
<p>An Irishman's sad tale of grief:<br>
Dyslexic beyond all belief,<br>
Instead of the usual<br>
Patty's day victuals<br>
He served up corned beer and green beef.

Fred's heart attack, while on the links,<br>
Was tragic and painful, methinks.<br>
It was on hole thirteen<br>
At the edge of the green.<br>
We dragged him five holes and had drinks.

When He was questioned by Eve, God told 'er<br>

If I'd made you first, madam<br>
And then I'd made Adam<br>
You'd have been kibbitzing over my shoulder."

Reject ambition, stay loose -<br>
For it is an excuse<br>
For not having enough sense to be lazy !

That Spring flooding is now their fate.<br>
Is it too much wet snow?<br>

Or has Champlain just grown to be Great?
