Rock hard and apparently on fire,<br>
His dick he thrust that much higher,<br>
He cried "I'm cumming,I am",<br>

Just got blessed by the local town friar!

<h3>Canadian Joe writes 12/28/98</h3>
A  beaver is quite an odd dish,<br>
When it's absent there's times I do wish,<br>
To fondle and finger,<br>
To let my tongue linger,<br>
Awash in a smell of ripe fish.

There was once a young suck-it from nantucket<br>
If you gave her a bucket she'd fuck it<br>
W all came around on sundays<br>
Catch her drowned in half-shitty hay<br>
If the donkey would drop it she'd duck it.

She got her fill<br>
Said the dentist, "Ma'am you tasted like cider"!

And a goat is divine<br>
But the llama is Numero Uno!

<h3><a href=mailto:dkauf17a@aol.com>Conch</a> writes 12/26/98</h3>
Ancient Greeks had quite lusty emotions<br>
Which caused population explosions<br>
So fast they'd conceive<br>
That we're led to believe<br>
They had almost no knowledge of Trojans.

All had sex one day in a car<br>
Poor Bill was sure missed<br>
And Monica was  pissed<br>
Because Kenneth forgot the cigar!
<p>
Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
You've got to be quick on your feet<br>
To run to the shitter<br>
Until the poopie done quitter<br>
Just make sure that you clean off the seat!

There was an old whore from Vancouver,<br>
Whose vagina could pass for a Hoover,<br>
In the old sixty-niner,<br>
She give you a shiner,<br>
From the cling-ons hanging off her old pooper!
<p>
The breasts on the waitress were voluptuous,<br>
They seemed to call out to me, "Touch us",<br>
All through supper she teased me,<br>
Then said she wanted to please me,<br>
But by then I had an eruptus!

<p>

<h3>Big Fig shares a classic 12/22/98</h3>

When he couldn't get these<br>
He lived on the cheese<br>
That he scratched from his nuts with his nails
<p>
There once was a whore from Sydney<br>
Who could take it up to her kidney<br>
A man from Quebec<br>
Stuck it up to her neck!<br>
He had a big one didn't he?

<p>There once was a man from Lachine<br>
Who built a wack-off machine<br>
On the very first stroke<br>
The fucking thing broke<br>
And mashed his balls all to cream!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a whore named Remorse,<br>
Who boasted of her skills, (well of course!)<br>
Her sex was of one kind,<br>
It was always from behind,<br>
'Cause up front she was hung like a horse!
<p>
This story is vile, to the letter,<br>
But I'd really should tell it, I'd better,<br>
Down on her he did not lag,<br>
Oralling through that wet rag,<br>
He should not have worn a white sweater.
<p>His balls did ache, yes quite sore,<br>
He was to meet her at quarter past four,<br>
Next to her he did sit,<br>
But he had stepped in dog shit,<br>
So she left with her trusty vibrator!
<p>The runs she did have, what a mess,<br>
But he fingered her ass none the less,<br>
She let out a huge "Yike",<br>
He pulled his finger  from the dike,<br>
T'was not water that vented I'd guess!
<hr>
<h3>Canadian Joe writes 12/20/98</h3>
The situation was trying and well, quite crass,<br>
I fought the movement until the end,but alas,<br>
Along the highway and overflowing with dread,<br>
My bowels began to rear its ugly head,<br>
I remove my sock and vigorously wipe my ass!
<p>
I began this with a huge expectation,<br>
Of wildly concocted creation,<br>
And though my block has now lifted,<br>
My mind has since drifted,<br>
To thoughts of satisfying masturbation!
<p>
<i>The Sage thinks this is so close to being wonderful - but "satisfying" needs to be 
replaced with a two-syllable word with an accent on the 2nd syllable to match the 
scansion.  Any <a href=mailto:eric@toastpoint.com>good ideas</a> out there?</i>
<p>
In response, Bluebird suggested <i>sublime, divine</i> and <i>superb</i>.  Matthew 
liked <i>divine</i> as well.  Steel Bishop chimed in with <i>wondrous</i>.  Toast Point votes for <i>sublime</i>.

A sprightly old bugger named Hackett<br>

Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr<br>

Miss Trip screwed her friend<br>
And for sooth, in the end<br>
Ken and Monica paint us all with their tar.

Would you call oral sex clean or dirtical,<br>
Since today, it is incontrovertible<br>
That it's modern and noble<br>
To be upwardly mobile<br>
Does that also include sexually vertical?

Two soldier boys, bold and brave were feeling their oats one day<br>So they went down to the local brothel to see what there
was to lay-<br>
The lines were long, the tempers short, as madam quoted her prices to pay<br>
Around the world, a handcar to town and other
sexual soirees!<br>
Our lads were apprehensive until the first client came out,<br>
He said, "Hold on tight to her ears lads! And she's got a helluva'
snout!"<br>
The soldier boys had a change of heart when they spied the tart at the door. <br>
Buzzing round her rear were a pack of nasty flies.<br>
She also had four legs and a pair or beady eyes!<br>
Our soldiers turned and ran! And almost flipped their wigs! <br>
When the hooker they were waiting for, turned out to be a pig!

It's not your commission<br>
To elicit contrition,<br>

"Paula Jones, lying nude, made me pale. <br>
I refused her brash offer of tail.<br>
He legs spread a bit<br>
And I licked on her clit. <br>

But I swear that I didn't inhale!"<p>

Through chapped lips, a gay Brit lipped on chaps, <br>
Who lapped chips in a pub near the taps.<br>
His teeth were a-snaggle, <br>
So he left a gaggle <br>
Of sore chaps with severely chipped laps.

<h4>by William N. Nesbit </h4>

To cast votes for Chicago's machine.

Women lust for us guys in tight pants;<br>
So when it's all over,<br>
We screw in the clover; <br>
Last Friday I drowned fifty ants. 
<p>

For Creation, but each was a dud. <br>
God's masterful plan<br>
For creating a man: <br>
To supply his mosquito with blood.
<p>

<h4>by Norm Storer </h4>
A preacher, just back from a mission, <br>
Admitted with pious contrition<br>
That he'd failed as a priest<br>
To save souls--but at least,<br>
He had taught them a brand-new position.
<p>

<h4>by Kent B. Hale</h4>
Did you know, deer break wind as they fly?<br>
Enough gas to light up the sky. <br>
The air is so ripe<br>
I can't light up my pipe. <br>
It's enough to make old Santa Cry.

<h4>by Loren C. Fitzhugh </h4>
I mislay things and it is a grind <br>
For lost loves and lost car keys I've pined.<br>
I've stopped trying to keep <br>
Any track of lost sheep,<br>
But what I miss most is my mind.

She lost cases she tried at the bar;<br>
But she'll frankly admit<br>
She enjoyed losing IT <br>
In the bumpy back seat of a car.
<p>

Such carnal desire<br>
We can scarcely admire, <br>
When he's failing to teach our position.
<p>

<h4>by William N. Nesbit </h4>
Brother Brad's unconventional style <br>
In converting a pagan, nubile,<br>

Mount her, chanting a line<br>
From the Gospel of Luke all the while.

<h4>by Al Willis </h4>

They were big, soft, and round, <br>
And just touched the ground,<br>
And this is as good as it gets.

To the driver's seat "Rosie" could climb, <br>

"Parsley's stage and Rosemary's on time." 
<p>

<h4>by Al Willis </h4>
She gambles, 'cause money's her goal. <br>

She hides cards in her bra, <br>
And once, in the raw, <br>
She was found with an ace in the hole.

In a brothel, two dykes asked, with snickers, <br>

<h4>by Don Moore </h4>
On the beach, a young girl of New York, <br>
Wore a swim suit that made mens' necks torque.<br>
Though to call it a suit<br>

Being just two Band Aids and a cork.

Revealing his sketches, Jacques Souder<br>
Said, "Of these gowns I couldn't be prouder.<br>
With backs cut to new lows<br>

And one company <br>
In its ads says "no fart can escape."

Of many an lady friend's womb.
