I believe it is wise to conclude<br>
That a cat or a dog can be shrewd.<br>
If the doorbell should ring,<br>
Just ignore the darn thing...<br>
Cos you can't trust pets to watch your food!

In voices -- oh! -- hushed and intonious<br>
With harshest decree sanctimonious<br>
"Impeach him!" quoth Hyde;<br>
"There's no doubt that he lied --<br>
About sex! and we judge him felonious."

Or terrible wheezes,<br>
Or noxious diseases<br>
You'll some day be glad for Viagra.

A goldfish whom circling frustrated<br>
Found, at Christmas, his appetite sated<br>
He said  "A tank full of turkey -<br>
(which made it all murky)<br>

<h3>Squeaky writes 12/21/98</h3>
Of Democratic resolve, we applaud,<br>
But their perception of fact is quite flawed<br>
They stick together like glue,<br>
Disregarding what's true,<br>
And their conclusions are defiantly flawed.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "....Is this how most of us really feel???"</i>
<p>
When a surgeon takes a cancerous lump,<br>
To call him a hero, we'll jump.<br>
So, why is the opposite true,<br>
In the Democrats' view,<br>
Of impeaching that arrogant hump?

But a limerick it's not,<br>
And it ain't got no plot,<br>
He misses much more than he hits!

<h3>Canadian Joe writes 12/20/98</h3>
Up north we wonder about all the fuss,<br>
About Clinton and the infidelity bus,<br>
The tabloid press feeding off of the strife,<br>
We'd just tell 'em "Go get a life",<br>
In the end it is better you than us!
<hr>
<h3>Observer writes 12/19/98</h3>
The nurse quickly sought to induce<br>
The elderly fellow named Bruce<br>
To kindly refrain<br>
From doing it again<br>

Said, "The history of this is unknown.<br>
It might be from Mars,<br>
Or one of the stars,<br>
And no doubt caused that hole in the ozone!"

<h3>K R Swift writes 12/18/98</h3>
An impatient rhymer named Swift<br>
Cried "I sent you a fine limerick gift!<br>
But my need isn't sated<br>

<h3>K R Swift writes 12/17/98</h3>
I'm writing because I'm frustrated<br>
My desire to rhyme  can't be sated<br>
Once I've E-mailed stuff in<br>
I can't tell when it's  been<br>
Till you print the damn thing and it's dated!
