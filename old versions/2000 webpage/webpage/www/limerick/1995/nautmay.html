<h3>Winning judge's honors in the "classic" category,<br>
Artie the Jungle Troll writes 5/26</h3>
While smearing my partner with butter<br>
She started to groan and to mutter:<br>
"Before you do ride me<br>
I need some inside me!"<br>
So I greased up the shaft of my putter!
<p>

<h3>Topping the "suggestive without being explicit" category,<br>
Dr. Bartolo writes 5/22</h3>
The exploits of Madame Nibiski<br>
Were trashy and just a bit risky -<br>
Among truckers she'd roam<br>
And take each one home<br>
After getting him bombed on cheap whiskey!
<p>

<h3>Taking home the "guffaw" category in a walk,<br>
Drayton INC writes 5/19</h3>
We all know that tampons are spongey<br>
And oftentimes get rather grungy<br>
But why they have strings<br>
Among other things<br>
Is so that the crabs can all bungee.
<p>

<h3>And finally, in the "best rhyme" category,<br>
Tarazed writes 5/17</h3>
A man who had more than one penis<br>
Was renowned here and there as a genius.<br>
Said his girlfriend, 'Although<br>
You're no fun to blow<br>
When you plug up both holes you're the keenest!'
<hr>
<h2>Dishonorable Mention:</h2>
<h3>Artie the Jungle Troll writes 5/26</H3>
Phone sex: What's with all the fuss?<br>
Why should I pay someone to cuss<br>
For three bucks a minute?<br>
There's not much sin in it<br>
And the spunk's just a bit of a muss.
<HR>
<h3>Fizzia's Evil Twin writes 5/24</h3>
I'm often quite horny and drunk,<br>
And that beast he sure was a hunk,<br>
Horny in the woods,<br>
He gave me the goods,<br>
That bear bopped me right in my trunk!
<hr>
<h3>Pthirus writes 5/20</h3>
If you're one who oft chokes his chicken<br>
And you find your digits are stickin'<br>
Hook a wet/dry vac<br>
Up to your nut sack<br>
No mess! Which means less finger lickin.<br>
<hr>
<h3>Buckaroo writes 5/19</h3>
Inverting his latent perversions<br>
he mad monk, he shouted aspersions;<br>
He cried "I'm Rasputin<br>
And I love rootin'-tootin'<br>
With nuns, 'spite their animadversions!"<br>
<h6>NOTE: Toast Point is not quite sure what this means.</h6>
<hr>
<h3>Carl-Magnus writes 5/19</h3>
When attempting to *69<br>
On the telephone, I will remind<br>
As much as you might pout<br>
That leaving the star out<br>
Will not help the or'lly inclined.
<hr>


<h3>Buckaroo writes 5/18</h3>
A courtesan eating falafel<br>
Auctioned herself via raffle<br>
She sold twenty tickets<br>
To some Lord with rickets<br>
Quoth he: "Ho! My chances are awful!"<p>

Two sisters infested with crabs<br>
Resorted to pokes and to jabs<br>
When the elder (elated)<br>
Said she felt obligated<br>
To collect the small lice for the labs.

<hr>

<h3>Mr. Debutts writes 5/18</h3>
One day in the Emerald Isle<br>
A leprechaun found me nubile.<br>
When he reached for my fanny,<br>
Said I, very canny,<br>
"Beat it, you old pedophile."

<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 5/18</h3>
Tamara, that marvelous vixen<br>
Her preference? A nasty nine-sixin'.<br>
'Tis said that she's abled<br>
Like timepieces fabled:<br>
Takes a tick 'n' she keeps on licksin'.

<hr>

<h3>Mr. Vance Briceland writes 5/17</h3>
A pop singer name of Madonna<br>
Fellated cold chocolate banonas<br>
And hauled in a hurry<br>
Before judge and jury<br>
Said "They're longer and harder, your honna'!"
<hr>

<h3>Tim Stuby writes 5/17</h3>
A pop singer name of Madonna<br>
Oft sits (like a virgin) upon a<br>
Rabid old french poodle<br>
Who chomps on her doodle<br>
And gets soaked as if it's in a sauna.
