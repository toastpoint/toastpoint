<h2>The Winners So Far!</h2>
<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/30</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
A Southern Alberta Rotarian<br>
Was possessed of a long and a hairy 'un.<br>
It was always erect<br>
And is why, we suspect,<br>
He was known as "Bone-on the Calgarian".

<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/29</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
When she felt his hands touching her knees,<br>
The girl, to her lover, said, "Please,<br>
When you've finished down there,<br>
Would you kindly take care<br>
First of this, next of that, then of these?"
<p>

"Though I'm pretty broadminded," lisped Roy,<br>

I heard that she would never say no<br>
To oral sex. Just 10 bucks for a blow.<br>
But when down on her knees<br>
I said "Oh baby please<br>
Please move up, you're too low, that's my toe!"<br>

<h3>Ogden Nield writes 11/27</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
A buxom young thing, our Nurse Nancy - <br>
Her male patients often she'd fancy<br>
She'd join 'em in bed<br>
Give the world's greatest head<br>
Each visit was thrilling - if chancy!

<hr>
<h3>CTD via Tony Davie (ad@dcs.st-and.ac.uk) submits 11/23</h3>
Some say Chinese women are blessed<br>
With pudenda which lie East and West - <br>
But enquiries have found<br>
That the theory's unsound -<br>
They point Northwards, the same as the rest.

<hr>
<h3>Ogden Nield (writerman@igc.net) writes 11/22</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
Lady Di said, "This is absurd!<br>
I'll show Charles just who has the last word!"<br>
So to shake up the Brits,<br>
She uncovered her tits<br>
And flipped the Queen Mother the bird!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
While dining on Thanksgiving turkey<br>
A woman began acting quirky<br>
Without saying a word<br>
She made love to the bird -<br>
Well,.. the rest of the story gets murky.

<hr>
<h3>Martin A. Thompson submits a HUGE one 11/22</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
King Henry's new wife he did hate her,<br>
For she farted and pissed when he ate her,<br>
Sex with her did he dread,<br>
So he chopped off her head,<br>
But he saved the remainder...for later!<p>

He used her most often at night,<br>
She was harder to see without light,<br>
Never once did she moan,<br>
When he drove himself home,<br>
But never once did she put up a fight!<p>

From then on she was faithful and true,<br>
Though her flesh turned purple and blue,<br>
For a while she was hot,<br>
When she'd started to rot,<br>
Then she bloated and ripped right in two!<p>

He relied on her for his releases,<br>
Decomposition formed natural greases,<br>
Then with undying love... a push and a shove,<br>
Undying passion... not subject to fashion,<br>
Frantic emotion... and ferverous motion,<br>
He literally loved her to pieces!<p>

She looked like she'd been through a meat-grinder,<br>
But depending on how he aligned her,<br>
She could take what he had,<br>
Without oozing too bad,<br>
It worked best with a pillow behind her!<p>

She lasted nigh onto a year,<br>
And you may think his habits quite queer,<br>
But could you justify waste,<br>
On pretense of good taste,<br>
With the body you yearned for   s o   n e a r !<p>

For a while he thought he might freeze her,<br>
"Make it last!" thought the horny ol' geezer,<br>
But he noted with awe,<br>
She took ten days to thaw,<br>
To the point where a fellow could seize her!<p>

King Henry became an old man,<br>
He relied more and more on his hand,<br>
But he never forgot her,<br>
His lovable rotter,<br>
The ripest in all o' the land!!!<p>

<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>Mr. Thompson wrote this disgusting thing 
in 1981 
for a contest at a graduate pub at Carleton
University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</i>

<h3>Tony Davie submits one for his late father 11/22</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
The surrogate Bishop of Ayr<br>
Was reduced to a state of despair<br>
By the fact that his dreams<br>
Contradicted the themes<br>
Of his eloquent leadings in prayer.

<hr>
<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/21</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
A young lady from old Amarillo<br>
Mused, as she lay on her pillow,<br>
If, and when, I give in,<br>
Would it be a great sin<br>
If it's only a small peccadillo?

<hr>
<h3>Ogden Nield writes 11/17</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
A curious thing, the vagina...<br>
Said the doctor of cology (gyne)<br>
It has lips that don't talk<br>
And goes "squish" when you walk<br>
But I've never seen anything fina!<p>


<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
The bulldyke once said to the femme<br>
I'll bet that your pussy's a gem<br>
Your nips are like berries<br>
Your lips are like cherries<br>
And your cum is the creme de la creme!<p>

<h3>Baker of Houston writes 11/12</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
There once was a nymph, name of Rodham<br>
Who, with Bill, was traveling to Soddam.<br>
Bill paused on the way<br>
For a bit of foreplay,<br>
But neglected Ms. Rodham's fine bottom.

There was a young girl named Marie<br>
Who fancied the men of the sea,<br>
So she dressed as a sailor<br>
And bordered a whaler,<br>
And now she gets harpooned for free!

<h3>John Futhey writes 11/11</h3>
A hustler rustled her bustle<br>
With her glutious maximus muscle<Br>

<h3>A poet who might be Martin Wellborn writes 11/2</h3>
"Miss Jones," Clinton said, with affection,<br>
"Oh please, won't you lick my erection . . ."<br>

Misunderstood Willy<br>
And thought he said: "Wreck my election."
<hr>
<h3>Phred writes 11/2</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
That despicable Molly McGrue<br>
Taught young innocent boys how to screw.<br>
   She gave them directions<br>
   And praised their erections<br>
Before any pubic hair grew.

<h3>Ogden Nield (writerman@igc.net) writes 11/30</h3>

Resisted when he tried to fuck her<br>
And so when instead<br>
She gave Gable head<br>
He said the line, "so long.... sucker!"

<h3>Jim-Ski Rock Ho writes 11/30</h3>
I found a dead nun in a sewer<br>
I knew then and there that I'd do her<br>
I started to stab it<br>
I came on her habit<br>
And filled her cunt hole with manure<p>
<b>Note from the Sage</b> - <i>Mr. Ho is doing much the same with the contests.</i>

<h3>Maggie Sargent writes</h3>
There once was a girl named Rose,<br>

When a crab jumped and bit him in the nose!

<hr>
<h3>Rancid Rick writes 11/29</h3>
An blowjob, very skilled, known as Sue - <br>
She loved cock and gobbling goo,<br>
She would guzzle your load<br>
Til your nuts would implode.<br>
And leave you with nothin' to spew.

<hr>
<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/28</h3>
On the G-string of my Stradivarius<br>
I'm often inspired to play various<br>
Airs and concerti<br>
With themes that are dirty,<br>
Disgusting, and downright nefarious.<p>

There was a young girl from St. Justin<br>
Bought a new bra to uplift her bust in.<br>
But her breasts sagged all day<br>
And she, sad to say,<br>
Lost her trust in the cups they were trussed in.

<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 11/28</h3>
My girlfriend said once you've gone black<br>
To white you'll never go back.<br>
The dongs are so long<br>
You will never go wrong<br>
In getting the best in the sack!

<hr>
<h3>Ogden Nield writes 11/27</h3>
Fernando, a seller of cheese<br>
Was at best a purveyor of sleaze<br>
It came from his toes<br>
So offended the nose<br>
That it brought a grown man to his knees.

<hr>

<h3>M D McFarland writes 11/24</h3>
There once was a man from Hong Kong<br>
Who liked to show women his dong<br>
But along came Miss Bobbitt<br>
Who just wouldn't have it<br>
And now his poor dong is long gone.<p>

Understanding her father was not<br>
When I told him his daughter was hot<br>
He forbade me to see her<br>
So I'll just have to steal her<br>
Oh Lord, I pray I'm not caught!

<hr>
<h3>Govindhan Padmavijayam writes 11/20</h3>

and said "this is from Australia ..", and went down under !



<hr>
<h3>Rob from Nashville writes 11/17</h3>

Who shoved pork into her vagina;<br>
When her agony<br>
Sent her to the M.D.<br>
She learned of the worm called Trichina.
<hr>

<h3>Ogden Nield writes 11/17</h3>
A horny young fellow named Paul<br>
Stuck his cock in a plug in the wall<br>
It was juicy and hot<br>
And he liked it a lot<br>
And the plug didn't mind it at all!<p>

There was an old cripple named Hutch<br>
Whose lovemaking girls found too much!<br>
He'd stand on a chair<br>
Hold them up by the hair<br>
And do the poor things with his crutch!<p>

Five nuns on a mission from God<br>
Met a man with a beautiful bod<br>
They ripped off their habits<br>
And took turns like rabbits<br>
Worshipping his outstretched rod.

<h3>Dande shares a classic 11/11</H3>
On the bridge stood the young Duke of Buckingham<BR>
Thinking of tits and of Suckingham<BR>
While observing the stunts<BR>
Of the cunts in the punts<BR>
And the tricks of the pricks who were Fuckingham.

<hr>
<h3>Erin Christopher shares a classic 11/11</h3>

There once was a man named Jareem<br>
Who invented the whack-off machine<br>
On the 31st stroke<br>
The stupid thing broke<br>
And whipped his balls into a cream!

<hr>
<h3>John Futhey writes 11/11</h3>
Ten cows munching grass by a wall.<br>
Two bulls wander out of their stall.<br>
The young bull shouts "Run,<br>
We can each enjoy one!"<br>
The old bull says "Walk, and have all."

<h3>Anonymous shares a classic 11/9</h3>

Laid her flat on her back<br>
And united the organs they pissed with.

<h3>Mad-Matt shares a variation on 
<a href=nautoct.html#cave>Conan the Librarian</a>'s 
classic 11/8</h3>

I'm a bit of a shit,<br>
But think of the money I'll save!"

<h3>Muppet shares a classic 11/8</h3>
There once was a man from Cancun<br>
Who was born nine months too soon<br>
He didn't have the luck <br>
To be born by a fuck <br>
He was scaped off the sheets with a spoon.

<hr>
<h3>An anonymous poet writes 11/8</h3>
Inverting his latent perversions<br>
A mathematician pondered aspersions:<br>
"I'd give up all my fame<br>
If I just had a dame<br>
Who'd contort in all ten dimensions"

<h3>Toast Point writes 11/2</h3>
While Wumpus was cleaning the drains<br>
He showed off his undies by Hanes<br>
I went to caress him<br>
And then to undress him<br>
But got a black eye for my pains!
<hr>
<h3>Nicole Ryder writes 11/1</h3>
Have you seen that TV girl Heather?<br>
The one who announces the weather?<br>
I've heard of her fetish...<br>
And what makes her wettish<br>
Are beatings with straps made of leather!
