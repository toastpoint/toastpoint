<h4>Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/4</h4>
The opera's a terrible bore<br>
That Carmen's no more than a whore.<br>
Snored through Rigoletto<br>
(Forgot the libretto)<br>
And what's that darned racket, the score?

<h4>Larry Dahl writes 12/3</h4>
Sharon Stone is so icily stunning,<br>
Not to mention deceptive and cunning.<br>
A woman like she<br>
Could make any man flee<br>
But he'd surely look back while he's running.
<p>
<h4>Barrie Collins writes 11/29</h4>
Princess Di gave reporters the power<br>
To interview her for an hour<br>
And, with true British pluck<br>
She trashed Liz and Chuck;<br>
She's regretting it now in the Tower.
<p>
<h4>MJM writes 10/21</h4>

Cochrane, Shapiro, F. Lee<br>
As slick as three lawyers can be<br>
They persuaded the jury,<br>
To take out its fury<br>
On Fuhrman, and set O.J. free.<br>

<h4>Victoria... writes </a></h4>
A computer is just a machine.<br>
You could never call it obscene.<br>
So if you turn red,<BR>
From words that it said,<BR>
It's YOU who knows what they mean...
<p>
<h4>Barrie Collins writes 11/21</h4>
There are thousands of brands of computers,<br>
Each of which has its own rooters;<br>
And each rooter bristles<br>
If yours has more whistles<br>
Or klaxons or sirens or hooters.

<h4>Victoria... writes</h4>

The great battle was heavy and hot<br>
I just had to connect with each shot.<br>
But then, full of dread<br>
I found myself dead,<br>
So I put one more coin in the slot...

Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/9</h4>
Although liquor was Ogden's delight,<br>
Ev'ry night he'd get high as a kite!<br>
"One night I abstain."<br>
He said with disdain,<br>
"New Years Eve is Amateur Night!"
<p>
<h4>Millicent Friendly writes 6/12</h4>
One cannot express the elation<br>
Of flying off on on a vacation<br>
And finding the locals<br>
(The nice ones, not yokels)<br>
Engaging oneself in flirtation!

"So you take your wife everywhere. Why?<br>
She's so ugly she makes children cry!"<br>
"Well, if I should roam<br>
And leave her at home,<br>
I'm obliged then to kiss her goodbye!<br>

<h4>Larry Dahl writes 12/28</h4>
Newt has a plan with potential.<br>
He hopes to prove Bill non-essential.<br>
For if Clinton must go<br>
On a federal furlough,<br>
Then Newt can appear presidential.
<p>
<h4>and on 12/1</h4>
My computer will morph Robert Dole<br>
So his features resemble his soul.<br>
But wait!  That's no fun.<br>
It's already been done.<br>
No wonder he can't win a poll!

<h4><a href=mailto:writrman@icanect.net>
Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/12</h4>
A man of the Jewish persuasion<br>
Hated cabs - took the bus on occasion.<br>
Sounds funny, I guess<br>
But the old I.R.S.<br>
Got him for "taxi" evasion!

<h4>Beaker takes the "Botany" trophy with</h4>
An "outdoorsy" chick, fond of hikin'<br>
Soon learned she prefered mountain bikin'.<br>
For, when hiking on rocks<br>
"Yuckies" stuck to her socks.<br>
(Itchy, crisp, crunchy grungies called "lichen".)

<h4>Larry Dahl writes 12/5</h4>
I'm probably wasting my time<br>
Perfecting a limerick's rhyme.<br>
It's better to give them<br>
Immaculate rhythm<br>
For then they can reach the sublime.

<h4>His Peace writes</h4>
There once was a young man from Lyme<br>
Who scored a goal for the very first time!<br>
The young man was glad <br>
But his teammates were sad <br>
'Cause he hadn't changed sides at half time!
