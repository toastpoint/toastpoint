<h3>Buster writes</h3>
A decent young fellow named Herm<br>
Was equipped with a geyser-like worm:<br>
The size wasn't much<br>
But its volume was such<br>
That his lovers did backstroke in sperm.
<p>
<h3>Diana Prince writes 8/2</h3>
I see by the size of your member<br>
You're as hot as a blazing coal ember!<br>
So slicken that mast -<br>
And hon, make it fast -<br>
This girl's not been poked since December!

<h3>A poet who might be Martin Wellborn writes 12/1</h3>
Said the Abbot, "I'm not pleased one bit,<BR>
Brother Ambrose; that you should submit<BR>
Your signed IOU<BR>
In lieu of a ewe -<BR>
I just won't accept that sheep chit."

<h3><a href=mailto:writrman@icanect.net>
Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/11</h3>
"You, choirboy!" ordered the pastor<br>
"Bend over the pew for your Master!"<br>
He said with a moan<br>
As he slipped him a bone.<br>
"Now just wag your tail a bit faster!"

I know that you'll think me quite dotty,<BR>
But please, no caffeine in the latte!<BR>
One simple espresso -<BR>
I put on a dress, oh,<BR>
And really start acting quite naughty!

<h3><a name="bung">Drayton INC</a> writes 5/19</h3>
We all know that tampons are spongey<br>
And oftentimes get rather grungy<br>
But why they have strings<br>
Among other things<br>
Is so that the crabs can all bungee.

<h3>Ogden Nield writes 12/2</h3>
Goldilocks has lots of guys<br>
Pinnochio's one, I'm advised!<br>
She sits on the puppet<br>
And sticks his nose up it<br>
And makes the poor fellow tell lies!

"For Christmas", she said with a tingle<br>
"I'd love a gift cunnilingual!"<br>
Twas with joy and surprise<br>
She found twixt her thighs<br>
The tongue of jolly Kris Kringle!

<h3>Oldcoach writes:</h3>
Good marks for oldtimer, Omar.<br>
Who can't raise his tent very far.<br>
His plumbing is rusted<br>
He can't cut the mustard<br>
So's an expert at licking the jar.
<p>
<h3>Big Mike in Oz writes 9/7</h3>
Said the prostitute dropping her towel<br>
There's only one rule that I follow,<br>
You can insert your shaft<br>
In holes fore or aft,<br>
But its output I never will swallow.
<p>
<h3>Barrie Collins writes 11/29</h3>
When she felt his hands touching her knees,<br>
The girl, to her lover, said, "Please,<br>
When you've finished down there,<br>
Would you kindly take care<br>
First of this, next of that, then of these?"
<p>
<h3>Saffonda Cox writes</h3>
Were you a more elegant chap,<br>
I'd ask to sit down on your lap<br>
Cross-legg'd, like a swami<br>
For 'hide the salami',<br>
But it seems that you're ill with the clap!

<h3>A poet who might be Martin Wellborn writes 11/2</h3>
"Miss Jones," Clinton said, with affection,<br>
"Oh please, won't you lick my erection?"<br>
But Paula, so silly,<br>
Misunderstood Willy<br>
And thought he said: "Wreck my election."
<p>
<h3>JohnD writes</h3>
If you notice some sag in your tush<br>
And you've given Weight Watchers the brush,<br>
No need to feel sad<br>
Or judge yourself bad -<br>
You're surely less bloated than Rush.
<p>
His views are the match of his girth;<br>
They're outsize and would attract mirth<br>
But the ditto-head scrum<br>
Is so glum or so dumb<br>
That they egg on this not-upon-earth.
<p>
Oh, dearie, pontificate.<br>
Politicos do it in state<br>
Since they know they'll get warts<br>
Without their cohorts -<br>
But, Rush, go ahead, masturbate.

<h3>Barrie Collins writes</h3>
Said a limerick writer, "I'm stuck<br>
For a rhyme for a stud known as Chuck.<br>
Our staid population<br>
Proscribes copulation<br>
And won't let me use the word 'fuck'."

<h3>Not Cliff writes 12/6</h3>
There once was a Vulcan named Spock<br>
Who tried stroking his monstrous cock<br>
With lust went berserk<br>
And beseeched Captain Kirk,<br>
"Bend over, this shuttle must dock!"

Stan and Ginger</a></h2>
<h3>Stan and Ginger write throughout December</h3>
Ginger from County of Dade<br>
Said, "I think it's time I got laid."<br>
"My vibrator can tingle"<br>
"But it's not cunnilingual"<br>
"And that's how orgasms are made."
<p>
Ginger's bush was a true work of art<br>
It was coifed in the shape of a heart<br>
And just out of sight<br>
Was another delight<br>
A twat with the taste of a tart!
<p>
Her butt in the air looked so fair<br>
He wondered if he'd ever dare.<br>
To approach her he must.<br>
He was so full of lust.<br>
That Stan made her bottom show bare!

<p>
Stan was glad he'd begun this affair<br>
As he bent Ginger over the chair.<br>
With her legs spread apart<br>
He could see that this tart<br>
Was his favorite dessert, his eclair.
<p>
"I like anal sex, if you please"<br>
Said Ginger while down on her knees<br>
"I'm firm and I'm tight,<br>
I'm an utter delight!<br>
And I promise that I won't cut the cheese!"
<p>
While loaded from drinking some scotch,<br>
Ginger shaved all the hair from her crotch<br>
She now goes to work in<br>
A henna-hued merkin<br>
That matches the face of her Swatch!

<h3>Nick Scales writes 12/7</h3>
<em>Burdew's Screw</em><br>

An old desert rat named Burdew<br>
Came to town one day for a screw.<br>
He threw down a quarter<br>
And drawled out, "That orter<br>
Cover a quick poke or two."
<p>
The madam looked very askance<br>
At the grime on his shirt and his pants,<br>
His scruffy gray beard,<br>
The eyes that went weird,<br>
And the odor that wasn't from France.
<p>
"Ol" fella," she said with a grin,<br>
"For a quarter, I'll let you right in<br>
To a room that's just ripe<br>
For a man of your type<br>
And a gal that's ideal for your sin."
<p>
The prospector's eyes went aglow<br>
As the fire began burning below.<br>
His hands started shaking<br>
And his knees were aquaking.<br>
It was plain he was rarin' to go.
<p>
So they led him out back of the place<br>
To a shed with just enough space<br>
For the fattest pink sow,<br>
He'd seen anyhow<br>
With a sorta' sweet smile on her face.
<p>
Burdew shoved everyone aside,<br>
Slammed the door and was quickly astride<br>
His porky delight<br>
Where he spent the whole night<br>
In a passionate piggyback ride!
<p>
At daybreak, Burdew poked his head<br>
Out of the tumbledown shed<br>
With a satisfied sigh,<br>
He said, "Miss Piggy and I<br>
Will be having our breakfast in bed."

<h3>A poet who might be anyone, but is Michael Donn writes</h3>
A hard-headed cabby named Peter<br>
Was asked by a fare if he'd eat her.<br>
He said, "It's not free.<br>
I will only agree<br>
To go down while I'm running the meter."

<h3>Phred writes 10/24</h3>
A horny old trapper named Rex<br>
Liked the risks of wild porcupine sex.<br>
By incredible luck<br>
His dick never got stuck,<br>
But his nuts were just pitiful wrecks.
