Wumpus and I live in New York City and we see a lot of shows.  
<a href=http://www.playbill.com>Playbill Online</a> has a lot of good Broadway 
info, and articles, too!
And the <a href=http://artsnet.heinz.cmu.edu/OnBroadway/>OnBroadway</a> site 
lets you find out not only who's in a show right now, but 
who got nominated for 
Tonys and who won!<p>
<p>
Some of us genuflect daily in the direction of 
<a href=http://www.sondheim.com>Stephen Sondheim</a>.
<H4>Oh, Rapture!</h4>
Check out the <a
href="http://math.idbsu.edu/gas/GaS.html">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>
Archive!  Yum, yum!
<p>
G&S enthusiasts on the net hang out at <a href=http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/savoynet/>Savoynet</a>, 
which is the most entertaining LISTSERV mailing list out there by far.  A great 
community, a great bunch of people, and they even have a production 
of <a href=http://math.idbsu.edu/gas/trial/html/trial_home.html>Trial by Jury</a> under their belt!
<p>
And don't forget the Toast Point Page's <a href=rapture/rapture.html>Modified Rapture!</a>, a gleaning 
of rehearsal variants of G&S lines and lyrics.  Beware - some are quite naughty!

<h4>The Toast Point Theatrical Legacy</h4>
I spent a great deal of my college career at William and Mary involved in 
<a href=http://www.sinfonicron.org>Sinfonicron</a>, which is not 
a satanic organization, but rather a student-run light opera company.  
It's been around forever and boasts such luminary alumni as Calvin Remsberg.  When 
I was a wee freshman, they did Gilbert and Sullivan every year, but during my 
career, they broke away and did <em>The Merry Widow</em> and since have produced 
such shows as <em>Evita</em> and <em>42nd Street</em>.
<p>
Around the same time, I spent a couple of summers working with 
<a href=http://www.wst.org/>Wildwood Summer Theatre</a>, a youth-run 
group which has also been around forever and boasts such luminary alumni as 
Jonathan Hadari and Stella Zambalis.
<p>
Once I got through with the school thing, I ended up in Philadelphia, where 
I did such killer shows as <em>Evita</em> and <em>Follies</em> with 
<a href=http://www.netaxs.com/~mss/pcs.html>The Players Club of Swarthmore</a>, 
a community theatre group whose grasp is extraordinary, and whose reach often 
achieves it.

<h3>Eric shows you the way to wonderful artists you've never heard of:</h3>
Like all of you, I thought folk music was overly sincere hippies
with bad voices 
singing about the rainforests - until I fell hopelessly and
completely in
love with <A HREF="http://www.automatrix.com/~lavin/">Christine
Lavin</a>.  And I feel oh-so-proud, because I introduced Christine's music 
to <a href=http://www.songs.com/susan/susan-home.html>Susan Werner</a>, 
a fellow cast member in an opera we did years ago, 
and Susan is now a famous (and very talented) folk singer herself and a Friend of Christine's!
<p>
I may be the only person on the east coast who's ever heard of 
folk/rock singer <a href=http://www.michaeltomlinson.com>Michael 
Tomlinson</a>, but I have all his albums and he's a very interesting singer.  A 
spiritually and environmentally aware songwriter, his songs are 
soothing and inspiring.  Check out his web page, and if you are interested 
in finding out what he's like, I would order <em>Run This Way Forever</em> as 
your starter album.
<p>
Another wonderful folk singer who I discovered because *blush* I liked 
his picture on the album cover is Maine-based 
<a href=http://www.super-charged.com/dmallett/>David Mallett</a>.  
You've probably heard his <a href =http://www.super-charged.com/dmallett/sounds/garden.wav>
Garden Song</a> on PBS.  I would think that he'd be too close to the land to have a home page, but there it is.
<h3>Eric shows you the way to tacky but fun artists who you'll never 
admit to liking:</h3>
Thank you, 
<a href=http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/3973/abfab.htm>AbFab</a>, 
for bringing us the knowledge of the existence of hopelessly self-referential 
rap-song artist <a href=http://www.netzone.co.uk/tempest/boo/boo.html>Betty Boo</a>.   Nothin' you can do when Boo's doin' the do!
<p>
Thank you, Sweden, for engendering <a href=http://www.sirius.com/~funnyguy/abbanaticfolder/abbanatic.html>ABBA</a>, 
the finest pop group of all time.  And they're multilingual, too!

<h3>Rainbow Symphonic Winds/Big Apple Corps/LGBA</h3>
Last year, I was appointed Artistic Director of New York's  
<a href=http://www.dorsai.org/~jazzbike/band3.htm>Lesbian and Gay 
Big Apple Corps Concert Band</a> (formerly the Rainbow Symphonic Winds of NY),
a member of the <A
HREF="http://www.gaybands.org">Lesbian and Gay Bands
of America</A>.  Our next concert, April 10, includes the complete "Pictures at an Exhibition".

If you can't remember who starred in <em>The Last American Virgin</em>, or 
want to view Charles Bronson's resume, you can't do better than the

<h3><a name="books">Books</a></h3>
I read constantly (mostly mysteries, thrillers and SF, as you'll see), but I haven't found all that many web pages celebrating 
my favorite authors.  For instance, my favorite living SF author is John Varley, but 
he don't have a page out there - gosh, Eric, maybe you should... nah...  
However, you can always start with:
<ul><li>
<a href=http://www.suegrafton.com/>Sue Grafton</a>'s Kinsey Millhone series.  It's easy to 
figure out the order of this series (and I hate reading books out of order), as the first is 
<em>A is for Alibi</em>, the second is <em>B is for Burglar</em> and so on.  She's up to N 
now and author Stan Cutler, in his straight/gay detective partners in Hollywood series, had his 
characters speculate what she might do after Z - perhaps <em>AA is for Alcoholics Anonymous</em>?  
I vote for punctuation myself.  
<li>
<a href=http://www.mindspring.com/~mmessall/francis/>Dick Francis</a>, British 
author of thrillers, all in the first person, all involving horse racing in 
some form or other.  Doesn't sound appealing?  Didn't to me either at first (horses?), but 
once you start, you can't stop.  He's been putting 'em out for thirty years and each one 
is a wonderful read.
<li>
The sadly-deceased <a href=http://innet.com/~cbranche/jdm.html>John D. MacDonald</a>, 
creater of the Florida detective and boat bum 
<a href=http://pages.prodigy.net/mwarble/slipf18/mcgee/>Travis McGee</a>.  I inherited my 
taste in trashy fiction from my mother, who had me reading Travis McGee books when I was 
eight.  It's wonderful to reread them now that I know what the sex stuff is all about.  They hold 
up beautifully, by the way.
<li>I'm not a Florida fanatic or anything, but Florida detective fiction seems 
to be a new genre and I like <a href=http://www.booktalk.com/PLevine/>Paul Levine</a>'s 
Jake Lassiter series an awful lot.  
<a href=http://studbimb.tuwien.ac.at/~e9225468/hiaasen.html>Carl Hiaasen</a> is 
another Floridian.  His novels are hilarious and outrageous - yes, he did write 
<em>Striptease</em>, and yes, it's much better than you thought the movie was.
<li>
My early psyche was formed by reading lots and lots of 
<a href=http://www.wegrokit.com/rah.htm>Heinlein</a>.  He's also sadly deceased, but what 
a wonderful writer, and way ahead of his time.  Even though, his whole last set of books seem 
to be about, as my uncle says, "How he wants to be a woman."  Well, maybe he did!
<li>
<a href=http://urtho.hypermart.net/>Mercedes Lackey</a> is noted for gay-friendly fantasy 
(no, not <b>that</b> 
kind of fantasy).  I'm not particularly a sword'n'sorcery fan, but I like her books.  And a 
good thing, because she churns out trilogy after trilogy like Lucy's chocolate factory.</ul>
I myself have written no fiction, but you can 
see essays I've written in <a href=ponder.html>Toast Points to Ponder</a>.  And of course, this 
<i>is</i> the home of <a href=fiction/fiction.html>The Bad Fiction Contest</a>!
