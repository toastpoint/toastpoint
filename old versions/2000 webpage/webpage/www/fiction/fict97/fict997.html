<h3><a href=mailto:byoung@brookings.net>Eugenius</a> begins a Fantasy Public Transportation novel 09/25/97</h3>

Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.    For a train of thought must always be 
kept on schedule.  Otherwise one might encounter a host of arising problems 
not the least of which would be a horde of unhappy commuters rioting at the ticket boothes.  This rioting would ultimately lead to a decrease 
in the morale of the booth operators, thus resulting in a looming fear of an impending stike that would inevitably occur whenever 
there is any cause for some sedentary organization, like a union, to have a cause.  This strike would cause commuters to find 
alternative transportation would result in a decrease in revenues.  In order to offset such a decrease in revenues, ticket prices 
would have to be raised and that would just discourage the rest of the railway patrons.  Then ultimately having absolutely no 
patrons, one would not be able to meet overhead costs and financial obligations, forcing a compulsory filing of a chapter
eleven.  Then one's credit, that he worked so hard for all his life, would be reduced to nothing more than a smoldering mound of 
sodden ashes upon which every walking ex-commuter would tread.  <p>
  There was no doubt about it.  This arrogant cleric, blatantly boasting such blunt power, would surely have to be destroyed.  
  With a swish of his mighty hand, Zog flicked back the wyrmyr-fur cape and clasped the little holy man in his giant grasp.
  The man squirmed in Zog's mightly clutch.  The sentence has been obvious from the outset.
None had ever escaped such a punishment and the cleric's eyes widened as he suddenly realized what was to become his fate.
  Zog gripped the cleric's hand and held it so as to point the index finger of his left hand skyward.  He then leaned down and 
touched it to the electric third rail.

<h3>Dirty Harry and the Sundance Chicken begins a Fantasy novel 09/22/97</h3>
Papa Smurf and his whore Genvieve moved to Finland.  They spent their days and nights rounding up all the sheep from town and putting them into the 5000 outhouses nestled about on their extensive farm.  It was just too bad that every night Papa Smurf had to go into each of the potty rooms and get his way with the male sheep.  Genvieve found him naked on a stool in one of the outhouses one day and immediately began questioning him.  "Why do you do this to me?" she asked in an angered voice.  He replied, "I only do this because you're always out working the corner every night."  "I am not working the corner," she yelled back at him, "I'm working every man in the village so hard that they can't move for days!"
