Zortion Zobey slung his noodle strings and Martian meat balls at the 
wall.  "I want a peanut capsule and gelatin sandwich instead!" yelled Zobey. <p>
Zobey's droid-dad zoomed into the kitchen where Zobey sat.  "Son!" shouted his dad, "You clean this mess up now!" <p>
Zobey took out his super Stay-Clean eraser and rubbed the dirty wall 
with it. The mess vanished from the wall and was now sparkling clean. <p>
"Zobey, could you oil my joints?" asked his dad, "I want to look good 
for my job interview!" <p>Zobey went to get the oil can and ran into a Florp that was sneaking 
into the house. "FLORP!!!" shrieked the surprised Florp 
that was holding a TV.  The Florp dropped the TV and jumped out the 
window.  Zobey ran back into the kitchen to tell his dad that they were 
being robbed. <p>
 "We're being robbed!" shouted Zobey, but his droid-dad was too rusted 
to say or do anything.   "Oops!" said Zobey, "I forgot the oil can!" <p> Zobey went and got the oil
can and took it over to his dad. Then Zobey told his dad what happened 
after he oiled him.   "Did he take anything?" asked his dad . Zobey proudly said, "Nope! I 
stopped him before he could!"  Then Zobey took his dad into the living 
room and said, "See! Nothing's gone!" <p>
His dad's eyes grew bigger than 
his head. "What do you mean nothing's gone?!" yelled his dad looking around the 
empty living room, "Everything is gone!" Zobey started to say something 
by his dad started talking again.
 "You lied, you're grounded!" He said as he got his briefcase out of 
the always-room closet. <p>
 "But...But...I...." sputtered Zortion Zobey. <p> 
His dad got his jacket and
 stepped into the super transportion-elevator.
 "You stay in your room until I get home from the interview!" ordered 
Zobey's dad. Then he got sucked through the big tube in the elevator and
was taken to the office building where he was supposed to go for his job. <p>
Zobey went to his room and started to play his video games.
 "Game over!" said the computer when Zobey's ship got blown up.
 "I lost!" said Zobey angrily. Then he turned it off.  Suddenly there was
a loud bang outside, and someone busted the door down. <p>
"Freeze!" shouted a policeman who was holding a big fish,  "You are under
arrest!"  Then three more policemen walked in with walkie-talkies.
 "Milk, it does a body good, over!" said a police officer into his 
walkie-talkie. <p> Then a different policeman took out some cheese and a 
cheese grater.   "We can do this the easy way or the hard way!" said the policeman with 
the cheese over Zobey's head.
 "Where were you ten minutes ago?" demanded the officer.  Zobey thought 
for a second and then said, "Right here!" Then the policeman looked at 
his partner.
 "Sure! Like we're gonna believe a little kid like you!" snickered the 
policeman.
 "Do you got any proof?" he asked. Zobey started to tell him he had 
proof but the policeman cut him off.
 "No proof? Ah! Too bad!" he said, "Cuff him,boys!" Then two policemen 
came up to Zobey and hand-cuffed him. <p>
 "No! I'm too good looking to go to jail!" shouted Zortian Zobey as he 
got dragged away to the police hovercar (Hey! It's a different planet! 
What kind of car did you expect?!). <p>  
 Suddenly out of nowhere Zobey's Droid-dad zoomed up to him and started 
laughing.
 "That's what happens when you don't eat your noodle strings and martian
 meat balls!!!" laughed Zobey's dad.
 "See you in twenty years,son!"
<p>
 Zobey didn't realize that when you mess with food products you have to 
make the time up in..

<h3>Kurt L. Milk begins a Mystery novel 03/17/97</h3>
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.
Especially while staring into her jaded eyes, the damn gator slithers off your desk, into your lap and .....youch!
<p>
<I>The author comments, "Liked the previous sentences better.  These are harder & less inviting  to write for." </I> 
<p>
<I>Gee, and Toast Point was so proud of them...<a href=mailto:erique@ix.netcom.com>what do the rest of you think?</I>

Trixie, who in post-coital bliss, had fallen asleep in the back
seat of 
the patrol car when Elmer snuck back in his mother's trailer, which
had started 
rocking strangely back and forth not soon before the car stopped
its own 
rocking, didn't wake up again until her father had almost reached
the foot 
of Widow's Peak.  "WhatnHAYL..." Kix muttered, then whipped the car
off the 
road into the gravel at the foot of Bertram Lindenwood's driveway,
narrowly 
missing the squalling Flakers and their side-by-side pink Cadillacs.
<p>
"What were you doin' with that city feller!?" bellowed Flem,
shaking Flammie 
with his excrement-encrusted hands and smearing her pink rayon
party dress 
(which looked curiously out-of-place anyway in the daytime).
<p>
"What were YOU doin' with that Sofie Mae woman, rollin' around in
her 
hog waller?  Let go of me, you filthy..." shrieked Flammie,
slapping Flem 
with all her might, sending Press-On Nails flying in every
direction.
<p>
"Here now..." drawled Kix, delighted to have stumbled upon a reason
to 
exert his authority as town guardian... "Both of you, up against
the car!  
That's right, spread 'em!"  
<p>
"Flem, you're gonna have to LICK this car clean..." muttered a
furious 
Flammie as she complied, livid at the filthy state of her
second-best 
caddy.
<p>
After a quick frisk, Kix soon had each Flaker handcuffed to a door
handle of their respective Caddys.  "What'n'hell are both of you
squallin' about.  Flem?"
<p>
"Well, I was visitin' Miss Sofie Mae, to get her to come back to
the church 'n' all, but her hog escaped and ran down here, 's this
place was Floyd's, y'see, and ..."  Silenced from an evil glare by
Flammie, Flem shut up.
<p>
"And you, Miss Flammie?"
<p>
"Well, I wuz here to discuss some things with Mr. Lindenwood..."
<p>
"In a party dress?"
<p>
Flammie looked frightened, then recovered.  "I spilled somethin' on
my jumper - this was the only thing I had in the house..."
<p>
Oblivious to the interrogation in progress in his driveway, Bertie
slowly came to.  With a groan, he got to his feet, not quite sure
what happened, and rose to investigate the noises in his bedroom. 
"Miss Flammie, are you in there?"
<p>
The late afternoon sun shone strongly through his bedroom window,
causing a Close-Encounters backlighting effect as Sofie Mae
appeared in his bedroom doorway before he could enter.  "Hi," she
drawled, "A'm Sofie Mae Strunk.  I'm your neighbor up the mountain. 
Can y'all help me get mah hog from under your bed?"
<p>
Bertie, no less stunned by the silhouetted beauty in his bedroom
doorway than by the concept of a farm animal under his bed, replied
with less than his usual articulation, "Ummm...OK..."
<p>
Noting that he still wasn't moving, Sofie gently guided him inside
the bedroom with her hand.  "Now you just grab the foot and lift it
up, and I'll poke Petunia out this with here broom."
<p>
In a daze, he stood staring at her.  Sofie jumped, realizing that
her blouse had become undone yet again, and actually blushed as she
realized that <em>this</em> gentleman was not your typical Widow's
Peak resident, and might actually be worth knowing.  Those kind
eyes - although they were still spinning like marbles...  "Come ON,
Mr...."
<p>
"Um, Lindenwood, but you can call me Bertie, um..., ma'am...."
<p>
"Well, come on, then, help me out!"  Sofie turned, blushing,
realizing that she'd been staring a bit back herself.
<p>

Bertie, taken with the authenticity of Sophie Mae's accent as well as the obvious authenticity of her twin peaks peeking provocatively from her bodice, was at that point willing to do anything Sophie bade him, so with an uncharacteristic (for him) strength, he seized the foot of the bed and lifted it high in the air while Sophie simultaneously smiled approvingly  and, with a grip mastered by hours of hog hauling, extricated the hiding hog who was nestled amongst the dust bunnies.   Seeing her hog was safe, Bertie lowered the bed, the resulting thud so startling Petunia that she flung herself upon Bertie  knocking up backward 
and breathless upon the bed. As the hog  snuggled onto his chest and snorted into his ear, Bertie found himself unable to move or even gasp for help. 
<p>
"Gosh-a-mighty, Mr. Lind - ah, Bertie, Ah ain't never seen Petunia cotton to a man like she does to y'all. I reckon she must be in heat," Sophie Mae exclaimed, feeling a bit in heat herself for the object of her hog's desire.  "Does y'all like hogs?" she inquired hopefully.<p>
Bertie, unable to speak, managed a faint nod that Sophie Mae took for a yes  but Bertie really 
meant as a signal for help as his head was the only part of his anatomy that was able to move.  Sophie Mae, encouraged by his assent, flung herself onto the bed beside Bertie and Petunia just as Kix walked through the door to see if perhaps Bertie wanted to press charges against one or both of the Flakers. 
<p>
"Hayl's bales!" exclaimed Kix. "It's one a them menagerie-a-troys I heard about but ain't never seen in action before!   I had you figgered all along for one a them pre-verts, Mr. Lindamood and I see I wuz right! Takin advantage of a innocent gal and her pig! You ort to be ashamed!"
<p>
Petunia, sensing that her owner and her new-found friend were being threatened, leaped from the bed and butted Kix with enough force to propel him back through the bedroom door, through the house, down the steps, and into the side of Flammie's Caddy with enough force to put a slight dent in the left front fender.
