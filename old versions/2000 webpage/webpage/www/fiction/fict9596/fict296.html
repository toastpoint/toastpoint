If you are inspired to write a sequel paragraph to an entry, feel free.  
We could end up with a multi-hypertexted novel from hell!  Until I can 
figure out how to make the forms do this, specify which author's 
paragraph you are continuing.

Mariah Ramsey</a> begins a 
Harlequin Romance 2/27</h3>

As Rosanna stared at the boy who had been her friend forever, her heart beat
madly and yet she had no idea why.  When his hand touched hers, she jumped 
suddenly, giving Ryan reason to question her behavior.  He gave her a weird
look as to ask why such a reaction.  She quickly covered her feelings and 
smiled letting him know that everything was fine.
<p>
Then all of a sudden, Rosanna's feelings became too overwhelming for her and
she bolted from the secluded corner in the restaurant.  Ryan yelled out to 
her but it was too late - she had already zoomed out of the parking lot in her
new red convertible.
<p>
While Rosanna drove, she tried to sort out what she was feeling inside.  On
one hand she cared for Ryan as the friend that would always be there for her.
On the other, she felt a spark ignite in her every time his hand touched hers.
She had to decide right here and now if she wanted to act on these feelings.
<p>
This was the sure sign that Rosanna had grown up in so many ways.  No longer
that young, sometimes daring girl who loved sports and being a tomboy.  Now
she was a beautiful young woman who at the tender age of seventeen felt deep
meaningful feelings of love.  She could either act on these feelings and risk
losing the friendship of her best friend, or keep them hidden making herself
miserable and eventually probably losing him as a friend still.  Rosanna knew
what had to be done and she decided that today would be the day.

<h3>Conan the Librarian begins a 
Victorian novel 2/22</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
I should have been alerted at once by the stained glass door.  After all,
it occurred to me later, castles don't typically have stained glass doors.
The doors of castles are heavy, solid wood, the better to resist attackers.  
The stained glass door of Castle Windvere meant that the builders
of this castle were well aware that NOBODY WANTED TO GET IN.  If only I 
had realized this in time!

Erk</a> begins a 
Nancy Drew novel 2/19</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane of
hair, Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and barked with her
trademark raucous, sneering laughter - laughter known to have unmanned many
a suitor.  
Twyla basked in the rampant sexuality that oozed out of every pore, reveling
in the assorted people whose eyes followed her like burning suns.  Unmanned
suitors lay in her wake, gasping for air like beached trout.  Twyla took
a deep toke from her joint, feeling every limb relax into a torpid sensuality.  
She glanced down at her halter top and panted slightly, letting her head
roll back. Several nubile young gentlemen, their eyes flaming uncontrollably
with need, moved closer. One reached out and gently fondled her...
<p>
"NAANCY" screamed a high, whiny voice.  Nancy gasped.  
Her clothes lay strewn about
the room, thrown every which way as she had abandoned herself to her lurid,
hot fantasy.  Snatching bras and polo shirts alike, Nancy threw herself into
her clothes, thinking feverishly of cold showers. 
<p>
"NNAAAAAN-CEEE" whined George from outside the door, "Ned's ready to go
bowling. I wanna go bowling! What are you doing?"
<p>
"Uh....thinking about that mysterious disappearance of the bar singer. I
must solve that crime!" said Nancy determindly, as she put on her corduroy
slacks.  Adjusting her trademark pencil protector, Nancy combed back her hair
into a prim bun and laughed with her trademark whiny, self-congratulatory
snicker - a sound known to have solved many a crime.

C.C.</a> begins a 
Science Fiction novel 2/17</h3>
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
The sights that beheld me inside were shocking.  I could not believe 
that I had even stepped in this bleak place, but there was no turning back now.  
I had to stay here against my will.  I could not have begun to 
venture back out into the unknown of this strange place - 
I had to stay the night.  <p>
I could not sleep.  My 
heart was pounding through my chest, terror was running through my mind, 
and fear was eating at my soul.  Somehow I must have fallen asleep 
because when I looked around, it was day time again.  The castle did
not seen nearly as terrifying as it did last night.  
There was no way to tell where I was since I had been 
disoriented the night before.  Suddenly a loud screech rang out from a 
room above me.  I began to 
struggle to find a way out, but it was too late.  I had nowhere to run.  
My life suddenly flashed before my 
eyes and then it was over.

Sam</a> begins a 
Mystery novel 2/15</h3>
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I would
never have entered the gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
I stepped into the darkness.  A thump was heard as a creature swooped out of 
nowhere and pulled me into the dark misty air.  
"What have I done!" cried I.  I threw myself on top of the winged creature, 
pulled out my dagger and pushed right into its center.  
A horrible scream was heard and then ...

The Young One</a> begins a 
"Distilled Water on Tap" novel 2/14</h3>

With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through
butter, or a spoon through jello.  
His back arched with uncanny flexibillity.  He twisted his torso in 
unfathomable ways, as he 
flowed through the pipes.  He had to find his wedding ring!  
How could he have been so stupid as
to let it fall in the toilet?  And then flush?  Well what was done was 
done, and now, it had 
to be undone. 
<p>
Joel came to a halt at a intersection of rusty piping.  He would have to 
call a plumber soon,
before they burst.  Trying to decide which way to turn, he looked down 
the pipe on his left.  He 
could faintly smell the septic tank.  "No, better not go that way.", he 
thought.  To the right, there 
was a dim light.  That must be the ocean!  
<p>
Seeing no better way to go, Joel traveled forward.  He soon reached the 
wedding ring.  He fit 
it around his waist and started back to the toilet.  As he neared the 
opening of the tank, there 
was an oninous flushing noise.  A great torrent of water ran upon him 
like a tital wave.  "Ahhhhh," 
he screamed as he was washed down the pipes and out to the ocean.

Hikeeba</a> begins a Science Fiction novel 2/14</h3>
The accidental, fleeting touch of his hand filled me with loathing.  
Like cheap gift wrap, it crackled with the merest movement.  
I forced my eyes away from the grey/blue flesh draped over the fragile 
bones and verdant green pulsing rapidly beneath the translucent surface.  
When curiousity and revulsion drew my eyes upward to that awful face, 
I sent a silent curse to the Interspecies Dating Agency.

<h3>Anonymous begins a Western 2/13</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through
butter, or a spoon through jello.  
Unfortunately, he had chosen to plunge into a shallow puddle rather than the
lake, so his dive was cut bone-wrenchingly short as his spine bent in twelve 
different directions.  
 "Good thing I am Gumby-Jello-Butter-Man(TM)!" cried Joel, as he richocheted
back up through the trees. "Otherwise some very fine similies would have gone 
to waste!" Sailing through the air like a bird on a current - or a paper airplane
in a dream - Joel thought bemusedly of how he had been transformed from an
ordinary human to Gumby-Jello-Butter-Man(TM). It had all started when he had
driven off the Golden Gate Bridge...like a man driven, screaming, to the depths 
of deepest, darkest despair, to commit a sin which damned his soul to burn
forever. Or a Hell's Angel on drugs, exhilarated by the thrill of speed. Whatever.
<p>
When he woke up in the hospital with his green, elastic skin - like the top 
of a pudding, or the spirit of coagalated margarine - he shrieked "MY GOD...WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE...."  And the demons of the underword hissed delightedly at his pain...

King of SynchroniCity </a> begins an Experimental 
novel 2/7</h3>
Glittering nousnaut wirkende crafts spiraled thru the THINking
PLANiT NOUS and landed in SynchroniCity.
<p>
Under the scrutiny of the recording angels nousnauts had been
instructed to log in "coincidences."
<p>
If we can get inside one of their nousnaut wirkende crafts, we
would be able to find out how they actually orbited around 
SynchroniCity, capitol of coincidences.
<p>
I wanted to find out, so somehow I snuck on.   After a while, 
they didn't even care if I was an invisible stowaway.  They
assumed that because I had the same thing in mind (to help save
the planet Earth from inevitable suicide and to help save the
State of Sy Koid) they simply shrugged and continued their work.
<p>
Wow!  We swooshed above the noospheres, the thinking layer that
enveloped the planet Earth and I was compelled to write down
a lot of the coincidences.  
<p>
As a matter of fact, their crusades involved a kinship connection
that spanned the entire creation of the time-place scroll.  So
some of the places that we visited seemed to be mirrored
representations of the same motifs over and over.
<p>
In any case, one of my stations meant working with the thought
police at the borders between the CU and the CC.
<p>
Sometimes I just wrote down what I thought they were saying, like<p>
"WATT INDIA BAGDAD< UZNO WATT AMIN.  ANDROPEV STALIN.  UZNO
WATT AMIN 007 SOUL CORE."
<p>
"WATT?"
<p>
"UZNO WATT AMIN."

<h3>Tica begins a Horror novel 2/4</h3>
"Life's tough in this town", Marley thought, wincing as he labored to 
extract the bullet fragment from his thigh.  
The Cats had found him while he sat in the gay bar.  He had only gone 
there to look at him.  Him,  the man with a body to die for and a face.  
What a face.  He cried out, not from the gunshot wound but from the 
memory of that beautiful face.  <p>
It was dark in the alley.  Stealthy footsteps around the corner became 
louder as his suitor approached him.  Run, run you fool.  You can't stay 
here, the cats will find you.  A car splashed down the street behind him.  
Someone shouted an obsenity and he took the moment to run again.  
There under the light, beside a stinking can full of forgotted decay 
awaited his pursuer.  Damn the luck.  Jeffrey, that misbegotten 
offspring of a cajun cat, had found his match.  The Persian yeowled as 
she jumped onto his back.  In a moment of exquisite feline 
passion the deed was done.  In two months Jeffey would really have kittens.

<h3>Esme Vermiform begins a Gothic novel 2/1</h3>
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I would
never have entered the gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
But the letter had intrigued me and since Alice's untimely demise, I had 
been at a loss for something to do.  Her estate left me quite comfortable 
for the first time in my life, ready to pursue my passion of pornographic 
etchings, and when M______'s invitation arrived, it seemed just the 
diversion I needed.
