If you are inspired to write a sequel paragraph to an entry, feel
free.  
We could end up with a multi-hypertexted novel from hell!  Until
I can 
figure out how to make the forms do this, specify which author's 
paragraph you are continuing.

<h3>Tex Hardrider begins a Western 4/30</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The house had lain dormant for decades, perched there on Coogan's Bluff.  
Nothing had disturbed its slumber since the burning time.  Nothing but the 
wind stirring the shutters where Miss Molly had carved her notches so 
many years ago.  Molly was a wild 'un and sure didn't fit this town's 
notion of what a lady ought to be.  She broke in that mean old horse 
at 15 and me at 16 and I didn't see much difference in her technique.   
No siree, she sure wern't no lady.  "Do what ya' please," was her 
motto and she applied it particularily to the married men in town.   
One day after the Sunday service, the wives finally swapped notes and 
decided they'd had enough of Miss Molly.  After sleeping with the mayor 
that afternoon, she carved her last notch in the shutter.  That very night, 
someone set fire to Molly's house and that was the end of her.  Everyone 
said she'd get burned one day for what she did, but I sure do miss her.  
Those were the good old days, before the burning time.

<h3>Narfy begins a Comedy novel 4/30</h3>
Suddenly there was a tremendous explosion and the back of the ship flew half a 
mile in a southerly direction.  "Damn" thought Fred, "Too much dynamite".  
Where the safe had once been there was now a gaping hole, lots of water and the 
odd dead fish.  Fred jumped into the water as the ship sank underneath him.  
"God, I hate the water" he thought as he struggled to keep his head above the 
water.  As he slowly sunk, he slowly became unconscious.
<p>
Fred awoke to find himself in a beautiful paradise.  Birds of paradise sang in 
the trees, exotic plants bloomed before him, natives loomed with spears and 
cooking pot in hand, the waves lapped upon the..........
<p>
"Hmph" thought Fred as he recapped what he just saw.  Birds of paradise, 
beautiful flowers, angry natives, That's the odd one out......
AARRGGHH!!!!!!!!!"  Fred ran like a scalded cat along the beach.  
It wasn't long before he was boiling
quite happily in the pot.  
<p>
Drums beat away in the background. Fred thought now would be a good 
opportunity to have a bath.  "I say, old chap, have you got a bar of soap?" 
he said to a nearby native.  The native wondered which language he was 
speaking. "UM" he replied.  Fred repeated his sentence and was quickly made a god!!!!!!!!!!

Samantha Love</a> begins a 
Harlequin Romance novel 4/3</h3>
With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through
butter, or a spoon through jello.  
He swam with anger, all the anger he had built up since he found out that 
Bambi was cheating on him. The anger fueled him, allowing him to swim the
best he'd ever swam, winning the race. But that didn't matter to him.  All
that mattered to him was Bambi. He loved her so much, he couldn't live 
without her. He couldn't stop thinking about her long flowing hair that
rested on her shoulders. Or her creamy skin that he loved to touch and
kiss. But now she was gone, for she had found another. Joel was so crushed
when he found out, his heart broke into a thousand pieces and he vowed he'd
never love another. The whole experience had damaged him so badly because
he didn't hear about her cheating on him - he'd walked in on her and his
cousin, Susan!

ERCS</a> begins a 
Baby-Sitter's Club novel 4/3</h3>
Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane of
hair, Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and barked with her
trademark raucous, sneering laughter - laughter known to have unmanned many
a suitor.  
"Oh no!" Kristy cried as she put her hand to her face, 
"You can't wear that to the town social!"  Kristy was the leader of the 
Babysitter's club. Thyla pulled her black leather skirt down and 
confronted the pathetic, little girl. "Kristy...." she began, 
"You have a lot to learn."  Thyla pulled a gun out of her shirt and 
pointed it at the stunned and shaking Kristy.  A smile spread across 
Thyla's face as she listened carefully and saw the liquid seeping down 
Kristy's leg.

Moxy Tang</a> begins a 
silly smut novel 4/3</h3>
"Oh, fudge", Mary cried as her roadster sputtered to the curbside.  
"My radiator is leaking", the attractive slender young woman realized, 
"and I'll never get to the hop in time to meet Stan!".  
But Mary didn't count on a guardian angel coming to her rescue.  
She definitely didn't count on a 6 foot 2 inch angel with dark wavy hair 
greased back over his ears and dreamy green eyes that made her weak in 
the knees.  "Hi,"  Mary said tentatively, not sure if she should talk to 
this intriguing stranger.  
<p>
He didn't answer.  Instead he leaned under the hood of her pale blue roadster.  
Mary barely fought her urge to glance at his form as he leaned over.  
This simply wouldn't do!  She had to get herself together before the hop!  
Wait a minute - Mary jumped as she heard the stranger's motorcycle 
take off down the highway.  Oh well, it was probably better this way.  
Mary had to hurry if she was going to meet Sam at the hop.  Dependable, 
predictable Sam.

<h3><a href=mailto:mozart@erinet.com>Brandy</a> 
begins a Mystery novel 4/1</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I
would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors. 
The entry hall lead up some stone steps which I climbed, 
listening to the wheezing of my breath, trying not to turn
and run away. Down another long hall I approached a pair of heavy oak doors. 
Pulling on the ring, I realized my strength
was too feeble. One lone mouse crept along the damp wall and slipt 
under the heavy door. I wondered how many more of his relatives were 
wandering freely in this massive stone fortress. 
<p>
I had inherited it from my uncle Percy. 
Oh, why had I felt sorry for the old geezer
and sent him the only Christmas card he had received in twenty years! 
I swear I'll never try to do another nice thing for anyone 
ever again...
<p>
My heart races as I hear footsteps climbing the stone steps. 
Who...Where.. what..I become panicked and 
wonder which way would I should run.  
In one last attempt I pull the ring to the oak doors and 
I can't believe what I see.

Shoshana Wallace</a> begins a 
Horror novel 4/1</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Had I but known the ancient, dank history of Castle Windvere, I
would
never have entered gaping maw of its stained glass front doors.  
But, Rhett said it didn't matter where we made our first home. 
He took my hand 
and helped me up the long, winding staircase. 
"I think this is it." he said as we came to the master bedroom. 
I nodded, and 
walked in the door. I sat down on the bed, and leaned back. 
There was someone else in the bed with me! 
<p>
I couldn't believe it. I began to scream, but nothing escaped my lips. 
I hurriedly looked all around, but Rhett was nowhere to be found. 
In his place was a giant pink bunny with jaws of terror!
