Slowly, achingly, inexorably, the sun's tendrils crept tentatively over the
yawning city with pussy-footed stealth.  
It was time for Brian, an extremely paranoid schizophrenic, to get up and face the world. Brian stared in the mirror of his small bathroom and realized that it had been a while since he had last shaved. He pulled on the fur that was almost touching his collar bone and yawned. Today was the day! He was going to actually leave the apartment and go out for breakfast. As Brian dressed himself in his favorite pink dress, terrorizing thoughts raced through his mind. What if when he got to the place he didn't like any of the food? What if he sees the person that served him food wasn't wearing rubber gloves? What if there's a drive by shooting just as we walks out of the apartment? What if the sun suddenly blots out and the entire earth freezes while he's stuck in the middle of the city? What if he orders a plate of hash browns and there isn't any ketchup?!!!!! Brian bagan to breathe through a paper bag as he took that giant step and pulled the door to his apartment open. He walked down the street, panicki
ng, sweating and ready to run back to his home where he can sit comfortably and stare at his ceiling. But no, he HAD to do this! He had to prove to himself that he can go to a nice little place with food and actually eat. He finally chose  place. Brian turned a corner on Groton Ave and pushed he glass door open. A woman stared at him from behind the service counter and forced herself to smile. "Can I help you?" she stopped smiling when she realized that Brian was about to spew. He shook  his head wildly and walked further into the store, doing laps around the racks for at least two hours. He suddenly stopped and looked at what was on the racks. There were shelves of movies! Movies he hadn't seen, either! "Teminator Two", he sounded out loud. He smiled at the woman who approached him. "Wow!" he exclaimed, "This must be a new one!". The woman wasn't impressed with poor Brian. "Excuse me,Sir" she folded her arms, "but do you plan on renting a movie or are you just going to stand here all day? Isn't there anythin
g I can get you?" Brian held his breath, listening to his heart pound and nearly passing out. But he HAD to ask - for his own good! "YES!" He finally blurted out, "Do you have any... any.... Dough

MOS-31C</a> begins a Mystery 5/30</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The house had lain dormant for decades, perched there on Coogan's Bluff. Nothing had disturbed its
slumber since the burning time. 
Then on a hot summer day in July a group of kids decided to venture up to the house to have some fun or so they thought. Little Timmy pushed on the door watching as it slowly opened. The boys saw cobwebs, furniture with old sheets on them and pictures that had strange people on them as they walked in to the room. As they walked in to the next room they saw what appeared to be a trail of blood. As curious as all kids are they decided to follow the trail and see where it went. Walking through the next room they could hear the sound of a creature behind the door in the next room. The kids, now being very stupid, decided to go ever so close to the door to see what creature was. As the kids got closer could hear heavy breathing, then there was a roar. The kids, now scared, ran towards the door to get away and get help. There were almost to the door when it slammed shut trapping the boys and with a few loud cries for help and a spine ttingling roar the house on Coogan's Bluff was quiet once again.

Gleech checked his radial circuitry one last time before shutting the hatch. Ionizing radiation in this part of
the Uncharted Zone was playing havoc with his motor skills, and occasionally caused a brief hallucination to
flash through his otherwise logical brain paths. <p>
  Gleeck was the type of robot that everyone loved.  
His shiny chrome exterior with the intellect of a super-human computer at 
his beck and call.  What was it all worth?  
What was he really meant to do in this vast vacuum with some dust and 
accumulated rock here and there?  
Everyone got along with Gleech, but somehow that wasn't enough.  
He longed to go explore different galaxies and rule over any 
unsuspecting mediocrity of a society.  
<p>
As he set off on his way, he decided that he must 
leave and search out his destiny.  After much travelling, he 
came upon a tiny solar system.  In this system there was a particularly 
beautiful planet.  He decided to go and see what it was like a 
little more.  He finally came to the conclusion that these "people" would 
be a good kind to overpower.  He would start his plot to take over the 
universe with this tiny insignificant piece of dust.  He was now on his way to becoming the greatest ruler of the universe time has ever known, at least until time had come.

<h3>Norman D. Plume begins a Mystery 5/30/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Chance Diceland, cunning purveyor of useless information and insignificant pencil pusher from building 4G - 4th floor, heaved a heavy sigh as he stared at the arduous task before him. Today, by no fault of his own, he is forced to employ his pedals and ascend four flights of stair in order to reach his turret prison of an office. Normally, Chance would make use of his digits and punch in the well worn '4' button in the elevator, but today...the body, the blood, the unspeakable. The once animate corpse of his co-worker, Norma Truffles, had been found at the base of the elevator shaft, closing off all operations and opening up a full scale investigation - The only visible clue appearing to be the shaved eyebrows of the victim. Now Chance's office was crawling with police and detectives and he worriedly wondered how he would pursue his daily illegal internet habits without arousing suspicions.

<h3>Peter Robbins begins a <a name="flea">Fantasy Novel</a> 5/30</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The morning broke slowly, gentle light filtering through the curtain of the
world, not yet bright enough to wake the host, at whose flews Pulin'dra
drank long and deeply. "Today," she thought. "Today will be the day I leap to
the goddess. I have led a long and prosperous life, since moulting to
adulthood, and leaping from the old host to the new. My offspring are
numerous like the sands, and my host is aged enough, so as not to be able
to shake us free. The goddess of the world chooses to let us inhabit our
host, and for that, we worship her. But today, I will sacrifice all, and
jump to the goddess to die."<p>
Her reveries at the flews were cut short, as a rumble announced the
presence of the goddess, and Pulin'dra looked up to watch, as, yet again,
the arm of the goddess drew back the curtain of the world, warming the
host. As she flexed her coxae, anticipating the jump that would take her
from the host forever, her son-mate Pulin'cha of the third birthing
approached her, flicking his clypeal tubercle in homage. 'Mother-wife,' he
began, turning a profile towards her, so she might see more of him, 'the
brood needs you. They are starving in the host-ear, since the night of the
deep-washing cleansed all the wax-food away. Unless we bring them more
cast-off moulting skins, and frass, they will starve.'. Pulin'dra sighed,
feeling the pressure beginning to build between her pronotum and
mesopleuron, as it had been wont to do, these last days since the poison
bath had taken nearly half her spawn.
<p>

The journey to the host-ear was one, that at this time, so soon after 
the drawing back of the curtain of the world, was fraught with peril.  As 
Pulin'dra and her son-mate Pulin'cha passed from the slavering flews of
drinking, the host began the ritual passage to the vast mirrors, two shining
pits, which contained the sustenance of the host, but only death for 
Pulin'dra's people, should they ever be foolhardy enough to tempt the fates
and leap.  Since the birth of her first spawn, Pulin'dra had passed on the 
lore of the mirrors, trying desperately to keep her  brood from following
the uncanny pull of the mirrors and jumping to their doom.  Some listened,
staying with their mother, to inbreed, and make the clan stronger, while
others followed the call of the mirrors, culling their own weakness from
the bloodlines.
<p>
<h3>F. Lee Marquet <a name="flea3">continues</a> 5/31</h3>
As Pulin'dra stepped up to the host-eye of weeping, Pulin'cha stopped her 
with a brush of his labial palps against her tergal bristles.  'Stop for a 
moment, mother-mate, while I admire you among the host-eye encrustations. 
You were always at your best amongst the flakes'  Pulin'dra would have 
coloured, had not the horny cuticle of her exoskeleton been jet-black 
already. 'We have no time for frolic, son-mate' she began, 'You have been 
too much aroused since you reappeared after your leap from the host three 
cycles ago.'
<p>
Suddenly she turned to face her son, 'Pulin'cha, Pasteurella pestis' she 
cursed, 'Have you drunk from a new host? Have you supped upon the blood of 
another?' Her three piercing stylets vibrated with anger, 
'If you jeopardize our clan by your wanderings, we will force you to jump 
to the mirrors!'

Flicking her cigarette contemptuously and tossing her thick mane of hair, 
Thyla adjusted the straps of her halter top and
barked with her trademark raucous, sneering laughter - 
laughter known to have unmanned many a suitor.  
She looked around and saw that no one was paying much attention to her. 
Thyla grew angry and walked up to the first man she saw. 
He was short, bald, and overweight. "This is gonna be fun,' she thought. 
She grabbed his shiny head and rubbed it against her ample bosom. 
The man squirmed from the lack of oxygen. 
Thyla kept him there until finally, he stoppped moving. 
She unhanded him and he fell to the floor dead. 
Thyla laughed and grabbed another victim. 
He too was smothered in her breasts of terror. 
Thyla was known for knocking 'em dead, but this was ridiculous.

Slowly, achingly, inexorably, the sun's tendrils crept tentatively over the yawning city with pussy-footed stealth. 
  Roger Rodrieguez shifted his HovR into seventh gear as he flew vertical 
around the nearby skyscraper, causing the glass and steel fortress to 
vibrate under the stress of his transport's nullfield. A red light flashed 
on and a warning beep sounded.<BR>
<BR>
"Master Rodrieguez," a cybernated feminine voice cooed from the internal 
speakers, "you are red-lining. Please kindly return the HovR-97 Transport 
to an upright, horizontal position to insure a safe enjoyable ride."<BR>
<BR>
"Put a disk in it pooter!" Roger blasted, "I'm enjoyin'! I'm enjoyin'!"<BR>
<BR>
After a full 180 turn around the skyscraper, Roger peeled off in a cartwheel 
formation which caused a few more warning lights and beeps, and then 
bounced the nullfield down into the used dealership. He parked the HovR, 
flicked the door panel and hopped out.<BR>
<BR>
"Whoo, Suit! Relate access to my stylin'! Think I'll download this 
hardware to my harddrive!"<BR>
<BR>
"I take it that means you like it?" Sidney Feldermeyer was a used HovR 
salesman who dealt with young people daily. He was beginning to get the 
hang of this generation's slang talk, having worked for HovR Transport 
International's Second Life Service Department for almost twelve years. 
They tended to see life the way they saw their computer, which was 
understandable because for many of them that was all they had. "All I 
need young man is your thumbprint and retinal scan and I can file all the 
necessary textfiles. Then you can take her home."<BR>
<BR>
"Sorry, Suit. Can't scan me. I'm clicking on this link and there's 
nuthin' you can do about it." Roger pulled out a semi-automatic weapon, 
one of the kinds which had been outlawed almost three years ago, not that 
it stopped them being sold in the black market, but Sydney wasn't concerned 
about the legalities of it at the time. He was too busy seeing a barrell 
aimed at his temple. "Think I'll download all the dead leaves in yer 
stronghold too, if you can access my program."<BR>
<BR>
"Uh, you want the money in the safe?"<BR>
<BR>
"Electric! You speak my code, Suit! Now let's get the bandwidth charged to 
the northeast."

begins a Mystery 5/22</h3>
"Oh, fudge", Mary cried as her roadster sputtered to the curbside. "My radiator is leaking", the attractive slender young
woman realized, "and I'll never get to the hop in time to meet Stan!...I'll never get to the hop in time...
<p>
Mary's eyes opened wide as she stared
blankly at the crack in the ceiling. Three nights in a row, the same dream....
something always keeping her from getting to the hop with Stan...   She reached
for a cigarette to only find an empty pack which she crumbled in her hand and 
tossed against the wall.  She recollected her thoughts, threw on some lipstick
and was out the door. The sound of her boots clicking as she walked echoed
 down the empty hallway. 
<p>
She fumbled for her car keys as she nearly stumbled
over what appeared to be a rather odd-looking trinket..perhaps a carnival
novelty from days gone by. Mary knelt down to pick up the rather tarnished 
trinket. It was a clown keychain, perhaps from the early fifties..the blues
reds and yellows so faded it made the clown's expression almost look cynical.  
"Why I'll name you Clarence", she thought to herself, and she threw her newfound 
Clarence in her purse as she continued on down the hallway.
<p>
As Mary left the building, she couldn't help but to notice a rather large man 
peering at her from across the street.  She didn't bother to give it a second 
thought or a second glance. The sun was reflecting off her red hair and 
she brushed it aside with her hand.
<p>
This man had been watching Mary for the past week. He knew her basic schedule
which did not consist of too much more than going out for cigarettes, alcohol
and cat food. He had seen who went in and out of her place, and how long they had 
been there. What this man did not know was that Mary had just acquired a new
friend. A friend she calls Clarence.
<p>
Mary returned to her apartment, cigarettes,having been the object of her
most recent endeavour. She couldn't help but notice a rather odd smell that
seemed to be lingering around the room. She laughed to herself "I must be
 going nuts...I'm sure I smell cotton candy"..as she laughed, she didn't 
realize..that someone else was laughing with her..someone named Clarence...
<p>
"WHAM WHAM WHAM" , the whole wall shook, who the hell was banging on the door?
Mary ran to the door, threw it open and there stood the man.  "I am Stan - 
I am here to take you away". "Take me away, take me away from what?", said Mary.
"What the hell are you talking about and why were you banging on my door?  
ARE YOU CRAZY"...  He pushed himself in through the door, his hand over her mouth.
Mary, kicking, hysterically trying to push this man away...  "Listen to me",
he said - "You are in danger"...  the scent of cotton candy filled the room, filling
every inch of the room...the smell of popcorn oozing out from every corner
what was happening..circus music louder and louder...her head was spinning.
."WHAT WAS HAPPENING"...then it all stopped all stopped..the scent of popcorn
..the cotton candy...Alex.."What is going on"...she reached for her purse..
scrambling..dumping out the contents..it was gone..Clarence was gone....
Mary reached for her cigarettes..only to find an empty pack...

With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through butter, or a spoon through jello.  
He could feel the sweltering sun against his mighty amazonian back.  He wasn't hot, he was melting into Crystal Lake like the first kiss of a twelve-year old.  Slowly, he slapped his hands on Tina's thighs, which glistened like strawberry syrup.  She cried out and screamed, " What's that Joel?  Is it...what I think it is?"  With swift ease, Joel wrapped his steel arms around Tina.  He stared across the lake and saw it.  The dreaded sea-slimer.  It rose aobve them, wavering like it had a mind of its own.  With mouths agape, Joel and Tina watched in horror as the slimy mass ascended the sky and blocked out the celestial sun from their view.  Joel looked toward Tina and said, "Honey, pumpkin, did you mind swimming ashore?   Tina looked at Joel with pleading blue eyes.  As she stepped off the bow and fell into the thrashing water, Joel waved and covered his mouth.  He tried not to scream as he saw the slimey mass tug at her legs and finally pull her under with one last scream from her bosom.  At last, 
Joel fell back against the boat and yelled with his arms wavering in the air, "Why me?  Why me?

"With one swift dive, Joel cut the water like a knife through butter, or a spoon through jello.  That is in a squishy, wiggly sort of way, for at 650 lbs. Joel was now a squishy, sort of wiggly guy. "

begins a Science Fiction novel 5/1</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
As Alpha-Beta twelve was carted to the recycler, he couldn't help but think
of all the people he had touched with his jaunt in the world of emotion. If
he had had tear ducts he would have cried, but his programmers had not 
reckoned on his acheiving the level of awareness that he had. 
<p>	To love! That was his dream, and he felt the anguish of lost love as the 
grinding, chrushing manipulators were brought closer to his mettallic body.
He found himself speculating as to why he had come to this, why him out of
all the other robots at Factory 12-Beta on Gaeledaes 12-Delta-Gamma-47 had
gained the power to love - what a blessing, and what a curse! He felt like
Asskin when he was burned by the Gaandelians on Hamfrom-12-Oskleese, dying
for his beloved Raaanb, but because he has been of the Raalx and she of the
Graaamz, their love was forbidden. 
</p><p>	Alpha-Beta's foot entered the machine, but because it was constructed of 
metal, he felt no pain. He had never felt pain, but for the pain of a broken
heart. The factory ForeBeing, Alidia, a human, had caught his eye once during
a late shift. Her lovely, Detalian Red hair glowed flourescent orange
in the light of the fusion coils. In fact, it had been at this very part of 
the factory that he had proposed to her. It had been a warm night, and the
thirty-seven moons reflected the light of the binary suns with exquisite
beauty, almost as beautiful as the drip of cooling iron from the sides of 
the melting vat. Oh, how he had loved her.
</p><p>	Now the gears of the Destroyer ground his chest, and what would have been 
his heart, had he been human. Though it was not there, he felt the pain.
Oh the pain of a broken heart! That night, Alidia looked deep into his
chromium eyes, and told him that, though she felt a desire deeper than the 
seas of GGS-Alpha-4, she could never marry him because she would lose her job,
her apartment, and most probably her life for crossing the barriers between
man and machine.
</p><p>	Now the grinders had reached his head, and Alpha finally surrendered himself
to the death he was facing, hoping that he and his love would be reunited
in the silicon chips of heaven. As his eyes were extracted for reusal, the 
recycler scanners picked up unexplained moisture dripping from the 
optical sockets.
