"Goddammit, Petunia", Sofie Mae snarled at her prize hog, "Ah tol' you not to knock over that trough agin".   Sighing, she carefully opened the door to the pen, swatting Petunia on the snout to prevent her from getting out yet again.  "Ah swear, for a pig who's got it made, you sure are an ornery bitch."  The pig snorted a reply and resumed her eying of the now thrice-replaced gate.  Petunia had been her cousin Floyd's prize hog, but he had sold it to her right before he left town, saying "Take care of mah baby, Sofie Mae".  Trouble was, Petunia didn't take kindly to her new quarters and took every chance to make that clear to Sofie Mae.<p>
A quick grunt and the trough was righted and filled with slop, though her exertions and the sounds of her boots in the muck masked the sound of Flem's Pink Cadillac (Flammie gave him the first one to replace his 1975 Dodge Dart when she won the second, the one with the wet bar, but his frequent attempts at removing the Mary Kay symbol from the rear window had only succeeded in creating a large blind spot).  However, his raspy cough behind her alerted her instantly.  "This day is getting more addled than a blind frog in a henhouse." she sighed, "Flem Flaker, what the HELL do you want?"
<p>
"Afternoon, Miz Sofie Mae", Flem leered.  "Lookin' mighty pretty today".
<p>
"Shut up, you horse's ass!  I'm standing knee-deep in pig-plop!"
<p>
Flem coughed at the sinful word, but recovered.  "I've come to bring you back into the fold, Sofie Mae - we-all miss ya at church an' all, and you'll find yourself doing the DEVIL'S work if you're not careful..."
<p>
Sofie Mae snorted as she watched Petunia finish the slop with a satisfied snort.  "I ain't comin' back to that collection of lunatics you call parishioners ever!  Not after what happened!"
<p>
Flem, having noticed Sofie Mae's laced blouse becoming undone with her exertions, decided to brave the inside of the pen.  Opening the pen door, his voice dripping with syrup, he began his approach, "Now, Sofie Mae, you <em>know</em> that was not..."
<p>
Before Flem could finish, he found himself sailing through the air, propelled by an escaping hog.  Making a two-point landing in dung with his backside, as Petunia made her move, he also found himself getting kicked by a furious Sofie Mae.  "You goddamn fool!", she cried as she chased the hog out of the pen, taking a second to kick Flem once more on the way out.  "Petunia, you bitch!  Come back here!"
<p>
Flem had never seen a hog run that fast.  As he squishily extricated himself from the muck, he was delighted as Sofie wheeled around, then stopped and reinserted her bosom into her blouse, lacing it up as she approached. "She's headed for Floyd's old place.  I never seen a pig liked her house so much.  C'mon, Flem, run me down there, you idiot."<p>
Meanwhile, a mystified, but polite Bertie Lindenwood was serving cookies to a vibrantly-glossed Flammie Flaker.
<p>

As Flammie politely took a fig newton between her carefully lacquered Lee
Press-on nails and, mindful of smearing her lipstick, delicately bit into
it, she murmured a breathy "Thank y'all" that  set Bertie's heart aflutter
with anticipation.<p>
        "Ms. Flaker, you're just the woman I've been searching for. I find
the sound of your voice very exciting!" he said, with what Flammie assumed
was desire - as indeed it was, but not quite the kind she imagined. "Wait
right here until I get what I need from the bedroom."<p>
        While thoughts of  seduction, conversion, sainthood, and fame
inflamed Flammie's brain, Bertie searched frantically for his tape recorder
and a few fresh cassettes. Flammie was indeed what he needed to launch his
study of the region's peculiar dialect, the better to prepare himself to
write the definitive study of what he'd taken the liberty of calling
"Hillbonics: The Grammar, Syntax, Vocabulary, and Pronunciation of West
Virginia Dialectical Variations as a Subset and/or Digression of the
Standard English Vernacular," the publication of which would establish his
integrity as a linguist, guarantee his appointment to a full professorship
at a prestigious Ivy League College, and impress his older brother who -as a
successful used-car salesman - was forever belittling Bertie's academic
interests.<p>
        As Flammie waited, her patience giving way to nervousness when
Bertie seemed to be taking an inordinate amount of time in the bedroom, she
ate the rest of the fig newtons and contemplated how best to begin the
seduction.  After unbuttoning the top three buttons of her blouse and
kicking off her shoes, she struck what she believed was a provocative pose
in the open doorway, the better for the sunlight to glint off her artfully
lacquered curls.<p>
        At that moment, Bertie - clutching his recorder - emerged from the
bedroom, gaped in Flammie's direction, and muttered, "Omigod!" with what
Flammie assumed was wild desire, but what was in reality a warning to
Flammie to move aside as an enormous hog raced across the porch and toward
the open door.  Not heeding the warning - indeed, not knowing it was a warning
to be heeded - Flammie was struck full force from behind by the desperate
Petunia and knocked into Bertie, who fell beneath Flammie as Petunia
galloped over them both and sought refuge under the bed.  When Flammie came
to, confused though she was, she was certain the earth had moved.  Seeing
Bertie beneath her, she thoughtfully asked, "Was it good for y'all, too?"
but Bertie, still unconscious, was not the one who replied, "In God's name,
Flammie, what have you done?!"<p>
        Flem, who had just now arrived with Sofie Mae and was already upset
about the pig poop damage to his upholstery, couldn't believe his eyes!
<p>

"Ah kin explain ever'thing, Flem honey," said Flammie, which she then
proceeded to do while Flem, pretending to listen, kept his eyes on Sophie
Mae who-Flem could see through the open bedroom door- was bent over trying
to coax Petunia out from under Bertie's bed, and Flem uttered an occasional
"Oh, God!" as he watched her up-turned derriere.
<p>
Meanwhile, perched on his deer stand back on Widow's Peak, Samuel M.
("Slam") Dunkin watched his brother Kix pilot the patrol car down the
precipitous  mountain road and reflected that his brother had all the
luck-an exciting job, a nice car that he didn't even have to make payments
on, and the affections of the widow Marvella Maypole. Slam, whose life had
been plagued by series of bad luck incidents, had never gotten over being
fired from his job as basketball coach by the Widow's Peak school board who
wanted to use the money they'd save by firing him to hire a math teacher.
Slam had tried to explain that most of the kids would never even have any
need for math-not having any money to count-but they'd always play
basketball, but the school board just wouldn't listen to reason. He still
bore a grudge against all the surviving members of the board-too bad about
Maynard Maypole's mysterious cave-in accident, Slam chuckled to himself-and
always kept his deer rifle loaded just in case he ran across any of the
rest of them.
<p>
Just then, Slam heard - or thought he heard - something crashing through the
trees on the north side of the peak. Suddenly, he recalled the stories Kix
used to tell him about the Peak's Pike, a giant ghost fish with a taste for
human flesh, that was rumored to rise from the lake and scale the peak
while looking for its next victim. Slam tried vainly to dismiss the image
from his mind-as a child, he always used to wet the bed when Kix told him
those stories long ago-but the tell-tale dampness creeping down his legs
told him that some things cannot be so easily dismissed.
<p>

Mar. 4 and 9</h3>
Trixie, who in post-coital bliss, had fallen asleep in the back
seat of 
the patrol car when Elmer snuck back in his mother's trailer, which
had started 
rocking strangely back and forth not soon before the car stopped
its own 
rocking, didn't wake up again until her father had almost reached
the foot 
of Widow's Peak.  "WhatnHAYL..." Kix muttered, then whipped the car
off the 
road into the gravel at the foot of Bertram Lindenwood's driveway,
narrowly 
missing the squalling Flakers and their side-by-side pink Cadillacs.
<p>
"What were you doin' with that city feller!?" bellowed Flem,
shaking Flammie 
with his excrement-encrusted hands and smearing her pink rayon
party dress 
(which looked curiously out-of-place anyway in the daytime).
<p>
"What were YOU doin' with that Sofie Mae woman, rollin' around in
her 
hog waller?  Let go of me, you filthy..." shrieked Flammie,
slapping Flem 
with all her might, sending Press-On Nails flying in every
direction.
<p>
"Here now..." drawled Kix, delighted to have stumbled upon a reason
to 
exert his authority as town guardian... "Both of you, up against
the car!  
That's right, spread 'em!"  
<p>
"Flem, you're gonna have to LICK this car clean..." muttered a
furious 
Flammie as she complied, livid at the filthy state of her
second-best 
caddy.
<p>
After a quick frisk, Kix soon had each Flaker handcuffed to a door
handle of their respective Caddys.  "What'n'hell are both of you
squallin' about.  Flem?"
<p>
"Well, I was visitin' Miss Sofie Mae, to get her to come back to
the church 'n' all, but her hog escaped and ran down here, 's this
place was Floyd's, y'see, and ..."  Silenced from an evil glare by
Flammie, Flem shut up.
<p>
"And you, Miss Flammie?"
<p>
"Well, I wuz here to discuss some things with Mr. Lindenwood..."
<p>
"In a party dress?"
<p>
Flammie looked frightened, then recovered.  "I spilled somethin' on
my jumper - this was the only thing I had in the house..."
<p>
Oblivious to the interrogation in progress in his driveway, Bertie
slowly came to.  With a groan, he got to his feet, not quite sure
what happened, and rose to investigate the noises in his bedroom. 
"Miss Flammie, are you in there?"
<p>
The late afternoon sun shone strongly through his bedroom window,
causing a Close-Encounters backlighting effect as Sofie Mae
appeared in his bedroom doorway before he could enter.  "Hi," she
drawled, "A'm Sofie Mae Strunk.  I'm your neighbor up the mountain. 
Can y'all help me get mah hog from under your bed?"
<p>
Bertie, no less stunned by the silhouetted beauty in his bedroom
doorway than by the concept of a farm animal under his bed, replied
with less than his usual articulation, "Ummm...OK..."
<p>
Noting that he still wasn't moving, Sofie gently guided him inside
the bedroom with her hand.  "Now you just grab the foot and lift it
up, and I'll poke Petunia out this with here broom."
<p>
In a daze, he stood staring at her.  Sofie jumped, realizing that
her blouse had become undone yet again, and actually blushed as she
realized that <em>this</em> gentleman was not your typical Widow's
Peak resident, and might actually be worth knowing.  Those kind
eyes - although they were still spinning like marbles...  "Come ON,
Mr...."
<p>
"Um, Lindenwood, but you can call me Bertie, um..., ma'am...."
<p>
"Well, come on, then, help me out!"  Sofie turned, blushing,
realizing that she'd been staring a bit back herself.
<p>

Bertie, taken with the authenticity of Sophie Mae's accent as well as the obvious authenticity of her twin peaks peeking provocatively from her bodice, was at that point willing to do anything Sophie bade him, so with an uncharacteristic (for him) strength, he seized the foot of the bed and lifted it high in the air while Sophie simultaneously smiled approvingly  and, with a grip mastered by hours of hog hauling, extricated the hiding hog who was nestled amongst the dust bunnies.   Seeing her hog was safe, Bertie lowered the bed, the resulting thud so startling Petunia that she flung herself upon Bertie  knocking up backward 
and breathless upon the bed. As the hog  snuggled onto his chest and snorted into his ear, Bertie found himself unable to move or even gasp for help. 
<p>
"Gosh-a-mighty, Mr. Lind - ah, Bertie, Ah ain't never seen Petunia cotton to a man like she does to y'all. I reckon she must be in heat," Sophie Mae exclaimed, feeling a bit in heat herself for the object of her hog's desire.  "Does y'all like hogs?" she inquired hopefully.<p>
Bertie, unable to speak, managed a faint nod that Sophie Mae took for a yes  but Bertie really 
meant as a signal for help as his head was the only part of his anatomy that was able to move.  Sophie Mae, encouraged by his assent, flung herself onto the bed beside Bertie and Petunia just as Kix walked through the door to see if perhaps Bertie wanted to press charges against one or both of the Flakers. 
<p>
"Hayl's bales!" exclaimed Kix. "It's one a them menagerie-a-troys I heard about but ain't never seen in action before!   I had you figgered all along for one a them pre-verts, Mr. Lindamood and I see I wuz right! Takin advantage of a innocent gal and her pig! You ort to be ashamed!"
<p>
Petunia, sensing that her owner and her new-found friend were being threatened, leaped from the bed and butted Kix with enough force to propel him back through the bedroom door, through the house, down the steps, and into the side of Flammie's Caddy with enough force to put a slight dent in the left front fender.
<p>

April 2</h3>

As Kix peeled himself from the fender, hoping that Flammie wouldn't notice the damage, he heard the radio in his squad car sputter. Reaching through the open window and grabbing the microphone, he whomped the radio twice with his hand and heard the frantic voice of his dispatcher, Ima June, as she yelled, "Yo, Kix, where you at? Eb Barkis from Eb and Flo's Cut Rate Funeral Parlor & All Night Diner been callin' off an' on for nigh 'bout a hour. Seems like somebody done brung in yore brother Slam's poor mangled body, and they said somethin' about maybe you ought to come down here and investigate, you bein' sheriff an' all, and maybe arrange for the funeral  as you bein' next of kin an' all, an' then Flo got on the line an' sez to tell you she made some fresh banana puddin' an' why don't you stop in after you done seein' about yore poor mangled dead brother an' she'll give you the next-of-kin discount special she's been 
runnin' this week!"
<p>
While Ima June paused to take a breath and probably file another fingernail, Kix hopped in the car and sped off, still not noticing his daughter hiding in the floor of the back seat. As he sped away, he could hear the Flakers yelling something, but he figured they'd be fine still handcuffed to their cars and it wasn't like he was gonna need either set of his cuffs for the next hour or so.
