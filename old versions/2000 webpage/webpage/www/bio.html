<hr>
No, I'm not 
Eric Peterson the <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu:80/users/ericp/">Mormon 
computer scientist in Maryland</a>, Eric Peterson the 
<a href=http://members.aol.com/eric9215>Christian singer/songwriter</a>, 
Eric Peterson the <a href="http://world.std.com/~EandL/">architect in Boston</a> 
or 
Eric Peterson the <a href=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/4994/index.html>
Canadian hovercraft enthusiast</a>.  I am <em>certainly</em> not Eric Royce 
Peterson, author of the incomprehensible <a href=http://www.stolaf.edu/people/petersoe/>
Royce's Page of Coolness</a>.  Nope.  
I'm Eric Peterson the tech writer/musician/big ol' fag in New York City.

<p>
I was born in Washington D.C. in 1964 and grew up in McLean, VA with my 
parents and older sister (me and Sam to the left, Mom and Dad to the right).   
Mom and Dad now are happily retired in Beaufort, SC and, in fact, Dad designed the 
library logo on his t-shirt there.  
Sam lived in Beaufort, too, with her fabulous spouse, but they both just moved 
to Texas, where the spouse's family resides.
<p>
I went to 
<a href=http://www.wm.edu/>college in Williamsburg, </a>, 
<a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">graduate school in Baltimore</a> and moved to Philadelphia for seven years.  
<p>
In 1991, I adopted a huge black fluffy thing named Leopold.

<p>
In 1994, I moved to Manhattan and instantly my life became 
much more stimulating.  Plus, I found a partner, so now I live in Queens with 
my <a href=wumpus.html>Wumpus</a>!  We are now officially engaged.  (In what?  Don't ask.)
<p>
Professionally I am a technical writer for a <a href=http://www.executech.com>small 
software company</a>, which just moved 
offices <em>and</em> got acquired by a <a href=http://www.merrillcorp.com>much bigger company</a>.  
So we're enjoying newfound pleasures like, um, direct deposit and voice mail.

<h3>Interests</h3>
Scattered thru the Toast Point page you will find many examples of 
what I'm interested in, but basically they are:
<dL>
<dt><h4>Music</h4>
<dd>Particularly performance - <a href=http://www.io.com/~rboerger/Hornfaq.html>French horn</a> is my major instrument, with 
voice and conducting not far behind.  I also play all brass instruments 
(except for trombone - can't get that slide thing to save my life), piano, bassoon, string bass, recorder and (at one 
point, but not now) clarinet and guitar - none of these necessarily very well.  I 
have a special fondness for chamber music and twentieth-century stuff.  
I listen to classical, folk, Broadway, 70's rock and some pop.<p>
Currently, most of my spare time is taken up with my appointment as 
the Interim Artistic Director (read Temporary Conductor) of the 
<a href=http://www.dorsai.org/~jazzbike/band3.htm>Rainbow Symphonic Winds of New York</a>, 
a gay community band now entering its 20th season.  Stay tuned for the news of whether the 
RSW has decided to keep me permanently...
<p>
I am also the hornist for The Metropolitan Winds, a woodwind quintet.  We used to exist 
solely for an annual week of concerts at the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.  But 
this year we have been much more active and will be presenting a concert series at the 
<a href=http://www.bloomingdalemusic.org/page2.html>Bloomingdale School of Music</a> in 
Manhattan.  The Met Winds will soon have its own promotional page up - check here for details.
<p>
<dt><h4>Theater</h4>
<dd>Haven't done much lately, but I love to act, and have also done off-stage 
stuff such as musical direction, stage management, sound and so on.  
Favorite roles include Bartolo in <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>, Bob in 
<em>Beyond Therapy</em> and Carl-Magnus in <em>A Little Night Music</em>. 
I also did my first Pish-Tush in a concert <i>Mikado</i> just last December.   
Wumpus and I go to <a href=http://www1.playbill.com/playbill/>Broadway shows</a> fairly frequently.
<dt><h4>Literature</h4>
<dd>I read a lot, particularly trashy stuff like murder mysteries.  Inhaled 
much science fiction during my formative years.  I also 
<a href=ponder.html>write</a> occasionally.  
</dl>
Plus computers (duh), movies, coffee ice cream, etc., etc.
