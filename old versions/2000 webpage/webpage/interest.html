<a name="advice"><h3>Advice:</h3>
For advice on any subject, large or small, ask the erudite 
<A HREF="http://www.grandiose.com">Sir Charles Grandiose</A>.
<hr>

<a name="alma"><h3>Alma Maters:</h3>
<i>"Hark the students' voices swelling, strong and true and clear..."</I>  <br>
Visit the virtual sites of my bright college days: <a href=http://www.wm.edu/>The College of William and
Mary</a> and <a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">Peabody Conservatory</a>.
<hr></a>

<a name="friends"><h3>Friends and Family:</h3>
<ul>
<li>My father edits the newsletter for 
<a href="http://www.serve.com/SECHUMLO/">The Secular Humanists of the Lowcountry</a>.  
He also designed the web page initially, but has passed it on to someone who is more into it.<li>
My old college roommate and HTML guru maintains the unusually rococo
<a href="http://www.grandiose.com/vance.html">Cul-de-Sac Briceland</a>.  
Very much worth visiting.  
<li>
Pay a visit to 
<a href="http://www.reed.edu/~harlowe/">Esther's La-La Land</a>, the virtual reality
of my bouncy young friend who was such a delightful host to us 
in <a href=travel/bayarea.html>San Francisco</a>.
<li>
<a href="http://wanda.pond.com/~stevecap/Welcome.htm">Steven Capsuto</a>, 
media historian extraordinaire has a great page with all sorts of literary and library-ish links.
<li>
Miss <a href=http://members.aol.com/bluefairy/>Alan Lutton</a> is another friend of mine from 
various directions in Philadelphia, most notably two-stepping.
<li>
Steven, Alan and I were all sucked into the maw (twice!) of an all-male reading of Claire Booth's <em>The Women</em>.  
This project came from the mind of the infinitely twisted <a href=http://www.mindspring.com/~cconnelly>Chris Connelly</a>.  
As I told him once, as he was quoting huge chunks of lyrics from <em>Coco</em>, 
"The rest of us are just trying to be faggots.  You're already there."
<li>
My buddies <a href=http://keck.ucsf.edu/~holder>Gaylord Holder</a> and 
Marianne Lipson (a spousal team) are 
bright and interesting persons, have cleverly given up Philadelphia for 
San Francisco, and on June 30, 1997, produced a little person named Campbell Hannegan 
Holder!  (Note: we got to <a href=travel/bayarea.html>visit them</a> over Memorial Day.)
<li>
Frequent <a href=fiction/fiction.html>Bad Fiction Contest</a> contributor 
Becky Mushko writes the <em>Peevish Advice</em> column for 
<a href=http://www.brtraditions.com>Blue Ridge Traditions</a> on-line magazine.  Check 
it out!
</ul>
<hr>
<a name="gay"><h3>Gay Stuff</h3>
If you're a ten-percenter, or 'just curious', check out the 
<a href="http://www.qrd.org/QRD/www/index.html">Queer Resources Directory</a>.  
I'm a <a href="http://www.skepsis.com/.glbo/bears/index.html">bear</a>-lover myself, although 
I've found bears don't measure up to Wumpuses.  You can find your own with 
<a  href="http://www.cnct.com/~markk/br/">Bear Roulette</a>, though!
<hr>

<a name="gods"><h3>Gods and Goddesses</h3>
<b>Singer Gods</b> - Considering I'm a classically-trained singer and this man sings like 
a vegetable grater in pain, it's amazing that I love <a href=http://www.science.wayne.edu/~rolewis/michaeltest.htm>Michael McDonald</a>.  
And yet, strangely, I do.  Probably because he's such a hunka hunka burnin' love (and his music's cool, too!)<p>

<b>Singer Goddesses</b> - My Goddess of Love, the fabulous <A
HREF="http://www.automatrix.com/~lavin/">Christine Lavin</a> will bring 
great happiness to your life.  
And so will the up-and-coming folkie who I actually <b><i>know!</i></b>, 
<a href=http://www.songs.com/susan/susan-home.html>Susan Werner</a>.
<p>
<b>Actress Goddesses</b> - Gosh, how the mighty have fallen.  The Susan 
Sarandon Shrine and the 
Emma Thompson Worship Page seem to have gone the way of all things.  
When I first created this section, Winona Ryder had 9 pages - now, none 
of them are left and I don't feel like looking for more.  The 
<a href="http://www.tcp.com/~mary/foster.html">Jodie Foster Gallery</a> 
is still up and active, and so is the 
<a href="http://www.webcom.com/~alsplace/christina_ricci/layout.html">
I love Christina 
Ricci Too!</a> page...  
<p>
Still no one has put up a Carol Burnett page.  Are there no obsessive queens who care any more?
<hr>
<a name="gossip"><h3>Gossip</h3>
One of the most edifying collection of minds on the planet can be found discoursing in 
the newsgroup 
<a href=news:alt.showbiz.gossip>alt.showbiz.gossip</a>.  But for goshsake, read the 
<a href=http://www.rt66.com/~nlopez/afaq.htm>Anti-FAQ</a> and lurk a while 
before you post, lest you 
(a) get flamed as YABWFTNOTN, (b) spell out the word <em>l______</em>, or (c) invoke the ASG curse.
<hr>
<a name="humor"><h3>Humor</h3>
I used to spend my working days in a corporate environment much like <a
href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert">Dilbert</a> has to
deal with.  Now I work for a <a href=http://www.executech.com>company 
he would adore.</a><p>
But those who know me know I play and collect musical instruments, so 
this page of 
<A href="http://www.mit.edu/people/jcb/jokes/">instrument jokes</A> 
holds a place near and dear to my heart.  Especially the soprano jokes.<p>
<hr>


<a name="Web"><h3>Web Sites</h3>

<a href=http://mirsky.com/wow/>Worst of the Web</a> page.
