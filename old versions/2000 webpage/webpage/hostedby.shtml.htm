<p><font color="#006BA5" size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica">Earn
substantial discounts off your WebCom monthly bill simply by
adding this button to your pages!</font></p>

<p align="center"><a href="../referral/host.shtml"><font
color="#006BA5" size="4" face="Arial,Helvetica"><img
src="../images/hostedby.gif" border="0" width="88" height="31"></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Let
the world know that your site is professionally hosted by a
world-class hosting service--and save!</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Because your site is hosted by WebCom--the
world-class hosting service--you know your site will always be
available to the largest number of visitors at the highest
possible speeds and the most affordable prices. Now you can let
visitors to your site know that you use only the best hosting
service for your site, and enjoy substantial savings off your
monthly bill, simply by adding the above button to any or all of
your web pages! </font></p>

<p>A popular WebCom Web site with page sizes of less than around
20k can even earn you money. In the very first month of this
program, we have already credited over $2,000 to our customers,
and mailed several checkes to customers! </p>

<p>We are proud to partner with our customers in our online
marketing! </p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>It's
Easy! </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The program could not be simpler - place the
button on your pages, link it to our referral page, then sit back
and watch the credits pile up. <strong>The more pages you put the
button on, and the busier your site, the greater your discount.</strong>
Each time one of your pages containing our button is displayed,
you earn credit off your monthly fees. And each time somebody
clicks on the button, you get an even bigger credit (in fact, 50
times the amount of the credit for displaying the button)!</font></p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>How
the program works</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>For every 10 times a page at your site displaying our
        button is displayed to a new visitor, your bill is
        credited $.02 (two cents). If you display the button on
        more than one page, each time each visitor visits another
        page with the button, you earn the same credit (repeat
        visits to the same page by the same visitor within one
        hour do not generate repeat credits). </li>
    <li>Each time somebody clicks on the button on any page in
        your site, you earn $.10 (ten cents) (repeated clicks by
        the same person on any of your pages during the same
        24-hour period, do not generate repeat credits). </li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the WebCom service plan you use, if the average
page size at your site, including all graphics and multimedia, is
around 20k (20 kilobytes) or less, you can display 200,000 pages
within your basic monthly allowance (with the WebCom BusinessSite
which includes 4,000 megabytes of free traffic, or 75,000 20k
pages with the WebCom BudgetSite service plan which includeds
1,500 megabytes of free traffic per month). For the very few
high-volume sites that exceed their basic allowance, additional
traffic is billed at $.08/MB, or 8 cents for every aproximately
50 20k page views. However, if you place the Hosted By WebCom
button on all of your pages, we credit you 2 cents for every 10
page views, or 10 cents for every 50 page views. Yes, you read
that right, we charge you 8 cents for every 50 page views, and
pay you 10 cents for every 50 page views (assuming a 20k page
size). </p>

<p>This means that if your web page sizes are around 20k or less,
and all pages display the Hosted by WebCom button, no matter how
busy your site gets, even if you're in the top 3% of busiest
sites at WebCom that actually exceed their traffic allowance (97%
of our customer sites, on average, use less than 10% of the free
traffic included in their service plan), you would never pay any
traffic fees, and could even get completely free service, or if
your account gets a credit balance, even cause us to mail you
money! We have already mailed checks to several WebCom customers!
</p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>&quot;How
much will </strong><em><strong>my</strong></em><strong> discount
be?&quot;</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">2 cents per 10 impressions may not sound like
much, until you keep in mind that your site is earning this
discount 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and over the month it
does add up. As traffic to your site increases, so do your
discounts. Under this program, we anticipate that some of the
busier sites at WebCom will pay absolutely nothing for their
WebCom site, saving hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars,
while less busy and/or more graphics intensive sites will enjoy
substantial discounts. How much will your discount be? There's
one simple way to find out - drop the button on your pages, then
select 'Charges and Credits' from the WebCom main menu, select
your current billing period, and watch as the credits pile up and
your charges go down!</font></p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Installing
the button</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">To participate in this program, simply add the
button to your page(s), linked to our referral page--that's all
there is to it! The URL of the button is: </font><a
href="http://www.webcom.com/images/hostedby.gif"><font size="3">http://www.webcom.com/images/hostedby.gif?page=1</font></a><font
size="3"> (increment the page number for each page you place the
button on to prevent cached reads--see below), and the button
should be a clickable link to </font><a
href="http://www.webcom.com/referral/host.shtml"><font size="3">http://www.webcom.com/referral/host.shtml</font></a><font
size="3">. If you're not using an authoring tool, and/or would
prefer the actual HTML source code for including the button on
your page, here it is:</font></p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Courier">&lt;A
HREF=&quot;http://www.webcom.com/referral/host.shtml&quot; TARGET=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;IMG
SRC=&quot;http://www.webcom.com/images/hostedby.gif?page=1&quot;
<br>ALT=&quot;Hosted by WebCom&quot;  HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</font></p>

<p><font color="#006BA5" size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Special
Notes</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Each page you display should have a unique page number
        assigned to it in the URL (?page=n). The ?page=n suffiix
        doesn't actually do anything, except make the URL unique
        for each of your pages, even though the same image is
        being displayed. The reason for this is to fool browsers
        such as Netscape Navigator into thinking each button on
        each page is a separate image, forcing it to retrieve it
        from the server, not from it's local cache. If you don't
        include the ?page=n suffiix, with a unique page number
        for each page displaying the button, you'll only get
        credit for each vistor for the first time the button is
        displayed. Thereafter, your browser would display the
        local copy from its cache, and not re-retrieve the button
        from the server, and therefore youlose credits. It is not
        necessary to understand all of this, just make sure you
        change the page number on every page displaying the
        button to ensure you get full credit.</li>
    <li>It is important that you display <em>our </em>button at
        http://www.webcom.com/images/hostedby.gif, <em>not a copy
        of it at your site.</em> If you make a copy of the button
        at your site:<ul>
            <li>You would incur additional traffic fees for
                displaying the button from your site (displaying
                the button from our site will not cause any
                additional traffic for your site)</li>
            <li>You would <em>not </em>receive the credit for
                displays, since our system would not recognize
                the copy as the button (however you would still
                get credit for any click-throughs to our site).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We reserve the right to decline this offer to any site.
        Specifically, this offer is not available to
        &quot;adult&quot; sites.</li>
    <li>Repeated page views of the same page by the same visitor
        to your site do not generate repeat discounts. Only after
        1 hour can the same visitor (IP address) view the same
        page and generate another credit for you. However, the
        same visitor can generate many credits for you for
        viewing the button on different pages at your site within
        a short period of time. For example, if a visitor to your
        site viewed 10 different pages at your site, all
        containing the button, and they viewed each page several
        times, you would be credited for 10
        &quot;impressions&quot; or page-views; although their
        total number of page views might be 30 or 40, since they
        only viewed 10 different pages, you recieve 10 page-view
        credits.. A different visitor visiting the same pages at
        the same time would also generate 10 impression
        discounts.</li>
    <li>Each visitor to your site (IP address) can only generate
        one click credit per day, even if they click on the
        button several times on the same or different pages.</li>
    <li>There is a one-hour delay between the time a credit is
        earned and the time it appears as a credit in your
        charges.</li>
    <li>The size of the button is approximately 3k. Currently
        there is not a non-animated version of the button. You
        can create a textual 'Hosted by WebCom' link to our
        referral page, and receive click-thru credits, but you
        would not receive discounts on page views.</li>
