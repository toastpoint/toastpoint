<p>
I was born in Washington D.C. in 1964 and grew up in McLean, Virginia (a 
suburb of Washington, DC) with my parents and older sister.  
That's me and Sam to the left, Mom and Dad to the right.   
Mom and Dad now are happily retired in Beaufort, South Carolina and, in fact, Dad designed the 
library logo on his t-shirt there.  
Sam lives in Austin and works for the <a href=http://www.lgrl.org>
Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas</a>.  (Yep, we're both gay and we're the 
only two children.  How <em>queer</em>!  But Mom and Dad are totally cool with it.)
<p>
I went to 
<a href=http://www.wm.edu/>college in Williamsburg, </a> where I got a B.A. in 
Music.  I went to  
<a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu">graduate school in Baltimore</a>, where 
I majored in horn performance and managed to get an M.M. despite 
totally giving up on the idea of going pro as a hornist.<p>

I spent the rest of my twenties in Philadelphia, where I worked as a 
computer geek, did a lot of community theater, played horn, sang semi-professional 
opera chorus, conducted Philly's gay band and otherwise Learned about Life.
<p>
In 1991, I adopted a huge black fluffy thing named Leopold.

<p>
In 1994, literally on my 30th birthday, I moved to Manhattan and instantly my life became 
much more stimulating.  Although many people warned me about the perils of 
New York City, it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be.
<p>
In early 1995, after ten years of unsuccessful relationships, I met the 
most wonderful man in the world.  Luckily for us, he had been in the process 
of co-op hunting anyway when we met, so by the time we were ready to move in 
together, he had a new home big enough for the both of us.  So now I live 
in historic Jackson Heights, Queens with 
my <a href=wumpus.html>Wumpus</a>!  
We are approaching five years of coupled bliss.  A proposal was made and 
accepted years ago, but the wedding is still in the works.
<p>
Professionally I am a technical writer for what was a small 
software company</a>, which got acquired by a <a href=http://www.merrillcorp.com>much bigger company</a>.  
<p>
In 1998, after performing on and off with the <a href=http://www.bigapplecorps.org>
Lesbian and Gay Big Apple Corps</a> band, the sister band to the one I conducted 
in Philadelphia, I became their artistic director.  Now the BAC takes up 
<b>all</b> my time outside of work, but it's worth it.  The group is 
capable of great things, and 1999 saw our performance of <i>Pictures at an 
Exhibition</i>, as well as my band arrangement of Prokofiev's <i>Piano Concerto 
#1</i>.

<h3>Interests</h3>
Scattered thru the Toast Point page you will find many examples of 
what I'm interested in, but basically they are:
<dL>
<dt><h4>Music</h4>
<dd>Particularly performance - <a href=http://www.io.com/~rboerger/Hornfaq.html>French horn</a> is my major instrument, with 
voice and conducting not far behind.  I also play all brass instruments 
(except for trombone - can't get that slide thing to save my life), piano, bassoon, string bass, recorder and (at one 
point, but not now) clarinet and guitar - none of these necessarily very well.  I 
have a special fondness for chamber music and twentieth-century stuff.  
I listen to classical, folk, Broadway, 70's rock and some pop.<p>
<dt><h4>Theater</h4>
<dd>Haven't done much lately, but I love to act, and have also done off-stage 
stuff such as musical direction, stage management, sound and so on.  
Favorite roles include Bartolo in <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>, Bob in 
<em>Beyond Therapy</em> and Carl-Magnus in <em>A Little Night Music</em>. 
Lately I've been more and more active in the local Gilbert and Sullivan 
scene, singing Pish-Tush and Giuseppe in concert and participating in 
sing-along parties.  
Wumpus and I go to <a href=http://www.playbill.com/playbill/>Broadway shows</a> fairly frequently.
<dt><h4>Literature</h4>
<dd>I read a lot, particularly trashy stuff like murder mysteries.  Inhaled 
much science fiction during my formative years.  I also 
<a href=ponder.html>write</a> occasionally.
