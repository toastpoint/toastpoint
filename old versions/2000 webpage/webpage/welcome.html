Although not as fabulous as  <a href=http://www.justjack.com>justjack.com</a>, and not as  well-dressed as the  <a href= http://www.adcritic.com/content/fedex-combat-rangers.html>Fedex Combat Rangers</a>,  we celebrate all that is scintillating and tweaks one in interesting places! Before we get to the normal stuff, let's get caught up. <hr> <h3> Hee Hee, What's with the Toaster?</h3> My friend Marie likes to do sick and twisted things with the pictures I post on my website. This is the Toast Point family: Wumpus is the daddy, I'm the mommy, and she threw in a couple of kids, which thank goodness we don't have in real life. <h3> How's the <a href="http://www.lgbac.org">Big Apple Corps</a>?</h3> Excellent. Our 20th Anniversary concert was a big success, both musically and audience-wise. We gave a chamber-music concert on Feb. 13th and our spring concert, "Water Music", is on April 8th. <h3> What Else is Going On?</h3> I had a <a href="http://erique.home.netcom.com/bday99/bday99.html">birthday</a>, where I got a really cool digital camera. You can also see my pictures from marching in the <a href="http://erique.home.netcom.com/Halloween/halloween.html">Village Halloween Parade</a>. Stupidly, I forgot to have someone take a picture of me, but I was wearing a Brunnhilde hat with horns and braids. 
<a href=http://erique.home.netcom.com/thanksgiving99/thanks99.html>Thanksgiving</a> pictures are up!</a>  
I also have Xmas pictures to post... but they're not up yet. <h3> And what about the famous Wumpus/Toast Point Wedding?</h3> It's on perpetual hold. It always seems to be "next spring". Perhaps we don't want to stop living in sin! <p>And now to the games.&nbsp; <hr> <center><a href="#who">Who am I?</a> * <a href="#toast">Why Toast Point?</a> <p>&nbsp;<a href="#news">News</a> * <a href="#contests">Contests</a> * <a href="#links">Links</a> * <a href="#other">Assorted</a></center>  <hr> <h2> <a NAME="who"></a>Who is Eric Peterson?</h2> Read my <a href="bio.html">bio page</a> to find out all sorts of stuff! <hr> <h2> Why&nbsp;<a NAME="toast"></a>Toast Point?</h2> <b><i>Toast Point</i></b> is a term of endearment from my <a href="wumpus.html">Wumpus</a>! Once upon a time, when the Wumpus and I were dating, we were getting all googly and disgustingly adorable and calling each other cute things. After I called him "my little nacho chip", he responded with "my little toast point". I thought that was the cutest thing ever, and so unique! So there you are. Toast Point is a moniker that works much better in print than verbally, though. (Now we call each other "sweetness" and "honeyman", if you're curious). <hr> <center>

<b>April - </b>Concert is over, it was FABulous.  <a href=http://erique.home.netcom.com/thanksgiving99/thanks99.html>Thanksgiving</a> pictures are up!</a>  And I'm going to be conducting <i>Patience</i> in Toronto at the T2K Gilbert & Sullivan 
singout!<p>
<b>March - </b>The chamber music concert was excellent and well-attended.   Wumpus and I are both going through huge transitions with our jobs, so we're  both a mess.  We're also in full-scale war with our recalcitrant cat, who  hits the box only when he feels like it (seldom).  Like you needed to know that. <p> <b>January - </b>Wumpus and I had the most incredible relaxed time over the holidays. A vegetative Christmas with my parents in Beaufort, then the five day cruise, which was terrific. Pictures will be posted eventually. Now we're back to the old grind, but we have a busy month ahead of us, with tickets to the Radio City Christmas Special, Putting It Together and Beauty and the Beast. Plus our fifth anniversary January 15th! <p><b>December -</b> <br>Now that the concert is over (hurrah!), Wumpus and I are traveling to Beaufort SC to spend Christmas with my parents. Then we're taking a lovely Carnival cruise to Cancun and Key West, which will put us at sea when the nineties end and the "naughties" begin. <p><b>July</b> - <br>Since I've acquired a gorgeous new <a href="gifs/babygr.jpg">baby grand</a>, I'm selling my beloved <a href="gifs/spinet.jpg">spinet</a>. If you know anyone in the New York metropolitan area who would like a perfectly nice upright piano (which has been continuously praised as a quality instrument by all the tuners who've worked on it), please send 'em my way. <p> <hr> <center> <h2> <a NAME="contests"></a>Contests</h2></center> Once upon a time, I ran three contests on the web.
