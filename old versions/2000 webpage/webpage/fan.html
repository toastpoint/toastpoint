<P>When I was sixteen, and even less informed of a snob than now, my father
bemoaned the number of board games I had managed to collect over the years.
I'd stacked several dozen precariously atop my bedroom bookcase, stuffed
more in a cabinet in the living room, and kept a huge cache of older games
in the basement. I love board games, and at that time I'd go out of my way
to collect any odd or unusual games I ran across; if I found a <I>Clue</I>
knock-off from the forties at someone's garage sale, I was in heaven.</P>

<P>I think it was the morning the overfilled living room cabinet popped
like a deranged jack in-the-box, showering the carpet with a blizzard of
game tokens and paper money and assorted chips and instruction booklets
and minuscule murder weapons, that my poor father snapped. I was on hands
and knees trying to stuff the drills back into <I>King Oil</I> and to keep
the cats from running off with the ping-pong balls from <I>The Guinness
Game of World Records</I> when he walked into the room, shook his head,
and announced, &quot;You spend too much of your money on games.&quot;</P>

<P>I opened my eyes wide as I replied, &quot;But these multi-player challenges
promote interactive sportsmanship and camaraderie, and they sharpen the
wits! Why, my mathematical skills have been enhanced immeasurably by <I>Monopoly</I>
alone!&quot; I had, at that tender age, acquired a charming, yet oily, manner
I would use later that year to great effect; with it I actually managed
to convince my high school teachers that I really didn't need to <I>attend</I>
class to get the work done, and wouldn't it just be less of a teacher-student
workload burden for them if they just let me go home for the day, <I>every</I>
day, at ten in the morning, for the last four months of the school year?</P>

<P>However, my father was (and still is) immune to my weaselly rhetoric.
In a last attempt to further my argument I added derisively, thinking of
Nadine, my best friend who had recently used the last of her allowance to
round out her complete collection of the albums of Parliament and Funkadelic,
&quot;It could be worse. I could be spending my money on <I>rock records</I>.&quot;</P>

<P>Well, here I am, nearly twice as old as <I>that</I> smug little smartass,
and doomed by my hubris. For not only am I still collecting games of all
sorts, from video to computer to board games, but now CD store owners drool
with anticipation when they see me pull up in the parking lot. &quot;Pull
the sale signs!&quot; they'll cry, frantically scurrying around the store
to hide the deep discounts. &quot;This sucker buys at full price!&quot;</P>

<P>And I would <I>kill</I> for Nadine's Parliament/Funkadelic collection.</P>

<P>My fate as a music fan has not been easy. Oh, it started casually enough,
back in the early eighties. A Human League album here. A B-52s album there.
Then I found myself adding my opinions to discussions of the Very Very Important
Issue Of 1984, namely, 'Who's better, Cyndi Lauper or Madonna?' We even
had MTV, back in those early days, playing artists like Martha and the Muffins
and Nona Hendryx. And so I began to collect.</P>

<P>It wasn't long before I realized that I could never be the sort of casual
collector who'd buy a greatest hits package and call it done. Nope. I found
myself prowling the used record stores, scouring the sour-smelling bins
looking for twelve-inch singles or rarities by my favorite artists- and
usually leaving defeated. But the glorious hot rush of excitement when I'd
run across a much desired old vinyl album was enough to keep me addicted
to the search.</P>

<P>Of course, the worst part of this self-set curse is that the music I
accumulated wasn't from your standard run of the mill Michael Jacksons and
Madonna. Oh no. I was invariably thrilled by the truly obscure. If an American
band had virtually no following in its own country but was popular in Germany
and Luxembourg, chances are that I'd be begging record store owners for
a bumpersticker, a pin, anything. If a band had lost its U.S. fans but still
released albums in Japan, I'd be damning the injustice of it all while ordering
forty dollar import CDs.</P>

<P>However, I never wanted to tend to the adolescent extreme of deifying
my favorite artists. My younger sister served as my object lesson for that
particular pitfall. During her teen years she developed something of an
insane affection for the British group Wham! Now, I'm really not sure what
it was about Wham! that made her such a rabid fan. Yes, George Michael did
look awfully cute in his tennis shoes in that video, and the group's bubble-gum
music was kind of catchy. But save for a certain perverse kitschy quality,
the band never really did that much for me. And gracious, they certainly
didn't have the deep, meaningful lyrics of groups like Kajagoogoo or Vanity
6, did they now?</P>

<P>Alicia bought all the magazines with the Wham! boys on them. She bought
posters. She bought albums and singles. Walking into her room felt a bit
like trespassing in the Sacred Temple of Wham! during the High Wham! Rites.
George Michael and Andrew Ridgely leered from every patch of available wall
or ceiling space. Votive candles glowed before an airbrushed photo of the
singers. Soft Wham! music oozed from her cassette player. The only thing
missing were legions of Wham! penitents busily engaged in self-flagellation
with Wham! whips made from recycled pages of <I>Tiger Beat </I>and <I>Creem</I>.</P>

<P>Now, Alicia would become very defensive towards Wham!, or as she called
them, her 'Wham!-babies,' when one of us--that is, the unwashed and unfaithful--dared
to denigrate their universally acclaimed talents. &quot;Alicia,&quot; I'd
say knowingly. &quot;Their songs are all about <I>sex</I>, you know.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They are <I>not</I>!&quot; she'd cry indignantly.</P>

<P>&quot;What do you think he's talking about when he says to wake him up
before she go-gos and that he doesn't want to be goin' solo? He's really
talking about how he wants to . . . <I>you know</I> . . . so he won't have
to mastu--&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;LA LA LA LA LA!&quot; By this time, Alicia would stick her fingers
in her ears and start droning loudly in order that the demonic words of
this Wham! agnostic might not tempt her from the true straight and narrow
path of Wham!dom. &quot;I can't HEAR you and besides that's NOT what my
Wham!-babies are talking about! He means he wants a kiss before I leave--I
mean before whoever his girlfriend is, leaves. LA LA LA LA LA.&quot;</P>

<P>Wicked, evil brother that I am, I would say, &quot;Alicia's in <I>luh-uhve</I>.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;LA LA LA LA LA!&quot;</P>

<P>Then, pulling my trump card, I'd recite the passage I read in her diary
that she'd shared with me at the tender age of six, when she had a crush
on Randolph Mantooth from <I>Emergency</I>: &quot;I went to California,
and I jumped into his arms . . . !&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shut up!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;. . . He kissed me, and said, 'I love you!'&quot;</P>

<P>At this point, Alicia would run from the room and retreat into the Temple
of Wham, to console herself by singing along with 'Wham! Rap.' She really
never should have told me of the Randolph Mantooth crush, you know.</P>

<P>When Alicia started making noises about choosing a college, my parents
were slightly worried she'd want to stay at home and attend a local university
&quot;If she doesn't go,&quot; my mother growled, &quot;I'm going to be
forced to assassinate George Michael.&quot; By this point, my mother knew
the words to all the first three Wham! albums, and would occasionally find
herself waking up in the mornings, involuntarily singing lyrics such as,
&quot;Wham! Bam! I am! A man . . !&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't do that!&quot; I exclaimed in horror. &quot;Remember what
happened with Jon-Eric Hexum! And she didn't have <I>half</I> as bad a crush
on him!&quot; Alicia had worn black for a straight month after that particular
teen idol's death.</P>

<P>&quot;Either those Wham!-babies go,&quot; she muttered prophetically,
&quot;or I do.&quot;</P>

<P>However, my mother was surprisingly perky and supportive--suspiciously
so, in fact--later that summer when it came to helping Alicia pack for her
new school in Georgia. &quot;You should take <I>all</I> Your Wham! posters
and pictures,&quot; she advised. &quot;They'll make you feel at home! All
of them. Every single one. Don't leave any behind. Not even a tape insert.&quot;</P>

<P>But when it came to removing the Wham! artifacts, her last week at home,
Alicia refused any help. Suddenly acquiring the ultra-sensitive ears of
the Bionic Woman, Alicia could hear my mother creep into her small bedroom
all the way from the other end of the house; if my mother so much as <I>thought
</I>about removing the posters from the wall, there would come a mighty
screech of &quot;Don't <I>touch</I> my Wham!-babies!&quot; Then our own
household Jamie Somers-cum-Incredible Hulk would launch herself from the
sofa, up the stairs, and over the bed, landing in a protective position
before the wall in her bedroom--all in one flat second, growling obscenities
that would make a longshoreman blush.</P>

<P>Moving day finally came. The Wham! posters had been rolled one inside
the other until they formed a thick tube. The pictures and tapes had been
packed into a special box. &quot;Let's not forget your Wham! stuff,&quot;
said my mother, that morning, with an gloating expression that could only
imply pity for my sister's poor new roommate. &quot;You'd better put it
in the car.&quot;</P>

<P>Alicia sniffed doubtfully. &quot;Puh-leeze. How could I forget my Wham!-babies?&quot;</P>

<P>A little later, my father noticed the Wham! paraphernalia sitting on
the bed. &quot;Don't forget the Wham! things,&quot; he said pointedly, but
managing not to sound as if he was begging.</P>

<P>My sister merely gave him a scornful look.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey,&quot; I said later. &quot;Want me to carry the Wham! posters
out to the car for you?&quot; I was not in an altruistic mood, you understand.
Merely anxious to see them gone for four years.</P>

<P>&quot;<I>I</I> will be carrying my Wham!-babies <I>myself</I>,&quot;
Alicia snarled. &quot;They will ride on my lap <I>all</I> the way, and they
will be the <I>first</I> thing I unpack when I get to Georgia. So I wish
that everyone would <I>stop asking.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>Of course, moving across a few states, even if just for college, is always
hectic. My parents were busy packing for themselves, that day, and I was
kept busy dragging suitcases to the curb. Finally, though, the car was loaded
up. I stood sleepily on the sidewalk, barefoot, assuring my mother that
yes, I'd be fine on my own for a few days, and yes, I'd remember to feed
the cats, and of course I'd not let them get outside and eat the nest of
cardinals in the apple tree, and yes, I would eat right, and <I>mother</I>,
I <I>am </I>twenty-one and can take care of <I>myself,</I> you know. Alicia
stalked out of the house with the haughty, dignified mien of Marie Antoinette
being led to the guillotine, sat in the back seat among the boxes and boxes
of clothes and books, and allowed my parents to chauffeur her off. I waved
as they disappeared down the street.</P>

<P>Back in the house, I did a little jig. No more Wham! No more Wham! No
more waking me up before you go-gos, no more last Christmas I gave you my
hearts, no more I don't want your freedoms. There would be no more Wham!,
and no more Wham! shrine, because Alicia's room was clean, clean, clean
of everything associated with. . . .</P>

<P>I opened Alicia's door. On the bed were a neatly rubber-banded tube of
posters and a large box scrawled with the words <I>Fragile!! Wham!-babies</I>
in green felt tip pen, still sitting where my sister had forgotten them,
right before she left.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>Now, when it comes to my own obsessions, I admit to a recent--and still
painful, thank you--brush with disillusion. I first ran across a mention
of the band Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes in <I>Vanity Fair</I> magazine.
I should have suspected that I was doomed the moment I saw the two-page
spread of dashing, zoot-suited Mr. Bean and his four ravishing blonde backup
singers. If I'd been paying attention, the clues were all there. The caption
mentioned that the group commanded a small but fanatically loyal following
in New York. It plainly stated that they were underappreciated in the land
of the free and the home of the brave, but that they rivalled Jerry Lewis'
popularity in France. In fact, as a public service the article should have
plainly printed, preferably in bold letters, &quot;Mr. Vance Briceland,
do not start collecting this band's recordings, because you will spend more
time, effort, and money tracking down Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes albums
and related works than any other band in the history of your life.&quot;
But I wouldn't have read it, because I was already zooming out the door
to the nearest Sam Goody's to see what they had in stock.</P>

<P>My collection of Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes albums grew sluggishly.
I instantly liked the music--a melange of styles, from funk to salsa to
big-band. The lyrics were clever. I was hooked. Over the course of two years,
I researched, I read reviews of the band in back issues of magazines in
the library and on microfilm, and gradually amassed my Chili Bean archives.
My friend Margaret, in the District of Columbia, found the group's out-of-print
second album for me; my friend Carol, in Houston, sent me an interview with
the group from a Sunday color supplement. I finally collected the seven
albums the group had released by that point, all the twelve-inch singles,
the two Kitchenettes solo albums, and the record by a famous British band
on which the Kitchenettes sang backup.</P>

<P>But that was kid stuff. I also had all the recordings from the band Chili
Bean had been involved with earlier: Mr. Goodbar's Independent Swingin'
Orchestra. I'd tracked down not one, but two copies of the rare disco release
that Mr. Goodbar's Independent Swingin' Orchestra's female lead singer had
made as a failed solo effort. I had the albums Chili Bean produced for other
artists between the two bands. I could recite all their lyrics, and could
name the musicians playing on any individual song.</P>

<P>And by this point, I was attending their concerts when I could. One of
my greatest, most thrilling close encounters with the band happened at a
District of Columbia concert, when I'd mistaken the amount of travel time
I needed and arrived at the theatre a full two hours early. In the men's
room, I was unzipping at the row of urinals when the band's bass player,
a colorfully dressed fellow with the stage name of Conga Clyde, walked in.
(It was difficult not to recognize the banana-yellow zoot suit.) He stood
a urinal over from me, doing his business, while I tried not to act like
a rube. So after summoning a certain amount of sang-froid, I finally initiated
this scintillating and clever banter:</P>

<P>ME: Hey, you're Conga Clyde, aren't you?</P>

<P>HIM: I sure am.</P>

<P>ME: I really, really, really, really, really, really, really like your
bass playing.</P>

<P>HIM: Um, thanks.</P>

<P>ME: No, I really, really do.</P>

<P>HIM: Okay. Thanks man. <I>(shake shake shake)</I></P>

<P>ME: Sure! <I>(shake shake shake)</I></P>

<P>HIM: <I>(flush)</I></P>

<P>ME: <I>(flush)</I></P>

<P>Given a few days and a very active imagination, I'd managed to transform
the details of this encounter into something with the mythic resonance of
the TV ad in which the winsome urchin reaches up to offer Mean Joe Greene
a Coke.</P>

<P>But oh, those Kitchenettes. I was in love with the Kitchenettes. They
exuded chorine glamour. I could sing their glorious first solo album, <I>Someone's
in the Diner with the Kitchenettes</I>, from start to finish, without accompaniment.
It's true that in concert, they were relegated to bumping and grinding on
precariously platforms while Chili Bean jammed with the band, occasionally
providing off-key backup vocals in sing-song voices. And yes, I suspected
that they'd been chosen less for their singing voices than for their ample
cleavage. But oh, those Kitchenettes!</P>

<P>There was Cherry Popp, the gorgeous one who sang a little bit more tunefully
than the others, and Audrey Gore, the band's choreographer and costume designer,
and Babs Bailey, who would open her angelic mouth to reveal a Noo Yawk bray
of astonishing proportions, and Angelique Svenska, who was Swedish. They
wore bathing suits with high heels, or rags with high heeled sandals, or
little togas with high-heeled silver slip-ons. They glittered with sequins,
or gyrated while twirling giant cocktail umbrellas. Hell, they could have
sat on stage singing their tone-deaf 'whoa-oh-oh-ohs' while digging out
their ingrown toenails, and I would've been entranced.</P>

<P>It wasn't bad enough that the band's albums were occupying most of my
shelf space and practically all the airtime on my turntable; Chili Bean
and the Kitchenettes had weaselly little ways of infiltrating the rest of
my life as well. In my last year of graduate school, I travelled to New
York state to give a paper at an academic professional conference with the
(I thought) clever title of &quot;Destructive Hegemony: Economic Realism
and Social Change in Popular Music 1979 1988.&quot; It was largely an overview
of popular songs about money during that decade, with a heavy emphasis on
the Kitchenette's solo song, &quot;Who Raised the Price of My Mascara? (I've
Gotta Date Tonite!)&quot;</P>

<P>Now, my sad little tale begins a year ago. Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes,
though still producing albums for Japan and the Cayman Islands, hadn't released
a domestic album in years. Even the original Kitchenettes had all fled this
sinking ship, and the stand-ins were a tarty, tatty crew with even fewer
vocal skills than the glorious originals (and let me tell you, that's something
of an achievement). I'd just brought my archives to a close with the discovery
of a Chili Bean produced 1979 album, <I>Itchy Switcheroo</I>, that I'd been
seeking for eleven years.</P>

<P>So here I was, thinking I could finally lay this particular obsession
to rest, when I was browsing the world wide web, and ran across the name
of Audrey Gore. &quot;Surely,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;This can't
be the same Audrey Gore who was a Kitchenette in Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes!&quot;
I followed the link, and sure enough, it was the home page of ex-Kitchenette
Audrey, plugging both her upcoming solo album and her own line of hideous
handmade furniture she'd created with 'modern design values' (that is, each
piece was in the general shape and color of an oversized spleen, only dripping
with fringe). The furniture was, as I mentioned, god-awful crap, but Audrey
still looked like hot stuff.</P>

<P>There was an email address at the bottom of the page. I hesitated for
a second. I'd never written to a celebrity before. The only person I'd known
who done anything like that was my mother, who sent a letter to the author
of <I>My Friend Flicka</I> as a girl (and, incidentally, got quite a nice
reply). Fan letters were so . . . so . . . middle-brow. I could never, ever,
in a thousand years, write such a thing, especially to such a clever, talented
chanteuse as Audrey Gore. . . .</P>

<P>Within minutes I'd produced the following minor masterpiece.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DL>
  <DD>Dear Audrey,
  <DL>
    <DD>This is the first time I've indulged in an unabashed fan letter. When
    I was browsing a set of new links on Yahoo!, I was incredibly thrilled
    to discover you were authoring the 'Audrey Squawks!' page.
    <DD>I've been a huge fan of Chili Bean and the Kitchenettes for over a
    decade, and a fan of Mr. Goodbar's Independent Swingin' Orchestra before
    that. I bought and enjoyed every album, attended concerts across the country,
    and introduced many of my friends to the pleasures of the group. I especially
    admired <I>your</I> contributions to the band--the memorable choreography,
    the witty costumes, the incredible designs for the album covers and for
    the stage, and of course, your glamorous appearances as a Kitchenette onstage
    and on vinyl. The Kitchenette solos albums, <I>Someone's in the Diner with
    the Kitchenettes</I> and <I>These Kitchenettes Were Made for Walkin'</I>,
    in particular, were two of my favorite albums of the '80s!
    <DD>More than anything else, I'd like to thank you for your part in the
    musical pleasure I've enjoyed for the last fifteen years. I'm very much
    looking forward to your solo CD. When will it be released?
    <DD>I wish you much luck and much joy in your future endeavors, online
    and on disc. Oh, by the way, I <I>love</I> the furniture!
  </DL>
</DL>

<P><BR>
This last sentence was a blatant lie, of course. Even if she'd sent me one
of those spleen sofas as a gift, I'd sooner burn it to fringed charcoals
than ever give it to Goodwill, much less put it in my living room.</P>

<P>And I also have to touch on my folly, here. Because frankly, the 'memorable
choreography' of the Kitchenettes could be done by anyone owning a hula
hoop. The 'clever costumes' of which I spoke were little more than coconut
shells halves strapped to the girls' chests with leather dog collars. And
the 'incredible album covers' that Audrey designed were usually shots of
artificial palm trees with the scantily-clad Kitchenettes coyly peeking
out from behind the fronds.</P>

<P>I didn't realize it at the time, but I was blinded by my unquestioning
fandom to the Kitchenettes. You think I would have known. The signs were
all there. The sure tipoff was that they couldn't sing, for one thing. Their
hair was probably bleached. Their songwriting skills were minimal. But despite
all the evidence at hand, I'd actually gone trotting off to New York, five
years before, proclaiming that Audrey's lyrics (Sample: &quot;My boyfriend's
gone tho' he said he'd be right back/It's been seven hours, where in heck
is he at/Oh well I guess everything will be all rite/Who raised the price
of my mascara? I've gotta date tonite!&quot;) were 'a faux-naive reaction,
cleverly appropriating and spoofing the vocabulary of lesser and ephemeral
pop, to the hegemonic pressures brought to bear upon the post-feminist era
in an age of retributive conservatism.'</P>

<P>In short, what the hell was I thinking?</P>

<P>For two weeks, though, I walked on air after sending that email. I played
<I>Someone's in the Diner with the Kitchenettes</I> so many times that Craig
finally forbade it while he was in the house. I dusted off the framed <I>Vanity
Fair</I> photo that had sparked my interest in the band so many years before,
and hung it on a wall. I didn't really expect a reply from Audrey; I was
buoyed merely by the experience at having written her. Heck, that was a
<I>lot</I> more exciting than urinating next to Conga Clyde.</P>

<P>But reply, she did, two weeks later.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DL>
  <DD>hello fan
  <DD>i am glade. to see that you ar fane of me. i am still seecing recrud
  deal so dont expec to bye the recrud yet!!! you ar interesting.
  <DD>bye
  <DD>audrey
  <P>&nbsp;
</DL>

<P><BR>
I read through the email four or five times before daring to think about
it clearly. Loyally, I discarded my first startled impression of illiteracy.
That would be ridiculous. After all, in one of the group's videos, Audrey
was shown reading a book by Hannah Arendt!</P>

<P>Instead, I decided to stick with the more easily digested notion that
Audrey was merely a bad typist. But then I noticed the multiple misspellings
of 'recrud' and 'ar,' and the little seeds of doubt began to take root in
my conscious mind.</P>

<P>I was still smitten, though. And she <I>did</I> say I was <I>interesting</I>,
which was a <I>huge </I>compliment from a <I>Kitchenette</I>! So I instantly
composed another letter to Audrey, telling her all about my 'Economic Realism
and Social Change' presentation in New York, and outlining the high points
of my thesis to her, and going into my exegesis of &quot;Who Raised the
Price of My Mascara? (I've Gotta Date Tonite!).&quot; I'm not sure why I
thought she'd be interested; I think I still harbored the fantasy that she'd
write back and say, &quot;How trenchant your insight! Why, that was indeed
my intent, sir, but you have articulated what I could only express through
the instinctive rhythms of a pop style imitative of the Supremes!&quot;
and send me a plane ticket to New York for the weekend, where she'd invite
the other ex-Kitchenettes to join us in a big barbecue.</P>

<P>Then I got another letter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<DL>
  <DD>hello mr fan
  <DD>you now lots of big word! mascara is a cool song. i wrote it when i
  ran out of mascara one day. i was vary sad. ar there lots of big club in
  detoit? can you get me date to play ther?
  <DD>bye
  <DD>audrey
  <DD>ps i can give dicount on sofa if you want. to persent for fans!
</DL>

<P><BR>
At this point a few things began to sink in.</P>

<P>1) The lyrics &quot;said he'd be right back&quot; and &quot;where in
heck is he at&quot; don't rhyme. They really don't. Not even close.</P>

<P>2) Audrey probably thinks they <I>do</I>.</P>

<P>3) 'Mascara' wasn't a clever song written in cheeky response to economic
inflation, after all. It probably wasn't a clever <I>anything</I>. It was
written because Audrey had run out of mascara. And because she was very
sad.</P>

<P>4) 'Mascara' wasn't a faux-naive appropriation of the language of ephemeral
pop songs. It was written by <I>a tone-deaf singer with the vocabulary of
a</I> <I>four year old</I>.</P>

<P>5) Audrey probably couldn't read Hannah Arendt. She probably couldn't
<I>read</I>.</P>

<P>6) Oh god. I'd gotten up in front of an audience of <I>several hundred
people</I> and presented Audrey's lyrics as the smartest, wittiest, most
socially incisive writing since Oscar Wilde, and here I was confronted with
more than ample evidence that Audrey couldn't cut melting Jello with <I>her</I>
dull wits.</P>

<P>7) Oh hell. Oh hell. Oh <I>hell</I>.</P>

<P>Yes, it was my first realization that the celebrities and demi-celebrities
I worshipped could be dumb as sticks. And the sudden wrench in view wasn't
a pretty sight, folks. This wasn't me leaving my Wham!-babies several hundred
miles behind accidentally; this felt more like Wham!-babies assaulting me
in a dark alley, spitting on me, and leaving me for dead after criticizing
my fashion choices.</P>

<P>I walked around in a blind panic for several days, thinking several years
back to that damned conference and trying to remember if anyone in the massive
audience had been sniggering behind their hands while I intoned the lyrics
to 'Mascara.' Had I mortified myself thoroughly? Was I the joke of academe?
It was a couple of weeks until I was able to console myself with the irrefutable
fact that no matter how stupid your own criticism is, people think it's
fabulous as long as you present it in a very serious, dry, academic voice,
and that besides, someone very famous, probably from Harvard, is writing
an even stupider monograph about hidden masturbatory imagery in Victorian
literature. Rest assured.</P>

<P>Audrey continues to write me, more often than I'd like, asking me if
I've found that club in Detroit where she can make a solo debut, or whether
I'd like to buy some of her heavily discounted furniture, but I haven't
written her back. Not even out of pity. I just don't have the heart. The
framed <I>Vanity Fair</I> photo is in the closet again, and although I still
listen to my Chili Bean albums, I'm afraid my Kitchenette encounter has
tarnished my enjoyment of them. I wince whenever I hear &quot;Mascara.&quot;
And though I still shell out big money for an import CD whenever the group
releases a new album in Japan or Morocco, it's mostly a joyless exercise.</P>

<P>So these days, whenever I'm tempted to deify a celebrity, I carefully
remind myself that they could be as stupid as a chunk of granite, and that
I shouldn't idolize them on the basis of their charm alone. Even for practice,
I sometimes squeeze my eyes shut, think hard of an actor or singer I admire,
like Helen Hunt or Kristin Scott Thomas or Dusty Springfield, and while
I still have them captured in my imagination, I make them regard me with
a slack-jawed expression and say, &quot;Hey, mister fan . . . you sure know
big words.&quot;</P>

<P>It'll prevent disappointment for me somewhere down the road. I'm sure
of it.<BR>
