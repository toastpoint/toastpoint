<h3>
Welcome!</h3>
Welcome to the <i>
Toast Point Haiku Contest!</i>
.  No fancy prizes, just publication on the Web and gold stars by the ones the sage thinks are
particularly wonderful.<p>
<h3>
What's a Haiku?</h3>
It's a poem.  According to the 
<A HREF="http://www.oslonett.no/home/keitoy/haiku.html">
HAIKU for PEOPLE!</A> page, the rules are simple:<OL>
<LI>
Each haiku has three lines.<LI>
The first line has five syllables.<LI>
The second line has seven syllables.<LI>
The third line has five syllables again.</OL>
<p>
They can be written on any topic in any language.  You're also supposed to include a "seasonal
word", a word or phrase that implies a season, like "falling leaves".The contest splits up into
categories if categories become apparent.  <p>
<h3>
What are the <a name="hrules">
House Rules</a>
 for Haikus?</h3>
It has been made clear to Toast Point many times that the five/seven/five rule is not appropriate for
English-language haikus, but entries should not stray too far from the path.  Any of the following, in
no particular order, may tickle the Sage enough to give you a gold star:<br>
<ul>
<li>
Attaining the five/seven/five syllable ideal<li>
Seasonal word<li>
Keeping each line self-contained (no sentences spill to the next line)<li>
Striking imagery<li>
Humor or clever wordplay</ul>
None of these are rules per se, but rather suggestions.  Also see <a
href=../limerick/docs/editing.html>
how contest entries are edited</a>

<h3>
Notes for Serious Haiku Divas</h3>
Apparently, what we at the Toast Point Page are doing is closer to <a
href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~troq/Gardens/senryu.html>
Senryu</a>
 than true Haiku, but as John Cho, editor of the <a
href="http://pemtropics.mit.edu/~jcho/editorial/">
Editorial Haiku Home Page</a>
 and the <a href="http://pemtropics.mit.edu/~jcho/spam/">
SPAM Haiku Archive Home Page</a>
 points out, no one knows what that is.  John's page provides a link to Tonio Roque's <a
href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~troq/Gardens/senryu.html>
Senryu</a>
 definition above.<HR>
<h3>
Haiku on the Net!</h3>
Check out the <a href="http://www.viku.com/">
Viku</a>
 page, where haikus are given the full treatment - videos, music, the works!  The <a
href="http://www.crew.umich.edu/~brinck/poetry/manifesto.html">
SciFaiku</a>
 page is interesting as well.  As mentioned above, John Cho's <a
href="http://www.naic.edu/~jcho/editorial/ehp.html">
Editorial Haiku</a>
 and <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~jcho/spam/sha.html">
SPAM Haiku</a>
 pages are wonderful and much worth visiting.  And come visit <a
