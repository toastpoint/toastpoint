my girl goes outside<br>
she says, "come on, join me, its nice"<br>
air makes her sneeze

sweat rolls down her cheek<br>
too hot in this room, this bed<br>
I just move closer

the last thing, her jeans<br>
I hang them out on the line<br>

almost like a dream<br>
a cool night, under the stars<br>
playing in the grass

An ornery cricket chirps louder<br>
The nearer I get!

<I>Toast Point is reminded of a story told to him by a friend, of her child at the same age.  After viewing a large branch (big stick) blown down by the storm, she went running up to the local meter man happily yelling, "Big dick!  Big dick!".</I>

Must we all say good-<br>
Night to the moon's mist within<br>
Your eye this mourning?
<p>
Ashen remembrance<br>
Turns to moist dew; soulless lips<br>
Just in spite of you.

Beneath soughing boughs<br>
Through your leaves pass endless skies<br>
O mighty dwarf tree.
<p>
Eternity here<br>
Amid the fragrant past of<br>
Japanese bamboo.
<p>
Early plum blossoms<br>
Do not smile too much at me <br>
Your brightness is spring.

Rediscovering.

Life without music<br>
Is like life without eating<br>
And living as easy.
