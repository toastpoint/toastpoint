<i>The poet comments, "I saw your haiku on haiku on your best of page and decided to send you this.  Also, a note on the 5-7-5 form. Take a look at The Haiku Handbook, William J. Higginson, Kodansha Intl. Tokyo, 1985  p. 100.  
The Japanese count "onji" which are not exactly the same as a syllable. Higginson argues presuasively that a total of 12 syllables (in English) more accurately translate the Japanese Haiku. I like a 4-5-4 format for writing most of my haiku."</i>
