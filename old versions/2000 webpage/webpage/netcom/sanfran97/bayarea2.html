<h3>Monday (Memorial Day)</h3>
Monday was our day to get together with Marianne, my buddy from Pennsylvania Opera 
Theatre chorus, and her husband, <a href=http://keck.ucsf.edu/~holder>Gaylord</a>, who moved to SF last year from Philly.  Wump 
and I got up and I went downstairs again to search out milk.  This time, they gave me a huge 
styrofoam cupful and charged me for it.  Hmf.  Wump and I drove across the street from the 
hotel to the mini-mall, where they had a Starbucks and several other café/breakfast places and 
a Safeway.  Went to the Safeway to see if they had (a) Parmalat milk boxes, which don't 
require refrigeration (as we had no mini-bar), and (b) a squeegee for the rental car windows, 
since when I got up to move the car Sunday, I had to mop off the windows with my sweatshirt 
sleeve, ug.  The Safeway staff was almost obsessively helpful, and although they didn't stock 
Parmalat, they GAVE us a Safeway squeegee for free (first the tiramisu, then the squeegee.  Is 
California a gravy train or what?).

Drove in while drinking high-octane Starbucks coffee and eating high-priced baked goods, and 
actually got to G&M's house an hour early, so we drove up to Twin Peaks, one of the highest 
spots in SF.  Gorgeous view of the bay, ocean, and GG Bridge, as well as most of the city.  
Windy and bracing, and what a view.  I expounded to the Wump how NYC is a wonderful 
city, but not a <em>beautiful</em> city geographically, which SF really is.  He smiled 
and nodded like a good partner should.
 <p>
Back to M&G's house, where we were warmly welcomed.  They live in the top floor of a 
house, which is reached by many many flights of stairs, which is impressive since Marianne is 
seven months pregnant.  We got the tour of the house, then went off to a new restaurant by the 
Pacific coast called the Beach Chalet or some such.  A microbrewery, and Gaylord got one of 
those beer sampler things.  The food was quite nice and I had, of all things, fried calamari 
tacos.  
<p>
<img src=sutro.jpg align="right" alt="Photo: Wumpus, Marianne and Gaylord at the Sutro Baths">M&G then took us up the street to see the ruins of the Sutro baths, which, it turns out, 
I'm familiar with through posters.  Any time you see a poster of a huge building with huge 
swimming pools and a bunch of people in 1920's bathing suits, that's the Sutro baths.  They're 
all gone now, but the ruins are impressive enough.
<p>
Then off to Golden Gate Park, with the intention of renting a pedaled contrivance for four to 
tootle around in.  This plan was only mildly thwarted when (a) the four-person surrey was 
already rented and (b) as soon as we parked, I locked the keys in the rental car.  Undaunted 
(well, they were - I was quite daunted), we called Avis and set up someone to come out and 
rescue the keys, then rented two two-person surreys (<a href=mg-surrey.jpg>One for them</a> and <a href=wumpus-surrey.jpg>one for us</a>) and tootled around anyway.  Quite fun, 
except those things are horrible to pedal uphill (to be fair, the bike rental guy warned us).  Did 
one round around the central part where the science museum is (where I had been five years 
ago), then back to have me meet the Avis guy, which I did, then another round somewhere 
else.  By this point we needed to get back to M&G's place, as they were throwing their 
weekly Monday night dinner party.  This episode also greeted us with the trip's only bad 
weather - cloudiness and a wee bit of rain.
<p>
Wump gave Gaylord hints on cooking mussels, as Gaylord was whipping up a paella feast, 
then the Wump and I took Ms. M to the fancy grocery store to buy stuff (you can buy wine in 
SF grocery stores, yay!).  Wump bought a pint of milk to solve the morning coffee problem, 
and we indeed spent the rest of the trip keeping pints of milk in the ice bucket.  Back to the 
apt., where Wump and I cleaned greens, Gaylord frantically cooked, and Marianne sat with 
her feet up, the best to nurture the being within her.  A flock of random friends of M&G from 
their workplaces (G is a network admin at a local U, M is a fund-raiser for SF opera) showed 
up and we all had a fine time.  Most amusing part of the evening is when we were sitting down to eat, someone buzzed the front door and we let him in, assuming it was a late dinner guest.  To our surprise and amusement, it was actually a mild-mannered navy-suited Mormon missionary, who timidly peeked in the door after braving the whole staircase, only to be shooed out amid hearty laughter.  Poor thing.
<p>
Wump and I, fading, left around 8:30 (and I had to go to work 
the next day, too, sob).

<h3>Tuesday</h3>
The first day of work, ug, and I had to be there by 8:00 a.m.  Luckily, I'm still somewhat ahead, so getting up at 6:30 wasn't the usual chore.  Wump got up with me so he could drive me to Fireman's Fund and then go cavorting on his own.  We grabbed bagels and coffee from the mini-mall and went north to FF.
<p>
Suffice it to say that for me, it was a grueling work day, but for my honeyman, it was a lovely (if lonely day).  He went to Stinson Beach (which I went to later in the week) and Muir Woods, which were filled with redwoods and quite wonderful, so he says.  
<p>
I was greeted by a smiling Wump and a purple car at 5:00, and we went back to the hotel and took a swim in the pool!  Quite fun, and they also had a hot tub right there which we tried out too.  Showered, and somehow I managed to swallow or inhale some nasty hotel soap, which had me hacking and spitting for the next hour.  Moving on, we went to a wonderful Spanish restaurant a few exits south, recommended by one of my bosses.  It's called Bolero and it's right by a ferry terminal and it's in an old brick factory actually inside the old kiln.  Very atmospheric and the food was fabulous (I can't remember what we had, but it was yummy).
