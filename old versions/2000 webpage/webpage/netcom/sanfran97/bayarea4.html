<h2>Part Four</h2>

<h3>Friday</h3>
Friday was my last day at the client site, and by then most of the bugs had been worked out.  Three of the ladies who I had trained were nice enough to take me out to lunch with them - we had a very nice time at a Chinese restaurant.  The workday ended early, and I called my Wump to come pick me up, but he'd just gotten out of the pool and had to shower, and I knew with all the primping and hair-curling, I wasn't gonna get picked up any earlier.  And I was right.
<p>
Our plot was to drive into the city and have a fabulous dinner and do one last walking-around session.  We unfortunately hit bridge traffic and it took us quite a while to get into the city.  One odd activity, which may be a local custom, was a "dialog" of horn-honking inside the tunnel (through which we moved glacially) that culminated in trade-offs of the "shave and a haircut" rhythm.  Whee.
<p>
<b>Spotted</b> on a car in front of us, once we got into the city: a vanity plate reading "POOFTA".
<p>
This time around, we did manage to find parking on Columbus Street and go walking around.  I had hinted to the Wump that I was pretty hungry by this point (at 6:30), so when we got to The Stinking Rose to see if they had room, I was all set to go in.  We went in and found out they had room and they took reservations, too.  Mr. Wump said, "Well, why don't we get a reservation for 7:30?" 
<p>
A line of people had formed behind us and the host-people were waiting for me to make a reservation, not really allowing a long drawn-out discussion.  I shot Wumpus an imploring look.  "7:30?  But I'm hungry..."
<p>
"What?" he queried, obviously not hearing what I said, or picking up on the imploring look.
<p>
<b>"I'M HUNGRY!"</B>, I repeated, perhaps unnecessarily loudly.  (I had to pee, too, but I wasn't bringing that up.)
<p>
After scraping himself off the wall, a rather frightened and hurt Wumpus, and embarrassed me, followed the waiter to our table.  And after I ran to the men's room, I came back and apologized and told him I hadn't meant to yell, but ...
<p>
Anyway, we had a lovely, garlic-laden dinner.  The restaurant's theme, is of course, garlic, and they have strings of garlic bulbs all over the place and our cute bearlike waiter had a garlic tie on (it wasn't made of garlic, it had a garlic design).  I started with a rock shrimp and prawn salad with a garlic vinaigrette, and he started with the garlic-potato soup.  I didn't like his soup, but he did, and I loved my salad.  He had a big pork chop and garlic mashed potatoes for the entree, and I had, get this, crab ravioli in a garlic tomato basil sauce.  I wasn't really tasting the garlic much, for some reason, but for the entire evening after, I sure did!  Anyway, it was all wonderful, but we passed on the garlic ice cream and biscotti afterward.
<p>
Then we had our walking-around session - the Embarcadero, and a bit of Chinatown, and Union Square, which would be impressive if I didn't have access to NYC's 5th Ave. which has all the same stores, like Saks and Tiffany's.  Then drove back to the hotel fairly early, 'cause we had to get up absurdly early to get the Wump to his plane.
