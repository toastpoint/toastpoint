<P>Welcome to <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/bio.html">Eric Peterson</A>'s <I>Toast Point Page</I>, where we celebrate all that is scintillating and tweaks one in interesting places! 
<H2><A name=news></A>News</H2>

<p>
<strong>September, 2006</strong> - Summer's over.  Mr. Man is now unemployed, though hard at work in various ways.  I'm gearing up for auditions (St. Bart's <i>A Little Night Music</i>) and going through the membership process for the Blue Hill Troupe.  More on that once things fall into place. 
<hr>
<p><strong>August, 2006</strong> - I'm back from the International Gilbert & Sullivan festival!  I had a great time.  Ruddygore 
went extremely well. See the <a href=travel/buxton2006.html>Buxton 2006</a> page for pictures and links to blog entries.
<hr>
<P><STRONG>July, 2006</STRONG> - The Wumpus and I <A href="http://stanharding.livejournal.com/181635.html">went to Bermuda</A> for a quicky long-weekend vacation! Then it's a business trip to St. Paul, and finally leaving for England at the end of the month. 
<HR>
<P><STRONG>June, 2006</STRONG> - Even with the minor tweaks I've been making, the Toast Point page has gotten more attention from me in the last month or so then in the previous eight years. I blame the band! 
<P>Our big news is that we lost <A href="http://006a13a.netsolhost.com/gifs/leoonbed.jpg">our beloved cat</A>, Leopold. He was sixteen years old. There will be a Leo tribute page up here eventually, with lots of pictures. We miss our little fluffboy very much. 
<HR>
<P><STRONG>May, 2006</STRONG> - Hmm, what happened to the beginning of the year?</P>
<P>Well, the big news is that <EM>www.toastpoint.com</EM> has moved to a different host - for the first time since it was founded in 1995.&nbsp; Remember back then, when 5 mgs of space was a big deal?&nbsp; Well, <A href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network Solutions</A> gives me 3 gig!&nbsp; So I can dump all sorts of crap up here.&nbsp; You can be frightened now.&nbsp; Anyway, you can expect a lot of changes to the Toast Point Page over the next few weeks, but all content is staying, and I hope to add new stuff - music, video, all sorts of stuff.</P>
<P>A side effect of the move is I now own the domain <I>Wumpus's real name.com</I>. We haven't done anything with it yet, but he will want to use it for self-promotion at some point as he markets himself as a consultant.&nbsp; Yes, it's true, he's losing his job of 15 years.&nbsp; His office is moving to Durham, NC, and (well) he's not.&nbsp; So, his last day is in mid-August.&nbsp; Yes, it's worth his while to stay til the end, so it's <EM>not </EM>worth it for him to start interviewing yet.</P>
<P>In other news, I'm now an official Business Analyst instead of a Documentation Specialist.&nbsp; And I'm going back to Buxton (yay!) for the <A href="http://www.gs-festival.co.uk/">G&amp;S Festival</A>: I' m in the chorus for the <A href="http://web.mac.com/robertray/iWeb/Ruddygore%20Public/Ruddygore%202006.html">Savoynet Ruddygore</A>.</P>
