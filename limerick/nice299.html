Into space that is so economical<br>
But the good ones I've seen<br>
Are so seldom clean<br>
And the clean ones are so seldom comical!

A lovely young Finn who went skiing<br>
Was in love, and her boyfriend was seeing.<br>
They meet in the piste<br>
For their secretive tryste,<br>
And in no time their lips they were sealing.

An anonymous poet online<br>

That the amorous female<br>
Downloaded his email<br>

I became rather breathless and wheezy,<br>
For it came as a shock<br>
To be chased by a croc<br>
But I made it across rather queasy.

If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He would have to adapt to the way<br>
Certain words which he used<br>
Have become quite confused.<br>
For example, "The lovers were gay".
<p>The whole trouble with airlines is planes<br>
The whole trouble with railways is trains<br>
It is better by far<br>
To be out in your car<br>
And annoy people in other lanes.

Without warning emitted a moan!<br>

A croc met St. Frank of Assisi<br>

To procrastinate steals all your time<br>
Caution those who believe it's a crime ...<br>

<p>There were roofers up fixing the eaves<br>
As I came past my bank on this eve's<br>

Lay the shingles at fault ...<br>
Oh, now wait &#151 you don't say I saw thieves?
<p>A contemplative life is a monk's<br>
He's alone every night as he bunks<br>
But consoled by a thought &#151<br>
He's at least not distraught<br>
By performance-anxiety flunks!
<p>A hippity-hoppity rabbit<br>
If offered a joint, leapt to grab it ...<br>
But claimed, at no point<br>
During smoking a joint<br>
Was inhaling a part of his habit!

Mathematics: of sciences, queen<br>
Romantic of all philosophies, with branches umpteen<br>
That simplify the mystic orders of the divine universe<br>
Using numbers infinitely linked into a poetic verse<br>
It solves all, the tough, the easy and the between.

Where you email and feel and YOU CARE?<br>
It's so wild, warm and fuzzy<br>
Even if you're both scuzzy, <br>
It's OK cause you're here and (s)he's there.

My head gets all whirly<br>
After six months of clouds, who can blame it?
