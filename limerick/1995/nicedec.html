<h3>Ed Bronstein writes 12/28</h3>
A Cybergeezer entrant named Nick<br>
Was arrested for his limerick<br>
He was charged with the crime<br>
Of an imperfect rhyme<br>
"Almost rhymes," cried Nick. "What the heck!"

<hr>
<h3>Larry Dahl writes 12/28</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Newt has a plan with potential.<br>
He hopes to prove Bill non-essential.<br>
For if Clinton must go<br>
On a federal furlough,<br>
Then Newt can appear presidential.
<p>
There once was a fine music teacher<br>
With one undistinguishing feature.<br>
Whether young or quite old<br>
All her students were told<br>
They were good, and not one disbelieved her.

<hr>
<h3>Appel Fletcher writes 12/28</h3>
There once was a man named Jack<br>
Who never in rhymes would lack<br>
His family went crazy<br>
When he shared a new daisy:<br>
This proved a most serious knack.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:AppleEatng@aol.com>Charlotte</a> writes 12/22</h3>
The morning sure comes so fast.<br>
The night never seems to last.<br>
I want to sleep more!<br>
To cozy and snore.<br>
Alarm is so loud, a blast!


<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Oxymoron8@aol.com>
Oxymoron</a> writes 12/21</h3>
There once was a young lady named Lizzy.<br>
So pretty she'd make the boys dizzy.<br>
An achiever in school.<br>
This gal is no fool.<br>
But sure gets her mom in a tizzy.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:tset@vianet.on.ca>
Beeker the braindead</a> writes 12/20</h3>
There once was a man named JC.<br>
Whose love got him nailed to a tree!<br>
'Cause the world was in fear,<br>
They laughed and they cheered,<br>
As they killed the young man named JC!!
<hr>

<h3>Jim writes 12/18</h3>
There once was a poet named Jim,<br>
Whose boss took exception with him.<br>
"Can you refrain from whim verse<br>
 That makes LADIES CURSE ?"<br>
Said Jim, "that's a grim gem of an oxymorism."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Oxymoron8@aol.com>
Oxymoronic Gal</a> writes 12/14</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The holiday season is here.<br>
Time to have family be near.<br>
So come as you can<br>
By car, truck, or van<br>
And be home with me soon, won't you dear?

<hr>
<h3>Jim writes 12/14</H3>
"Stop yelling ! They're just only youngsters !"<br>
Complained I, `but they'll grow-up to be punksters.`<br>
With graffiti un-banned<br>
And spray paint at hand,<br>
`See dear, your car now looks funk'er.`
<p>
Lied he, "America, the budget I'll axe."<br>
"Only evil rich folks will I ever tax."<br>
Said US, "Honky-Tonk no more !<br>
Your tune's spent, you bore!<br>
Slick Willie, blow it out yer sax !"

<hr>
<h3>VENUS writes 12/13</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a student named Nell<br>
Who had a most terrible smell!<br>
We gave her some soap<br>
But it just was no hope<br>
So we shoved her into an old well!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:lillis@platte.unk.edu>
Conan the Librarian</a> writes a limerick about Lewis and Clark 12/13</h3>
The President sent them out West;<br>
As explorers they seemed far the best.<br>
But they hadn't a notion<br>
How far was the ocean.<br>
They were just as befogged as the rest.
<hr>

<h3><a href=mailto:ogthepoet2@aol.com>
OgThePoet2</a> writes 12/12</h3>
Scoooby-doobie-do<br>
Sinatra's eighty-two.<br>
Grandpa is eighty<br>
And so's Grandma Katy<br>
And Sinatra's eighty too!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:writerman@igc.net>
Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/12</h3>
A nasty man, old Ebenezer<br>
Was mean to his wife, the old geezer.<br>
She said, without bitchin',<br>
"Come out to the kitchen - <br>
You'll find the old boy in the freezer!"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A man of the Jewish persuasion<br>
Hated cabs - took the bus on occasion.<br>
Sounds funny, I guess<br>
But the old I.R.S.<br>
Got him for "taxi" evasion!

<hr>
<h3>Clinton Jones writes 12/11</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

Our little neighbor next door<br>
An inquisitive kid to the core<br>
He always asks why?<br>
I give it a try<br>
But I end up with questions galore!
<hr>

<h3><a href=mailto:writerman@igc.net>
Og The Poet </a> writes 12/11</h3>
T'was the night before Christmas in Cheers<br>
In walks Santa and all those Reindeers<br>
Did they drink? Have no doubt!<br>
Till the old man passed out--<br>
And Norm picked up the tab for the beers!

<hr>

<h3><a href=mailto:writerman@igc.net>
Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/10</h3>
A musician fleeing from Cuba<br>
To start a new life in Aruba<br>
Packed most of it all--<br>
But the bag was so small--<br>
He couldn't quite fit in his tuba!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:paradox@ix.netcom.com>
Oxymoronic Florida Fem</a> writes 12/9</h3>
Is snow really white after falling?<br>
Sight of yellow is surely appalling!<br>
We shovel and sweep it<br>
Try our best to heap it<br>
But the color is changed.  Just galling!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:writerman@igc.net>
Ogden Nield</a> writes 12/9</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Away with this holiday spirit!<br>
Merry Christmas? -- I don't want to hear it!<br>
You buy gifts till you're broke<br>
What you get back's a joke<br>
I don't so much hate it as fear it!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Although liquor was Ogden's delight,<br>
Ev'ry night he'd get high as a kite!<br>
"One night I abstain."<br>
He said with disdain,<br>
"New Years Eve is Amateur Night!"
<p>
He works hard for his money, he earns it!<br>
Buys a gift for his wife-- but she spurns it!<br>
It'll be the wrong size<br>
Or it won't match her eyes<br>
And I'll bet you a buck she returns it!
<p>
To whomever you happen to be:<br>
No Christmas card this year from me!<br>
I choose not to send 'em<br>
That's my new addendum!<br>
Scratch my name off your list?  Please feel free!


<hr>
<h3>Cato J. Simpson writes 12/8</h3>
A young engineer from Capri<br>
Thought thermodynamics pure glee<br>
From Maxwell to Joule<br>
Their works, as a rule<br>
Moved him perpetually.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:lillis@platte.unk.edu>
Conan the Librarian</a> submits a classic 12/8</h3>
There once was a fellow named Nick<br>
Who the good stuff from garbage would pick.<br>
The cans he would mash<br>
And turn in for cash<br>
And the jam jars he'd thoroughly lick.

<hr>
<h3>Larry Dahl writes 12/7</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

Denise has a problem with men.<br>
She never knows which one or when<br>
She ought to pursue<br>
So she puts herself through<br>
A crisis again and again.
<p>
I think that I think that I am,<br>
Thought a Pentium processor, Sam.<br>
If you take me apart<br>
You will find no Descartes<br>
Because cogito ergo, I'm Sam.
<p>
My computer can probably render<br>
A universe lacking in gender.<br>
The point of creation<br>
In this simulation<br>
Is something I fail to remember.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

With a trusty workstation I'd render<br>
An alternative world without gender<br>
Though I fear that I might<br>
Simulate in the night<br>
A world which is even less tender.
<p>
My computer thinks I cannot see<br>
That he thinks he is smarter than me.<br>
If I trip on the rug,<br>
It might pull out his plug.<br>
And accidents happen to me.

<hr>
<h3>Pete Wilson writes 12/7</h3>
There once was a Gov named J. Brown;<br>
To some, he was only a clown.<br>
As Gov, it would seem<br>
They called him Moonbeam<br>
And now he's the talk of the town.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:paradox2@ix.netcom.com>paradox2@ix.netcom.com</a> 
writes 12/7</h3>
There once was an ego immense.<br>
I'm sure he's a member of Mense.<br>
But his style is poor.<br>
In fact, he's a bore.<br>
If I told him, he'd sure take offense.

<hr>
<h3>Sara writes 12/6</h3>
There once was a young boy named Zack<br>
Who had something stuck in his back<br>
It wouldn't come out<br>
He wanted to shout <br>
And launch a counterattack.

<hr>
<H3>Larry Dahl writes 12/5</h3>
My mother believed me exchanged<br>
At the hospital rather than changed.<br>
She said that the others,<br>
My sister and brothers,<br>
Were never so nearly deranged.
<p>
My brother's a natural detective<br>
For by nature he's somewhat protective.<br>
And he's never been blind<br>
To the criminal mind,<br>
Except when he has an objective.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I'm probably wasting my time<br>
Perfecting a limerick's rhyme.<br>
It's better to give them<br>
Immaculate rhythm<br>
For then they can reach the sublime.

<HR>
<h3>Conan the Librarian shares a classic 12/4</h3>
An epicure dining at Crewe<br>
Found quite a large mouse in his stew.<br>
Said the waiter, "Don't shout<br>
And wave it about,<br>
Or the rest will be wanting some too!"


<hr>
<h3>Larry Dahl writes 12/3</h3>
If you study the silver haired Newt,<br>
You will find he thinks orphans are cute.<br>
He's especially bold<br>
When attacking the old<br>
For he's blind, deaf, and dumb, but not mute.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Sharon Stone is so icily stunning,<br>
Not to mention deceptive and cunning.<br>
A woman like she<br>
Could make any man flee<br>
But he'd surely look back while he's running.
<p>
Stephen Hawking can prove with a plot<br>
Whether we will or will not<br>
Expand without limit<br>
Or end in an intimate<br>
Space which is all in one spot.
<p>
Our greatest American actor<br>
Is De Niro and clearly a factor<br>
Behind this impression<br>
Is his deep obsession<br>
With being a pure malefactor.
<p>
A computer could give me the power<br>
To graphically morph Hoover Tower<br>
So from all points of sight<br>
It leans left and not right<br>
So beneath it Republicans cower.
<p>
The candidate Patrick Buchanan<br>
Is armed with the biblical canon.<br>
He preaches hellfire<br>
So draws a crossfire.<br>
Even God cannot help Pat Buchanan.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align=right>
Though our forces salute General Powell,<br>
There's no candidate he'll disembowel.<br>
For he'd only run<br>
If he'd already won<br>
And the others had thrown in the towel.

<hr>
<h3>Roma writes 12/3</h3>
While trimming the tree with the tinsel<br>
Adjusting the lights was essential<br>
So I took hold of the wire <br>
And started a fire   <br>
And that was the end of the tinsel.

<hr>
<h3>Spencer writes 12/2</h3>
A backcatcher who hailed from Peru,<br>
Told me one day what he'd do.<br>
When they'd come up to bat,<br>
He'd say "Yo' mama's so fat,<br>
Her blood type is known as Ragu!"

<hr>

<h3>Ogden Nield writes 12/2</h3>
Beelzebub, horned and fiery<br>
Among other things was a liar. He<br>
Would wish someone well - <br>
Then he'd make his life hell -<br>
And write it all down in his diary!<p>

Mrs. Gingrich's baby was cute<br>
"I know," she said, "let's call him Newt!"<br>
Back then, just a leaker -<BR>
Today he's "The Speaker"<br>
Must he always wear that same suit?


<hr>
<h3>Larry Dahl pontificates on politicians and computers 12/1</h3>
On my high resolution display<br>
My computer turns work into play.<Br>
I catch politicians<br>
In awkward positions,<br>
And morph their excuses away.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
My computer will morph Robert Dole<br>
So his features resemble his soul.<br>
But wait!  That's no fun.<br>
It's already been done.<br>
No wonder he can't win a poll!
<p>
I think I can give Ross Perot<br>
Image help with his upcoming show.<br>
Though he's got lots of money,<br>
He still looks too funny.<br>
Those ears really do have to go.
<p>
With the help of an honest workstation<br>
I'd select all the heads of our nation.<br>
Those who win and who lose<br>
I would randomly choose,<br>
To dispense with all false explanation.

<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align=right alt="Gold Star!">
Computers were clearly elated<br>
When a PC courageously stated<br>
That men have no place<br>
In the silicon race<br>
And that rocks are more closely related.
<p>
When I start my own silly Web site<br>
My computer will burst with delight.<br>
I'll compress in his files<br>
Incipient smiles<br>
And satirical bits with more bite.
