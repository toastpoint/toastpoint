<h3>Anonymous sweeps the Current Events category:</h3>
Newt Gingrich, the head of the House<br>
Once fell in love with my spouse<br>
"I'll divorce you!" I screamed<br>
"If you DARE touch his thing!"<br>
She said, "Don't worry, it's as small as a mouse!"<p>

<h3>A poet who might be anyone, but is Michael Donn, 
wins the Public Transportation category:</h3>
A hard-headed cabby named Peter<br>
Was asked by a fare if he'd eat her.<br>
He said, "It's not free.<br>
I will only agree<br>
To go down while I'm running the meter."

<h3>53-MERC takes the "Manners" competition with this genteel entry:</h3>
Dildos are touchy at best<br>
especially applied to a guest.<br>
"I imagined a meal,<br>
Not a long latex eel,"<br>
One huffy invitee confessed.
<hr>
<h2>Dishonorable Mention</h2>
<h3>Chumley writes 7/24</h3>
Lady F. is a frigid gold-digger<br>
Who suffers from mortis de rigor<br>
So cold she scares mice<br>
Her sucking on ice<br>
Doesn't melt the cube, but makes it bigger.
<hr>

<h3>53-MERC writes 7/14</h3>
Dildos are touchy at best<br>
But they'll not let you down at the crest;<br>
First, jiggled, then twisted,<br>
Then rapidly fisted,<br>
They'll outlast ten peckers if pressed.<br>
<i>Note: the sage likes this, but prefers 53-MERC's winning entry above.</i>
<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 7/13</h3>
The tile in my bathroom is striking<br>
The girl in my shower's a dykeling<br>
She's a sweet fine young thing<br>
and she makes my heart sing<br>
And performs very much to my liking
<hr>
<h3>53-MERC writes 7/13</h3>
"A horror of pink cotton candy"<br>
Was the way that I'd once described Mandy,<br>
But she proved me untrue<br>
When her fingers just flew -<br>
she's not only randy but handy.
<hr>
<h3>Hefty writes 7/10</h3>
There once was a man from Darjeeling<br>
Who played with his tool with such feeling<br>
When he finally shot<br>
All the fluid he'd got<br>
He had covered the walls and the ceiling
<hr>

<h3>Mark writes 7/10</h3>
One day horny young bulls in Petroff<br>
Had no cows with whom to get off.<br>
They couldn't stand waiting,<br>
Began masturbating:<br>
The invention of Beef Strokingoff!
<hr>

<h3>Muriel writes 7/3</h3>
Benny just makes this girl shiver<br>
Just thinking of Bjorn my loins quiver<br>
When I start to spasm<br>
For a girl-girl orgasm<br>
Agnetha and Frida deliver!
