<h3>Observer writes 09/30/98</h3>
A large crab did decide to embark<br>
On a stroll, on the beach, in the dark.<br>
It crawled over the feet<br>
Of young lovers in heat,<br>
And inspired frantic screams of "HELP!! SHARK!!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ad@dcs.st-and.ac.uk>Tony Davie</a> writes 09/30/98</h3>
The pawn's move is subtle and dang-<br>
-erous. One square or two it can range.<br>
It takes on the slant.<br>
Move backwards it can't<br>
And en passant is even more strange.

Mathematics: of sciences, queen<br>
Electronics: technology's dean ...<br>
Yet each bows in great awe<br>
When it meets Murphy's Law &#151<br>
Still the ruler of earthly routine!

<h3>Beelzebub writes 09/29/98</h3>
When an angel is only thirteen<br>
One must not be excessively mean;<br>
But I have to confess<br>
That with Z or with S<br>
It's the zorriest zpeller I've zeen!

What a pity, a shame, and disgrace!<br>
A beelzebub's put in its place,<br>
By a child of thirteen,<br>
Oh, how neat, oh how keen,<br>
The devil has egg on its face!

Said the Hare to the Tortoise, "Dear chap,<br>
I can catch you with ease, so I'll nap" ...<br>
Round a bend, Tortoise crept<br>
While the Hare overslept &#151<br>
And then lost, 'cos he can't read a map!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "What Aesop didn't know about fables could fill a
whole Web site"</i>
<p>

Now the Iliad's over and done<br>
And the battle of Trojans is won ...<br>
No fear Homer would nod &#151<br>

A curious mammal's the beaver:<br>
Its scent gland's a perfume retriever<br>
Its teeth gnaw down trees<br>
With such consummate ease<br>
And its tail is a dam-building lever!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The pronunciation of the final word reveals on which side of the pond 
this mammal was lodged until
relatively recently ... the side with more rodent ode on't"</i>

A charming and sensitive spider<br>
Had long grieved that Love was denied her.<br>
There came a young male,<br>
Who was sweet, but small-scale -<br>
So she ate him, and that satisfied her.

<h3><a href=mailto:melissam@bedfordtg.com>Melissa Markham</a> writes 09/25/98</h3>
In the governor's towering house<br>
There lived a mischievous mouse<br>
He played in the kitchen<br>
He ate just a smidgen<br>
And he loved to frighten old Kraus!
<p>
There was once a man so tall<br>
That all he could do was fall<br>
He cursed his ill luck<br>
But for half of a buck<br>
You could get him to scrunch up real small!

So your murders for me<br>
Are with transcendent virtue imbued.

Involved a quite minor concussion.<br>

He fell off of the stage.<br>
The drum that he played was percussion.

<h3>Andy Onymous writes 09/24/98</h3>
If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He would surely get carried away<br>
With writing nude scenes<br>
For buff kings and queens<br>

Mr Smith's the role critics rate high<br>
But I liked him the most<br>
Playing Harvey's good host &#151<br>
An eccentric ... but then, so am I!
<p>Steve Fossett's balloon locomotion<br>
Had circling the world for a notion ...<br>
He ballooned night and day<br>
For two thirds of the way &#151<br>
But then fell with a splash in the ocean!

<i>The poet comments, "Happened a while back, but I'm still catching up on old news ..."</i>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vertechinc.com/derive.htm">Vertech Inc.</a> contest's so huffy<br>
Thinks 9-9-6-6-9's too puffy<br>

<h3>Beelzebub writes 09/21/98</h3>
Teen Angel - such wit, so sincere!<br>

Then - with help from its Dad -<br>
The riposte took a mere half a year!

A goldfish whom circling frustrated<br>
Leapt into a square tank, elated ...<br>
His joy was soon dashed:<br>
At corners he crashed &#151<br>
Glass ahead wasn't anticipated!

<i>The poet comments,<br>
"Though my earlier entry's absurd<br>
'Cos I've learnt pate the verb's not a word<br>

First I got garden pond fever.<br>
Now my poor wife's a believer.<br>
She's out in the pond<br>
just trimming a frond.<br>
Think I'll go try to retrieve her.

She said, "No, the water's too warm.<br>
I must keep my fishies from harm."<br>
So in goes the ice.<br>
(A pick-up full... twice!)<br>
Ya think I have cause for alarm?
<p>
Just want her to come back to bed.<br>
She's cleaning the filter instead.<br>
I swear that she drools<br>
when thinking of schools<br>
of fish spawning out by the shed.
<p>
Soon with this pond stuff she'll smother<br>
Her husband, two daughters, her mother.<br>
She drives us crazy <br>
With, "Pond is too hazy."<br>

Two brothers bought some new digs,<br>
Started raising cattle and pigs.<br>
Their dad said, "For fame<br>
You need a good name."<br>

So their father the boys did entreat<br>
He said,"Boys, dont blanch,<br>
Call the place 'Focus Ranch,<br>
'Cause that's where the sun's rays meet."

An obnoxious five-year old brat,<br>
Was pulling the tail of the cat,<br>
Mom said, "Quit and sit," <br>
He threw a fit,<br>
She paddled him right where he sat!

There was a young dog with a pup,<br>
Who ate his food from a cup.<br>
He ate a rat<br>
And then a cat<br>
And then went outside to throw up.
<p>Where, oh where, did those publishers flee,<br>
Where, oh where, can they be?<br>
I'm in a bind.<br>
I just cannot find<br>
Those publishers who are hiding from me.

Fred's heart attack, while on the links,<br>
Was tragic and fatal, methinks.<br>
It was on hole thirteen,<br>
At the edge of the green;<br>
So we shlepped him five holes and had drinks.

<h3>Mr. Work writes 09/01/98</h3>
Enough of that Ken Starr Buttinski <br>
And his grilling of poor Miss Lewinsky<br>
Just give Ted a pardon<br>
A bomb and a carton<br>
And call it even with Kaczynski.

<h3>Observer writes 08/31/98</h3>
A famous shoe salesman, Al Bundy,<br>
Sold shoes every day, except Sunday.<br>
He said, "Life's a bore,<br>
Working in a shoe store,<br>
I'd rather be Crocodile Dundee!"
