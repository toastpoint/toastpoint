So she fell with both arms<br>
For Technology's charms<br>
And begat the computing machine!
<p>
An eagle whose wings had been clipped<br>
Was Delilah's &#151 oh boy, how she flipped:<br>
"If the culprit I find<br>
I will punish in kind!" ...<br>
As you know, Samson's locks were all snipped

A goldfish whom circling frustrated,<br>
Was bloated and quite constipated.<br>
A long skinny eel,<br>
Asked, "What's the big deal?<br>
Your belly is over-inflated!

The ends with their sacking vocation,<br>
Enclose the line in quotation,<br>
From the snap they'll dash,<br>
And meet at the Slash,<br>
For it's all in their punctuation.

The fans of Barry and crew,<br>
Bedecked in Honolu' Blue,<br>
Must fret ev'ry match,<br>
Now that life is a Batch,<br>
From Detroit to Kalamazoo.

<p>
Into the doghouse he's shooed,<br>
Whenever the ball comes unglued;<br>
His spirit is vervy,<br>
And path of'en swervy,<br>
He's Green Bay's surfer dude.

The hawk's flying around,<br>
In the sky there is no sound.<br>
As I see his shadow overhead,<br>
It is good that there is no blood that's red.<br>
Around me because I am not dead.

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">After Tuesday's electoral push<br>
GOP brothers George and Jeb Bush<br>
Have four years to complete<br>
On the governor's seat &#151<br>
Or the gubernatorial tush!
<p>
Though the Dems gained a bit more authority<br>
While Republicans kept their majority<br>
The result most to note<br>
About yesterday's vote<br>
Is incumbents have more seniority!

A Mother gave birth to a crowd!<br>
Quadruplets, of which she is proud!<br>
Bottle and diaper,<br>
Makes a Mom hyper,<br>
Multiply that, four crying out loud!

One day when Sarah was but four<br>
A clown came knocking at her door<br>
Ahe sat and cried<br>
Till at last he died<br>
Then he never came back no more.

Toast Point is the greatest web site<br>
For sharing the lim'ricks you write,<br>
And if you please the Sage,<br>
You can display the page,<br>
And gaze at the stars day or night!

<h4>Smokers</h4>
You smokers, take note, I have something to say:<br>
If you want to get cancer, by me it's OK.<br>
        But here is my fight:<br>
        You don't have the right<br>
 To use the whole world as your private ash tray.
<p>
<h3>Doorways</h3>
To loll in a doorway is quite commonplace.<br>
 It's thoughtless and shows a distinct lack of grace.<br>
       Now here is my riddle:<br>
       Why stand in the middle,<br>
 When inside or outside, there's plenty of space?

Hey, waiter, my soup's got a hair in!<br>
Don't mean to be cussin' and swearin',<br>
But, I'm gettin' sick,<br>
You need to come quick<br>
And remove this surprise that you're sharin'!

November, November, November<br>
A time to give thanks and remember ...<br>
Unless you're the tom<br>
That the meal's taken from &#151<br>
Then, too early, you've reached your December!
