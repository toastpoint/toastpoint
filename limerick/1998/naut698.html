There once was a King, first name Larry<br>
Who seven women did marry<br>
He isn't so pleasin'<br>
Maybe that is the reason<br>
Why none of the girls, long, did tarry.
<p>
There's an Arkansas airport called Mena<br>
Which is in Mr. Clinton's arena.<br>
Passing this domain<br>
There was lots of cocaine<br>
For which he should be served a subpoena.

She said she would like to be weighed.<br>
And I said, "Why's that, pretty maid?"<br>
"I wuv you a wot<br>
And I know what you've got,<br>
And that's why I want to be waid."
<p>
She withheld her affairs with fullbacks.<br>
She withheld how she felt about climax.<br>
She withheld from her mate<br>
Every secret bedmate,<br>
But she pays a huge withholding tax.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Fullbacks?  What are they?"</i>

For one little blue pill, Mr Beck<br>
Gave his Doctor a very large cheque.<br>
The Doc, from Nantucket<br>
Said, "Swallow, don't suck it  -<br>
Or you'll get a very stiff neck "

There once was a man from Bombast<br>
Whose balls were made out of brass<br>
when they clanked together <br>
They played "Stormy Weather"<br>
And lighting shot out of his ass!
<p>
There once was a man of Belfast <br>
Whose balls out of iron were Cast<br>
He'd managed somehow<br>
To bugger a sow<br>
Thus you get pig iron at last.

Slick's China jaunt cost a gazillion<br>
I lied! It was 45 million<br>
5 more than Starr spent<br>
On lawyers and rent<br>
Whose  damn expense account's Willie on?

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Could not BELIEVE our giverment spent 45 mil to send one stone wall to visit another."</i>

The Chinese built Hillary  a potty<br>
For 26 thou it ain't shoddy<br>

There once was a gay caballero<br>
Who wanted to make some dinero.<br>
He went up to Reno<br>
And won playing Keno<br>
But, then lost it all playing Faro.

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> shares a classic 06/27/98</h3>
In the White House, there's some tattletale<br>
Who is selling some lies by retail.<br>
As I entered the room,<br>
I did smell perfume,<br>
But I left and I didn't inhale.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net47>Popsicle</a> writes 06/26/98</h3>
As I was reading over my e-mail<br>
I came across a note from a female<br>
I went out and met her<br>
But it would have been better<br>
If "she" hadn't been a gay he-male.
<p>
When people engage in acts amorous<br>
Hollywood thinks that it's glamorous<br>
When couples get nude<br>
And start to act lewd<br>
They get out their video cameras.
<p>
There was a young fellow named Walter<br>
Who his sex he wanted to alter<br>
Upon the completion<br>
Of the penile deletion<br>
He could feel his manliness falter.
<p>
A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>
Conducted a mass in his jeans<br>
When the bishop found out<br>
He was soon heard to shout<br>
"This priest must have defective Genes."
<p>
There was an ex-submariner named Guido<br>
Who had a tremendous libido<br>
When he got around women <br>
He couldn't go swimmin'<br>
Because of his magnificent torpedo.
<p>
Oh, father!  I have a confession!<br>
I admit that I have this obsession<br>
I heard the men of the cloth'll<br>
Very soon open a brothel<br>
And I'd just love to have the concession!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sorry, it dosn't meter very well, but then what the hell."</i>
<p>
Bill Clinton sits there on his throne<br>
While poor Hillary sleeps all alone<br>
His name ain't Horatio<br>
But he just loves Fellatio<br>
He loves to hear young interns moan.
<p>
We watch Bill with utmost suspicion<br>
Because of his peculiar condition<br>
All you ladies watch out <br>
For this lecherous lout<br>
Who has no nocturnal emission.

<p>
A bearded old biker named Charlie<br>
Took a very long ride on his Harley.<br>
He knew that his hog, <br>
Created no smog<br>
'Cause he ran it on hops and malt barley.

<p>He rode the state of Virginia,<br>
Which is very far from Gdinya.<br>
He picked up a girl<br>
Who he took for a whirl<br>
And when done, said,"I'd like to get in ya."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip/net>Popsicle</a> writes 06/25/98</h3>
There was a young intern named Monica<br>
Who took a short trip to Salonika<br>
That's pretty far south<br>
But when she opened her mouth<br>
It wasn't to play the harmonica

<p>
Though a Roosevelt fan I was not<br>
I never really liked him a lot<br>
But old Franklin R.<br>
Was better by far<br>
Than this miserable bastard we;ve got.

<h3>H writes another epic 6/26</h3>
<h4>Aliens in Africa</h4>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The Mool came to Earth in Tangiers<br>
(An alien race with big ears,<br>
Their stature was small -<br>
Nigh twelve inches tall)<br>
In search of Earth music and beers.
<p>
Moroccan brew? - thought it quite stank.<br>
Afro Pop? - sounded quite rank.<br>
They met a black whore<br>
And asked “Is there more?”<br>
She: “Put on this Walkman and crank.”
<p>
Amused with the Mool (who were drunk),<br>
She played ‘em some Hendrix and Monk.<br>
Warm Guinness she poured.<br>
T. Monk they adored,<br>
And raved over Jimi’s sweet funk.
<p>
She let a Mool climb in her ‘bin’<br>
And crank up his Walkman to ten.<br>
‘Twas quite a snug fit -<br>
She cared not a bit<br>
As “Voodoo Chile” throbbed from within.
<p>
Now, deep inside her crevasse,<br>
(Thank God Mool have gills like a bass!)<br>
The stout made him belch,<br>
Which tightened the felch,<br>
And built up a nice head of gas.
<p>
She came with a blast and they parted.<br>
Flying through space the Mool darted.<br>
She charged ‘em no fee,<br>
Exclaiming with glee,<br>
“A Mool and his Sony - poon-farted!”
<p>
<i>In response to the poet's question, that's not how Toast Point would have used the word <b>felch</b>.  
Toast Point informs his readers that when he and the Wumpus were dating, he made 
the Wumpus gape in shock simply by using the f-lch word casually.  It was quite amusing.</i>

<h3>Squeaky writes 06/25/98</h3>
I was anxious to check logging in,<br>
My latest work in your naughty joke bin.<br>
I worked my fat butt off,<br>
But still missed your cut-off,<br>
When will my ten brand new Limericks get in?
<p>
<i>Well, now, obviously.  Toast Point reminds <b>all</b> his readers that as much as he loves running 
this contest, he is a <b>very</b> busy boy and can't always update it every day.</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 06/24/98</h3>
This medicine man was a hoot.<br>
He was wearing his birthday suit.<br>
He served me roach tea,<br>
And he waved some gris gris.<br>
Then he boldly displayed his big root.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "If you know about voodoo, you will know about gris gris."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:jdschr@philly.infi.net>Squeaky</a> writes 06/24/98</h3>
That investigation of Starr's a big mess,<br>
Who's winning is hard to assess.<br>
The team we implore,<br>
Can't quite even the score,<br>
And few know as much as the press

<p>
Does Ken think that he's Elliot Ness,<br>
With the authority that he could express?<br>
Do you think when Starr vents,<br>
He can scare the defense?<br>
Hell, at times he acts like he's wearing a dress.
<p>
His performance does hardly impress,<br>
Those who think that the girl did undress.<br>
Did Bill try to deceive her?<br>
Few seem to believe her.<br>
But why would she say it? No less.

<p>This whole effort could use some largess,<br>
Any info would help him, I guess.<br>
From Bill's likeness of girls,<br>
To the lives he unfurls,<br>
But, I doubt Starr does this much possess.
<p>
For the investigation to really progress,<br>
He should show some unselfishness.<br>
Stop his verbal attacks,<br>
And the leaking of facts,<br>
'Cause he'll lose if the defense smells duress.
<p>
So it's onward the prosecutors will press,<br>
These guys won't be happy with less.<br>
Than to please the Grand Jury,<br>
With their side of the story.<br>
Any win for new careers to caress.

<p>
But the whole thing has begun to regress,<br>
Starr should admit that he's lost it, unless,<br>
The evidentiary phase,<br>
Starts to garner him praise,<br>
And he overrules Clinton'e move to suppress.

<p>
It's reminiscent of an old game of chess,<br>
Pretty much, but it causes more stress.<br>
How long can we bear?<br>
To continue's not fair.<br>
Calling off all the dogs we would bless.
<p>
But, alas, even Starr must confess,<br>
Sooner or later, he's got to address.<br>
That his image ain't funny,<br>
Wasting taxpayers money.<br>
My vote whether to end it is......Yes!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is not nearly as long, original or entertaining as the Hiftlorss Saga.  Some of the creativity
is unbelievable.  At site I will visit again and again.  Will contribute more."</i>

She seemed different some how as he kissed her,<br>
Regardless, he could hardly resist her.<br>
But his shock was for real,<br>
As he copped for a feel,<br>
And found the "girl" that he kissed was a Mister!

<p>
Bill Clinton's no man of conviction<br>
Avoiding truth is a lifelong affliction.<br>
Mixes lies with the facts,<br>
We can never relax.<br>
To him, truth is stranger than fiction.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This Limerick business resulted from a family get-together as we were trying
 to remmember all those "good ones" we rememberd camping and such.  As 
they say on Seinfeld, "Yadda, yadda, yadda" and we have composed over 
a hundred of these rascals since May of 1998.<p>

(some of which we've seen before)<p>
<h4>Alien Snuff Sex!!! XXXx50x50!!!</h4>

An alien Hiftlorss named Xirth<br>
Let fifty space men in her berth.<br>
She had fifty cunts<br>
With vibrating shunts -<br>
A cluster-fuck like none on Earth!
<p>

Soon the whole crew had stiff poles,<br>
Her twats started smoking like coals,<br>
When each little sac room<br>
Went slam on full vacuum,<br>
And sucked all their balls through their holes!
<p>

<i>And the moral of the story:<br>
(drought is the ‘-outh’ pronunciation)</i>
<p>

At light speed when nookie’s a-drought,<br>
Just let all old adage go south.<br>
If you may choose,<br>
Don’t cunt-shoot your ooze:<br>
Best gook a Hiftlorss in the mouth.
<p>

An alien Hiftlorss named Ned<br>
Took twenty-five space-girls to bed.<br>
He had fifty pricks -<br>
They stuck out like sticks -<br>
Around his whole torso they spread.
<p>

Each wang was a foot long and thin -<br>
The tips like the head of a pin.<br>
The girls smiled in shock,<br>
For each skinny cock<br>
Could vibrate and pulsate and spin.
<p>

The flat little glanses, mere dots,<br>
Did tickle the depths of their pots.<br>
Occasionally one tip<br>
Would get a good grip -<br>
They’d puff up like doggy-dick knots.
<p>

Each mounted a wand from the front,<br>
Then pulled of a wonderful stunt:<br>
Ned’s extra score-five<br>
Each got a face dive -<br>
They had one for mouth, one for cunt.
<p>

Soon each choad entered full bloom,<br>
Displacing both glottis and womb.<br>
The girls were all stuck,<br>
When tragedy struck:<br>
Hiftlorsses must come in a vacuum.
<p>

Ned needed suction intense,<br>
The better his spuz to dispense.<br>
The girls got a shock:<br>
Into the air lock<br>
Ned drug them, all stuck to his splints.
<p>

Honking like horns make of brass,<br>
The Hiftlorss let out all the gas.<br>
Pussies a-schism,<br>
The alien’s jism<br>
Erupted and slew them in masse.
<p>

The moral, from adage is snatched.<br>
Be sure that your species is matched.<br>
A curious schtup<br>
Could blow you right up.<br>
Best count your dicks ‘fore they are latched.
<p>

After you've read this, dear crew,<br>
You'll know that my mind has now blew.<br>
I beg you not crack<br>
Like I have. (alack!)<br>
Just light off a flame when you're through...
<p>

You may know the story of Xirth<br>
And space-balls, how now there’s a dearth.<br>
And then there was Ned<br>
Who seized quim and head,<br>
And blew the space-girls beyond Earth.
<p>

Another old Hiftlorss named Xat<br>
Was mongously purple and fat.<br>
(Most Hiftlorss, my lads,<br>
Have fifty gonads,<br>
And dangerous gonads at that.)
<p>

Xat was fat, smelly, and coy -<br>
By ‘lorss standards, quite the sex toy.<br>
Unusually too,<br>
Xat had fifty-two,<br>
And wasn’t a girl nor a boy.
<p>

The “trogg” they have named this third sex<br>
Whose sex pockets do a strange flex:<br>
They turn half in-out.<br>
Small glanses they sprout,<br>
All mounted on pistil-like necks.
<p>

They don’t ‘xactly come in huge fits -<br>
It’s like a great oozing of zits.<br>
The dick-things just drool -<br>
The cunt-holes stay cool<br>
While pheromones fizz from their pits.
<p>

The troggies of Hiftlorss are spoiled -<br>
Their delicate limbs never soiled.<br>
They’re worshipped like queens<br>
And fed on rare beans,<br>
And sung to, and massaged, and oiled.
<p>

Their purpose is not to be had,<br>
But only to fart just a tad,<br>
And watch others feek,<br>
And let off a reek<br>
That drives ‘lorsses sexually mad.
<p>

(“Feek” is a Hiftlorss grand stunt<br>
Where every hose bastes every bundt.<br>
Two dance in a swirl,<br>
And go “‘round the world”<br> -
That’s fifty squared ways to dip cunt!)
<p>

Xat lost two dingles last year -<br>
A feeker crashed into its rear<br>
And severed the stalks,<br>
But surgeons, with caulks,<br>
Stuck on a pair of new gear.<br>
<p>

But if your good trogg is quite pleased<br>
With you and your partner’s fine deeds,<br>
It rolls on its rear,<br>
And lets you draw near<br>
And lick, but not suck, from its reeds.
<p>

The troggs are a mendicant caste<br>
Who travel in ships vast and fast.<br>
There’re only a few,<br>
And couples must queue<br>
To wait for their turn to get gassed.
<p>

Now Xat was to spend a full week<br>
In Xirth’s county, augmenting feek.<br>
It went to Xirth’s home<br>
And sat on the throne<br>
Reserved for a trogg just to peek.
<p>

Now Xirth was a jaded old whore -<br>
E’en feek was becoming a bore.<br>
She massaged old Xat<br>
And took notice that<br>
It had fifty ‘nads plus two more.
<p>

A freak clearly was just the thing<br>
To give Xirth’s old coot-holes a zing.<br>
She felt them grow warm,<br>
And sooner than norm,<br>
She summoned her partner to fling.
<p>

Their feek was quite splendid to heed -<br>
A twenty-five hundred shot deed!<br>
Xirth’s love-tubes were sore<br>
Yet still she craved more -<br>
Xat beckoned the lovers to feed!
<p>

Each fragrant drop of Xat’s dew<br>
The lovers through trembling lips drew.<br>
But on fifty one,<br>
Xat’s tip-bud had none,<br>
And likewise none on fifty two!
<p>

Xirth and her male forgot custom<br>
And softly, but surely, then bussed ‘em.<br>
Anathema that -<br>
To suck a trogg’s bat.<br>
Indeed, Xat then terribly cussed ‘em!
<p>

The townsfolk then broke out their sticks,<br>
And struck them with brickbats and kicks<br>
Until they were raw.<br>
For this is the law:<br>
You can’t leech an old trogg’s new dicks.

Five lines, bawdy and terse<br>

With poems seduced me<br>
Just like going from bed to verse.

A Navaho brave in a hogan<br>
Would poke his dick into a brogan.<br>
When his tribe called him queer,<br>
He replied with good cheer,<br>
"Fuck shoe", for that was his slogan.

<i>The poet comments, "The original limerick had an Apache for a subject.  
A little research revealed that it was the Navaho who lived in hogans. 
So this is an edited version of the original..author unknown. (a brogan is a heavy shoe)"</i>

<h4>Viagramormoniaism</h4>
A Mormon who moved west to Reno,<br>
Lost his fortune at poker and Keno.<br>
He ran out of luck<br>
And lost his last buck,<br>
While drinking some doctored up Vino.
<p>
So he married a 21 dealer,<br>
Who was also a very fine peeler.<br>
They moved to Niagra,<br>
And peddled bogus Viagra<br>
To Veterans and surviving New Dealers.
<p>
They found profitable professions,<br>
Giving old farts penile erections.<br>
And the company Pfizer,<br>
Was never the wiser,<br>
Despite all the phony prescriptions.
