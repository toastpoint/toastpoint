My deductions I find are not lawful<br>
Of taxes I sure have a crawful<br>
Should have first got the facts--<br>
Now I'll just pay the tax<br>
But isn't this limerick just awful!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Wonderful??? Guess you could say that.  Toast Point asks where I've been.
Busy, busy, busy.  Too busy to make up good limericks, it seems."</i>

The Prez, with his wife on safari,<br>
Taking pictures in darkest Dhaktari,<br>
To a rhino, with a wink, said,<br>
"What do you think, Ted?<br>
Oh, you're not Kennedy!,  I'm so sorry!"

<h4>Joseph Horton Schwartz, III, A Polo Player</h4>
Twas a player who rode a grey horse<br>
Who was gelded and played like a cross<br>
Between dam and a sire<br>
With the spirit of fire<br>
Who loved him and he never did toss.

A seismologist, describing a quake<br>
Said, "Everything started to shake."<br>

Were not scientific,<br>
But those were the words that he spake.

Ran 'round in his toga,<br>
Not practicing yoga,<br>
But pinching the Vestals with a tweezer?

There once was an engine that could<br>
Run smoothly on coal or on wood.<br>
It chugged up a grade--<br>
Thought we had it made<br>
'Til it slowed to a halt and just stood.

His sister had kept a cool head<br>
On finding the snake in her bed;<br>

Of their dear father in there instead.

Mr. Gock lived on beefsteak so tough<br>
That one day, having suffered enough,<br>
His salivary glands<br>
Fled to far distant lands,<br>
And his stomach walked out in a huff.

And mistook him somehow for a tree!

Such wisdom that comes from the Sage<br>
Would suggest that he's from the Stone Age.<br>
His age ends in three,<br>
Of a year that's A. D.<br>
But I'll bet that you can't guess his age.
<p>
<i>Nor would he want you to...</i>

<h3>Beelzebub writes 03/26/98</h3>

His temper was horrid and hatable.<br>

His wife, Mary Ann;<br>
And she was both dumb and inflatable.

What went 5-6-5 quite recently?<br>
A misdialed phone call on TV? <br>
No, what 5-6-5 makes<br>
Is how many Great Lakes<br>
Congress thought, then rethought, there should be!

<h3>KJR writes 03/25/98</h3>
I once met this girl from down under<br>
With a voice like the rolling of thunder<br>
Two horns and a tail -- Can<br>

You can only catch mad cow disease<br>
From an unhappy cow's nasty sneeze<br>
Even worse (and I shudder)<br>
Is a squirt from her udder<br>
And this is no bull, if you please.

With a right puzzled look on his pan<br>
"Second star to the right"<br>

Sailed off on the good ship Titanic<br>
The iceberg - it stunned her<br>
And as she went under<br>
Her manic attack became panic!

<h3>Sumaq writes 03/24/98</h3>
Don't you love the American way<br>
Where freedom and justice have sway?<br>
Until guilt is proved<br>
You're an innocent dude<br>
Unless you're elected today.
<p>
I don't have the slightest desire<br>
To sing in political choir<br>
Where guilt is assumed<br>
No innocence tuned<br>
And the score is by hot tongues of fire!<p>
I suspect that it's not low inflation<br>
But gossip that runs this great nation.<br>
What a hunger have we<br>
The next scandal or three<br>
Give us something for our mastication.<p>
It's not that we all have desire<br>
To see politicians on fire, <br>
Its just that the news<br>
Has no way to cruise<br>
Unless it can steep us in mire.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sorry, y'all, I've just been bored with political news of late."</i>

<h3>RenWa writes 03/24/98</h3>
Rush Limbaugh is on day and night,<br>
Espousing his views from the Right.<br>
He loves making waves,<br>
So he rants and he raves.<br>
Which causes the Left to ignite!
<p>
Some callers to Art Bell are weird.<br>
Some funny, some crazy, some feared.<br>
  Conspiracies abound.<br>
  And most are unsound,<br>
Like those where the aliens appeared...

The guy was a real vigilante.<br>
I refer to the poet named Dante.<br>

He'd throw you in Hell.<br>

Said Ophelia to the prince, "Now, look, Hamlet,<br>
I do not find mirth in this gambit!<br>
The nunnery sounds grim,<br>
But methinks it's your whim,<br>
I like it sir, NOT! Not a damn bit!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "More apologies to The Bard."</i>
<p>Thrown up on the shore from the sea,<br>

For a movie in which an old grunt<br>
Finds a waitress who softens his front<br>
And whose oneness with pets<br>
Is as good as it gets<br>
There were Oscars for Nicholson, Hunt!
<p>
<i>Yeah, like Jack needed another one.  Yeah for Helen Hunt, though, who gave the nicest 
speech of the evening.</i>

You can only catch mad cow disease<br>
Eating beef ... but from pork pie 'n' peas<br>
You can catch mad pig 'flu<br>
And from eating lamb stew<br>
You can catch mad sheep sickness with ease!
<p>(On the subject of steak and pork rib<br>
Vegetarians can be very glib ...<br>
We're just jealous that meat<br>
Now's so darn cheap to eat<br>
While they've hiked veggie prices -- no fib!)

The Oscars - the talk of the town,<br>
Each star in tuxedo or gown.<br>
But something went wrong,<br>
And the show took as long<br>
As Titanic took in going down!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is what happens when I stay up too late to watch the Oscars..."</i>

Any newbie sax player<br>
To kneel down in prayer<br>
Vainly trying to learn all Joe's grooves!

Would surely be proud<br>
To eternally apply for, even die for.

Is exceedingly rough,<br>

Never pass up a chance to shut up,<br>

With an edited retort<br>
They'll wonder to what you are up!

Your psychic has planned out your weekend,<br>
Says not to go off of the deep end<br>
And buy things not needed<br>
His advice should be heeded<br>
So you won't be tempted to overspend!
<p>The cat in my hat is named "Bugsy,"<br>
She answers as well to "McFugsy,"<br>
When she's on the prowl<br>
All the other cats yowl<br>
Because "Bugsy" plays kissy and hugsy!
<p>Forgetting your troubles is doable,<br>
And paying the bills is eschewable,<br>
So don't lose your sleep<br>
Because some bleeping creep<br>
Tries to make your life ever un-screwable!
