<h3><a href=mailto:Bktep@aol.com>Bluebird</a> writes 07/31/98</h3>
<h4>Costume Party</h4>
The Ku Klux Klan is the pits;<br>
A mob of low-class half-wits.<br>
They hide behind sheets<br>
Drinking beer, eating beets;<br>
I hope they get terminal zits.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/31/98</h3>
The phrase "name will be mud" was no dud<br>
Until history buffs chewed the cud<br>
And "name's Mudd" came in vogue ...<br>
But if Mudd was no rogue<br>
Then Mudd's name, although Mudd, wasn't mud!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Read all about the Mudd controversy at http://civilwarreader.com/thomas/mudd.htm"</i>

Tom Brokaw and Jennings and Rather<br>
'Board ship were just fated to gather.<br>
The played Anchors Away<br>
When they fell in the bay,<br>
Thank God we're all done with their blather.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>Friar</a> writes 07/30/98</h3>
In three years from today - I'll be thin!<br>
(The last four years - quite fat I have b'n)<br>
Cause I read: Every seven,<br>
(Not ten or eleven)<br>
I get a brand-spanking new skin!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "That will be my sixth new skin. Guess how young I am today.
"</i>
<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis </a> writes 07/28/98</h3>
In Cuba, their leader is nuts<br>
Fidel, I would say, is a putz.<br>
He could have played ball<br>
As he had wherewithal,<br>
But he never survived all the cuts.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/28/98</h3>

Once a rooster, who's such a night owl<br>
Was so tired of his job, he would scowl ...<br>
Now he crows before bed<br>
At a distant cliff head<br>
And the echo at dawn wakes his fowl!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "(a few more suggestions for first lines:<br>
A curious mammal's the beaver<br>
A goldfish whom circling frustrated<br>
A nubile young Finn who went skiing<br>
A privileged client's attorney<br>
"Hey, waiter, my soup's got a fly in!"<br>
Said a dentist, "Ma'am, please open wide<br>
While swimming across the Zambezi)"</i>
<p>
<i>For a poet who posts exclusively in the Squeaky section, you came up with some good 
naughty lines!</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/27/98</h3>
The Clintons both live with elation<br>
While the public is kept under sedation,<br>
By the media which tries<br>
With its incessant lies<br>
To keep them from incarceration.
<p>
Some friends had asked me to meet 'em<br>
At our great local arboretum.<br>
But on the date they appointed<br>
They were sore disappointed, <br>
Because I never got there to greet 'em.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/26/98</h3>
If you don't steep your tea very long<br>
Too much caffeine can do your heart wrong<br>
But should tannin leach out<br>
It will kill caffeine's clout ...<br>
Moral: Like tea a lot? &#151 drink it strong!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "(tried to send this a couple of weeks ago, but it never made it)"</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Now the Friar, whose given us ten<br>
Of the darnedest first lines has asked, "When<br>
Now that your turn is due<br>
Will we get some from you?" ...<br>
You? Who? Me? You mean me? ... OK then...
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "An anonymous poet online;<br>
An eagle whose wings had been clipped;<br>
A philosopher, finding a stone;<br>
If Shakespeare were writing today;<br>
Mathematics -- of sciences, queen;<br>
Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr;<br>
Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet;<br>
Said Delilah to Samson, "Your hair;<br>
The whole trouble with airlines is planes;<br>
Twenty thousand leagues under the sea"</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point becomes gleeful and promises to add the new 1st lines this weekend.  Thank you, perfesser!</i>
<p>
As the dog days of August approach<br>
Summer heat can afflict man or roach ...<br>
But one I saw today<br>
Scavenged coolly away<br>
In a sleek, air-conditioned roach coach!
<hr>
<h3>Marty writes 07/26/98</h3>
A nearsighted cleric from Queens<br>
Tossed their "toy" right back to some teens.<br>
It was a homemade<br>
Pipe bomb or grenade.<br>
It blew 'em all to smithereens!
<p>
"My Heart Will Go On" - Well, on what?<br>
A tray when my chest is cross cut.<br>
Docs may come and get<br>
Every useful bit<br>
There's an organ donor card in my wallet.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
I always leave carrots 'til last<br>
I'm a carrot enthusiast.<br>
I wait to savor<br>
Their piquant flavor<br>
At the end of every repast.
<p>The best part is right in the middle<br>
Hold the cup there when you piddle.<br>
Doc wants a sample.<br>
Make sure it's ample<br>
So he can solve your disease riddle.
<p>She screamed as he opened the door<br>
"If you dare invite just one more<br>
Darn boss to dinner<br>
We'll all be thinner<br>
We can't feed 'em -- we are too poor!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:KAZ1K@aol.com>Raceway</a> writes 07/26/98</h3>
A cannibal chef from Botswana<br>
Said "Oh, it would be sheer Nirvana<br>
          If only I could,<br>
         In full babyhood,<br>
Saute an hors d'oeuvre from Montana.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>Friar</a> writes 07/25/98</h3>
Beggars can always be choosers<br>
Insomniacs - very good snoozers<br>
The lamb wasn’t Mary’s<br>
The Springboks are fairies<br>
And the All Blacks are very good losers!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Well done guys, sorry Kiwis. Maybe CNN will show some footage (for a change)"</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/24/98</h3>
There once was a writer named Squeaky<br>
Who wrote with a pen that was leaky.<br>
He wrote many a verse<br>
But they kept getting worse,<br>
And in the end he got very sneaky.
<hr>
<h3>Bic Willis writes 07/22/98</h3>
If there's one thing that people dislike...<br>
Never call them a fag or a dyke.<br>
Plus, the "N" word's taboo,<br>
And when you see a Jew,<br>
For heaven's sake, never say "kike."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sage, welcome back.  Our poems are bulging."</i>
<hr>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
My cat likes to stand in the doorway<br>
She must have it "mine" and not "your" way<br>
Once let in she'll complain<br>
That she wants out again<br>
I think I'll put her on a plane to Norway.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Natasha says hello to <a href=../../gifs/leopold.jpg>Leopold</a>...<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>Friar</a> writes 07/22/98</h3>
I decided to try and phone Marty<br>
A nice message (I think a real smartie)<br>
But I heard background noise<br>
Was it rattles and toys?<br>
Or were you just throwing a party?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Our answering machine limerick follows. 
I wrote it a few years back. My wife and I sing it as a duet. Pity I can't send the score. 
Hope you enjoy."</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
We are probably out for a spin<br>
Or a vodka or tonic & gin<br>
If you would be so kind<br>
Leave your details behind<br>
And we’ll call you as soon as we’re in.
<p>Mini hiatus then maxi<br>
Of late inspiration’s been waxy<br>
So please ‘fore you go<br>
Leave us ten lines or so<br>
And then you may both catch your taxi.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wouldn't mind submitting more opening lines, 
but I challenge other readers to send some to TP (to get us through August). 
Prof M-G, FCA, Al W?
Enjoy your Hiatus guys. Still the best page on the web!"</i>
<p>
<i>Thank you!  Maybe I'll think up some new ones while in Houston this week (on business.  Texas in July.  Oh joy.)</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/21/98</h3>
Why's the star-spangled banner so beat?<br>
The curators blame dust, light and heat ...<br>
But I think the wool cloth<br>
Hides a star-spangled moth<br>
Eating all thousand twenty square feet!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "34 by 30, says our local newspaper"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/19/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
The illustrious Lighthill, Sir Jim<br>
Pioneered math for how creatures swim<br>
Which he used to swim round<br>
Sark &#151 but, sadly, he drowned<br>
From this circum-natational whim.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sir James Lighthill was applying his own theory to a swim around the 
Channel Island of Sark last Friday when he didn't quite make it 
(all in July 20 London Times obit)"</i>

<h3>Lady North writes 07/18/98</h3>
I'm not superstitious, but then...<br>
I walked under a ladder at ten<br>
It felt oh so neat<br>
So cool and so sweet<br>
And Mum says I should do it again!
<hr>
<h3>Marty writes 07/18/98</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Won't buy anything, I'm too cheap.<br>
Besides, I am prob'ly asleep<br>
Name 'n' number you say<br>
But don't take all day<br>
Leave your message after the beep.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I use this on my answering machine.  My mom left me a rhyming message!"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/18/98</h3>
I bought me a big SUV<br>
In spite of Gore's poignant plea.<br>
Al's found the solution<br>
To global polution,<br>
But it's only for him, not for me.
<p>
There was an old fellow named Bill<br>
Who kept putting his hands in the till<br>
He got pretty frisky<br>
While pouring whisky<br>
So now he owns his own still.
<p>
Bill wallowed in old Foggy Bottom<br>
With a gal named Hillary Rodham.<br>
But Ken the attorney,<br>
Cut short their journey,<br>
When he said, "By George, we got 'em."
<hr>
<h3>Al Willis writes 7/16</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
An amateur writer, named Reese,<br>
Composed an original piece.<br>
   "Hailstones from above<br>
    Reminded me of<br>
When maggots are fried in hot grease."

When Tarzan did summon<br>
I would come runnin'<br>
But I never knew what the fella meant."

<i>The poet comments, "Salute - Edgar Rice Burroughs!"</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/16/98</h3>
Names were mud &#151 as in dirt &#151 never "Mudd" <br>
Till some history buffs chewed the cud ...<br>
But if judges decree<br>
That Mudd's name be set free<br>
Won't "name's Mudd" once again be a dud?
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "In which case, the historically retarded will have the last laugh"</i>

<hr>
<h3>Frank writes 7/15</h3>
The unruly class all fell mute<br>
While meeting the new substitute,<br>
   Except I was bold<br>
   When I stood and told<br>
The class that I thought she was cute.
<p>
Quite quickly, my ear she had caught.<br>
No matter how hard I had fought,<br>
   She pulled me from the room<br>
   (But all wasn't gloom)<br>
'Twas sex education she taught.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/13/98</h3>
There once was a fellow named Smitty<br>
Who went to a Middle East city<br>
He rode on a camel<br>
A most lumpy mammal<br>
Designed by a Congressional Committee.
<p>
There once was a British Au Pair<br>
Who threw a young child down the stair.<br>
When the case went to trial<br>
She thouhgt it was vile<br>
Or at least it was not very fair.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Marty writes 07/12/98</h3>
I personally think Jeremy Brett<br>
The very best Sherlock Holmes yet.<br>
I'm sad that he's gone<br>
I wanted to prolong<br>
Those offerings from the PBS set.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip.net>Popsicle</a> shares a classic 07/12/98</h3>
There was a young hunter named Shephard<br>
Who was eaten for lunch by a leopard.<br>
Said the leopard,"Egad!<br>
You'd be tastier, lad,<br>
If you'd been salted and peppered."
<hr>

If velcro were used for a zipper,<br>
And Baptists believed in Yom Kippur,<br>
And all of the time<br>
We all spoke in rhyme,<br>
The world would be way much more hipper.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Singing everything would also work, BTW."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Marty shares a classic 07/09/98</h3>
I wish that my room had a floor<br>
I don't care so much for a door<br>
But this walking around<br>
Without touching the ground<br>
Is getting to be quite a bore!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is an Ogden Nash classic.  But, isn't everything he wrote classic -- and classy?"</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point loves Ogden Nash</i>.

<h3>Gearhart writes 07/09/98</h3>
There once was a philatelist whose<br>
Collection at first grew and grew<br>
He tried to sell them<br>
That's when they told him<br>
"They're not worth anything used!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "A philatelist is a stamp collector."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Bic Willis</a> writes 07/07/98</h3>
He's one of the crazy dictators.<br>
He's as smart as two witless dumb-waiters.<br>
Saddam, the barn burner,<br>
Is just a slow learner,<br>
And now his land has some new craters.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This dates from 1991."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:pabzum@ibm.net>Pablo Zum</a> writes 07/04/98</h3>
There once was a team from Brazil<br>
Who kicked at the ball with great skill.<br>
They once met the Danes<br>
Who'd oiled their vanes<br>
And made the guys go through the mill.
<P>
The match had five goals in the score,<br>
Though rooters were asking for more.<br>
Brazil was to win<br>
And save their dear skin<br>
At least till the next match in store.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:home4summer@yahoo.com>Amanda Henard</a> writes 07/05/98</h3>
There once was a witch who would fly <br>
On a broom through a starry sky<br>
Then the broom handle broke<br>
And her black cat awoke<br>
Because there on the ground they did lie.
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Bic Willis</a> writes 07/05/98</h3>
On Saturday night, up on Mars,<br>
You can find a few very nice bars.<br>
Though they have lots of beer,<br>
They have no atmosphere,<br>
And the life is found in mason jars.
<hr>
<h3>Emma writes 07/03/98</h3>
There were two calamitous pickles<br>
That laid in the sauerkraut crinkles.<br>
Said one to the other:<br>
What shall I do, mother?<br>
Surely you, not the salt, give me wrinkles!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 07/03/98</h3>
Here in Florida, forest fires thrive<br>
There's no hope unless rains soon arrive<br>
But there is a bright spot:<br>
Seems the fires are too hot<br>
For the billboards on I-95!
<p>
<i>We at the Toast Point contest are thinking of you down in Florida.  Hope it rains soon!</i>

He tells me that it ovulates."<br>
Mrs. Malaprop froze.<br>
And then, I suppose,<br>
He'll tell me that it also lactates."

At lying Bill Clinton's quite deft<br>
Of honor he's completely bereft<br>
If he undergoes surgery<br>
To exise his perjury<br>
There just won't be anything left.

After losing to foe Argentina<br>
English soccer fans flood the cantina<br>
To regret martial lore ...<br>
For who wins playing war<br>
Has to lose in the sporting arena!

<h3><a href=mailto:ppyppscl@snip,net>Popsicle</a> writes 07/01/98</h3>
I remember back when I was single.<br>
With all the girls then, I could mingle<br>
Those days were sure fun<br>
But, alas, they are done.<br>
Now all that I get is a tingle.

Used his dipstick to prop up the hood<br>
While he fixed an old wreck ...<br>
Then he did an oil check ...<br>
Now his head hurts far more than it should!
