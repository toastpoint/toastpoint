"Wanna blow job?" she elided<br>
As into her mouth she guided<br>
The tumescent tool<br>
Of the horny first fool<br>
And on into history they glided!

Said Bill to the intern, "Smoke some<br>
Of my se-gar - I don't want to - Come<br>
Back Kid! Or a stain<br>
On your dress could explain<br>
To Ken Starr that you chew more than gum!"

<h3>Anonymous shares a classic 09/29/98</h3>
There was a young priest from Paree<br>
Who went into the garden to pee.<br>
Said he, "Pax Vobiscum!<br>
I can't make my piss come.<br>
It must be the C -L-A-P!"

<h3>Jeeves writes 09/29/98</h3>
A scraggly old bag named Louise<br>
Had a pussy encrusted with cheese<br>
Her residual piss<br>
Made limburger and swiss<br>
And she'd give you some if you said "please"!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "You have raised the standards for a "star"
considerably..."</i>
<p>
<i>Is that a good thing or bad?</i>

An old Texas preacher called Zeke<br>
At length taught his asshole to speak!<br>
Oft' times it was liable<br>
To quote from the bible,<br>
But chili would make the thing shriek!

He warned her, "It might leave a scar<br>
If you let it burn down too far<br>
It may burn your clit<br>
If you leave that thing lit<br>
That's no way to smoke a cigar!"

<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="gold star!" align="right">
She smoked a cigar like no male<br>
But I have a mind for detail<br>
I asked without guile<br>
As I gave her a smile<br>
"You smoked, but did you inhale?'

<p>In the grand White House ediface<br>
There's a scandal to rival Oedipus<br>
In a most chancy game<br>
Our own Billy came<br>
In Monica's oval orifice!

<h3>Darren Kirby shares a classic 09/29/98</h3>

A curious mammal's the beaver<br>
Known often to give men the fever<br>
A taste to be trying<br>
But there's no damn denying<br>
It looks to be split by a cleaver!
<p>
A goldfish whom circling frustrated<br>
Of suicide the fish contemplated,<br>
"I've travelled the seas...<br>
Just as free as you please<br>
Till caught by a hook nicely baited."

<i>The poet comments, "So it's not dirty.  I'll wash my mouth out with soap."</i>
<p>
A privileged client's attorney<br>
Embarked on a truth-seeking journey<br>
When the pres lost his dick<br>
To a blade nice and thick - <br>
He now carried his balls on a gurney!
<p>
An anonymous poet online<br>
Tied his dick to his hand with some twine<br>
When he typed a long word<br>
It tugged on his gourd<br>
And shortened the length of his spine.
<p>
If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
He'd throw his feathered quillpen away<br>
He'd write limericks online<br>
Of dubious rhyme<br>
'Bout Lewinski's future dental decay.

<p>
Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr<br>
Tried to take down the American tsar<br>
She swallowed his jizz<br>
He argued 'bout "is"<br>
And they made the first penis a star!

<i>The poet comments, "Starr with star sucks, but hey that's another trial."</i>
<p>
Said Delilah to Samson, "Your hair<br>
Scratches my toungue when I go down there."<br>
So she gave him a clip<br>
But the scissors did slip<br>
Power lost for the invent of Nair.

<p>
Miss Lewinsky, Miss Tripp and Ken Starr<br>
Took samples of Bill in a jar<br>
An easier job<br>
Then slobbing his knob<br>
Because she swallowed all evidence so far!

The First Lady sighed as she sat,<br>
"That Monica looks kind of fat.<br>
She's hornier than me<br>
Indubitably<br>
But then, so is ol' Socks the Cat."
<p>
There once was a man made of plastic<br>
Whose wife was both tranquil and spastic.<br>
"If this manic-depressive<br>
Wasn't sexually repressive<br>
I could turn myself into elastic."

<p>
"Why Monica, love your blue dress!<br>
But that stain is so hard to assess!"<br>
Said she, "'Twas immaculate,<br>
Till Handsome's ejaculate<br>
Dribbled on it, I must confess!"

A scraggly old fucker named Rick<br>
Had a sore on the end of his dick<br>
So great was its size<br>
That it chafed women's thighs<br>
And the pus that it leaked made 'em sick!

<p>
A strapping young lad (name of Pete)<br>
Had a cock that was measured in feet<br>
The width of its head<br>
Gave some women dread<br>
While others believed it quite neat!

Found all young women quite cherry<br>
He once got the chance<br>
To get down one's pants<br>
And found that a fist he could bury!

And nor was it "pluck."<br>

<h3>Andy Onymous writes 09/24/98</h3>

Duane was quite charmed with Picasso,<br>
A cubist who made him groan basso<br>
At rectangle slits,<br>
And roundest of tits,<br>
And several views of one asso.
<p>
A pustule in one old whore's crack<br>
('Twas sebum and cancer-jam packed)<br>
Was pinched by a turd,<br>
And spewed out a curd<br>
That blistered her kinky john's sac!
<p>
<i>Ewwww!</i>
<p>
<h4>and continues the Hiftlorss Saga</h4>
A warp-drive? I found one to borrow!<br>
No more of this space-docking sorrow!<br>
I’ve got extra seats,<br>
So pack up your teats!<br>
I’m headed to LorssWorld tomorrow!
<p>
I’ve heard of a sex number four<br>
With more freaky habits in store<br>
For spacemen like me<br>
To marvel and see.<br>
So hurry! I’m sealing the door!
<p>
There once was a Hiftlorss named Xit<br>
Who had a strange thing for the pit.<br>
(Not the cunt-charm,<br>
The one under arm.)<br>
This Xit was a pervert and twit.
<p>
Let’s now introduce the ‘Lorss Xint.<br>
(The fourth sex of Hiftlorss, a ‘gent’.)<br>
Although Xints are ‘male’,<br>
They cannot impale<br>
Unless they shore up with the splint.
<p>
Their fifty pricks, flaccid and loose,<br>
Are vestigal and without use.<br>
Considered great beauties,<br>
They love to make tooties<br>
From skin-glands that sound like a goose.
<p>
Unlike the Troggs, with their smell,<br>
The Xints only broadcast a knell.<br>
They rise with the moons,<br>
And ‘fart’ like bassoons,<br>
In chorus and rhythm, as well.
<p>
To Earthfolk they look quite a fright<br>
A-spin under moons with strange light.<br>
They dervishly dance<br>
(Don’t wear any pants)<br>
With cocks flapping free in the night.
<p>
Their skin-glands emit a sweet tune<br>
That wafts over desert and dune<br>
And softly does stun<br>
The sex two and one,<br>
Who dream of their last honeymoon.
<p>
Now, mostly Xints do this alone<br>
(‘Cause most ‘Lorsses like a stiff bone).<br>
But Xit was a peeker,<br>
Not much of a feeker,<br>
And fancied the pit of the drone.
<p>
He stalked the Xints into their lair<br>
And drooled at their fine armpit hair<br>
Which hung in soft locks.<br>
Ol’ Xits fifty cocks<br>
Were swollen, and dripping, and bare.
<p>
Humbly, he spoke to the crowd,<br>
And begged them to ‘fart’ really loud<br>
While he just would flit<br>
From pit to sweet pit,<br>
And take a quick whiff, if allowed.
<p>
They looked at Xit, kind of like sheep,<br>
And said softly, “Go back to sleep.<br>
We know we’re quite smashing,<br>
But some hopes need dashing.<br>
Our duty is only skin-beep.”
<p>

<h4>After discovering the Xint on LorssWorld, we proceeded to the Rim:</h4>

The alien Sporch (from the Rim,<br>
Where starlight is milky and dim),<br>
Have juices that glow,<br>
And jeez, can they flow!<br>
For afterglow, take a bright swim!
<p>
In cities with high stony dikes<br>
They raise up their yeast crops and tikes.<br>
The sewers are huge -<br>
But sex? A deluge.<br>
The law requires countryside hikes.
<p>
It’s so damn pitch-dark all the time<br>
Sporch search out their mates with a chime.<br>
But as they draw near<br>
A green glowing smear<br>
Lights up the paths taken, with slime.
<p>
Then as they proceed to caress,<br>
And special sex-buttons depress,<br>
Their phosphorus juice<br>
Bursts forth in a sluice!<br>
The landscape lights up with their mess!
<p>
Their organs have special by-passes<br>
Between the sweet parts and their asses.<br>
If not for these holes<br>
They’d blow out their poles<br>
And rupture the cunts of the lasses.
<p>
Usually, when they’re on the verge<br>
Of climax, the Sporch will submerge<br>
Themselves in a lake.<br>
(The pressure’s a brake<br>
Which lengthens the time of their surge.)
<p>
The pressure at one hundred feet<br>
Is found to be luscious and sweet.<br>
It’s pretty, you know.<br>
(A deep greenish glow,<br>
Diffuse in the depths. Really neat!)
<p>
Further, if flow they don’t stem,<br>
The outcome is quite often grim.<br>
The rushing cum-drain<br>
Can implode the brain<br>
And leave it unconscious and slim.
<p>
Now last year, in some shallow brook,<br>
Two Sporch College kids blew their gook.<br>
Their minds are now toast.<br>
Thus quoth the provost,<br>
“Rill waters stun deep!” What a schnook!

A horny young couple from Fleenor,<br>
Met a man with a sexy demeanor,<br>
The husband then said,<br>
"Join us back in our bed,<br>
'Cause I'd like to see you in-between her."

Her initials rhyme with DJ<br>
When she hears this limerick<br>
She'll think I'm a prick<br>
If I replace DJ with BJ.

When Monica, in tears, went to Betty<br>
Her wisdom helped keep the girl steady.<br>
"Bill's leak on this dress,<br>
I'll leak to the press!"<br>
"Just remember: Kopechne and Teddy."
<p>
When FOB tried and true Jordan<br>
Caught Bill with loose lips and no cordon<br>

<h3>Taylor McCulloch shares a classic 09/21/98</h3>
There was a young coed named Schlicter<br>
Who had a boyfriend named Victor, who licked her<br>
With an ardor unslaked<br>
'Til she quivered and quaked<br>
On a scale that surpassed that of Richter.
<hr>
<h3>Tim Thompson writes 09/21/98</h3>
We know 'cause of Monica-gate,<br>
That the girl likes to flirt and fellate, <br>
But despite all her charm,<br>
It's caused her great harm,<br>
And she may never get a real date.
<p>
Bill said that he wouldn't be squirtin',<br>
'Til of Monica he was more certain,<br>
But now the world knows,<br>
How he comes and he goes,<br>
And his presidency sure is hurtin'.
<p>
You made a big blunder there, Billy,<br>
Could not keep control of your willy,<br>
Because of your lust,<br>
We have lost all our trust,<br>
And you've made the office look silly.

<p>
Once was a leader named Bill,<br>
Who, always in search of a thrill,<br>
Said, "I'll find a young intern,<br>
Who won't mind a rugburn,<br>
'Cause Hillary gives me a chill."

<h3>Zorbo, Princess of Darkness writes 09/21/98</h3>
A randy young lad from Nantucket<br>
Had a cock so long he could suck it<br>
His dick was so thick<br>

That when he came, he filled a bucket.

<h3>Vince Brickhouse writes 9/21</h3>
An altoid, I've heard, sure enhances<br>

In a Monica-Bill groping match,<br>
He stuck a cigar in her snatch,<br>
That slight bit of friction<br>
Began her addiction - <br>
Now Monica's wearing the patch!
<p>
At a gathering on Clinton's behalf,<br>
They shared a quick hug and a laugh,<br>
Someone heard him say,<br>
"I like your beret,<br>
And I think I'd like you on my staff."

Once was a young intern named Mon,<br>
Who went to the White House to spawn,<br>
If given the chance,<br>
She'd have tugged down Bill's pants,<br>
And blown him right there on the lawn.

<p>In reports from attorney Ken Starr,<br>
There's a tale of a Clinton cigar,<br>
That the thing was inserted<br>
Sounds oddly perverted,<br>
But in Washington, just about par.

<p>Said Bill to the girl on her knees,<br>
"For an intern you know how to please.<br>
And I know that you're bummin'<br>
Cause I stop short of cummin',<br>
But let's say that we're shooting the breeze."

Put a cigar in a different place.<br>

Was very much taken aback,<br>
'Cause the Marquis de Sade<br>
