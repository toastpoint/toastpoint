As though from the pages are torn,<br>
The elephant's sweater is worn.<br>
She tastes so mean<br>
Like a cold trampoline,<br>
And nonsense limericks are born!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Maybe others would like to try nonsense limericks. 
Dr. Seuss would be proud."</i>
<p>
<i>Worth a shot - although I think they would get old fast...</i><hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:DSHAW10156>Waukesha Don</a> writes 01/29/98</h3>
It's such a strange dichotomy<br>
That there is such a lot of me<br>
I must confess<br>
That I should weigh less - <br>
'Cause I lost some weight with a lobotomy!
<p>
Self help books were loved by Tom Cage<br>
But his income was minimum wage<br>
When he ran out of fuel<br>
He wasn't a fool<br>
He made a fire and burned every page!

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 01/29/98</h3>
Discovery, they say, can't be taught.<br>
It's something that many have sought.<br>
And when everyone sees<br>
The same thing, if you please,<br>
It's thinking what no one has thought.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Sage, how can we print a page or two of this?"</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage's brow furrows.  "Browsers don't recognize separate pages, so if you print 
from yours, you'll get the whole month.  You could select the text you want, 
copy into the Windows 
clipboard, then dump it into Notepad, I guess... If you're a Mac user, the 
Sage's knowledge just ran out."</i>

<h3>Beelzebub writes 01/29/98</h3>
The power of Faith, it is said,<br>
Can sometimes bring life to the dead;<br>
And the ages have shown<br>
That it is not unknown<br>
For the converse to happen instead.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is dedicated to Jesus freaks everywhere, particularly those whose limericks don't scan."</i>
<p>
<i>Uh-oh, a holy war!</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 01/28/98</h3>
Now what of old Bill C, our friar?<br>
His mandate to rule may expire<br>
The axe could be swift<br>
If it cuts him adrift<br>
But at least he'll have cash to retire!
<p>
A new era now Toast Point he faces<br>
Toward middle-life crisis he races<br>
But he might find his waist<br>
(If its narrowly-encased)<br>
With his broad-mind - it might just swap places!
<p>
<i>Toast Point shakes his head - for he is quite gravitationally challenged right now.  And 
my, that corset hurts at the end of a day...</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 01/28/98</h3>
She's a wily young thing, there's no doubt,<br>
Says "The Creep" gave her plenty of clout<br>
As an intern, while hugging<br>
And later on bugging<br>
Conversations that made Hillary pout!
<p>
Well, Monica looks like she's finding<br>
It hard to be pristine and shining,<br>
She set out to snare<br>
Bill in his own lair<br>
And now all she's doing is whining!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "No manners, these "planners"!"</i>
<p>
Whenever I see Valentines<br>
I'm reminded that "hearts" are like wines,<br>
The redder the better,<br>
So don't you forget her<br>
And send her those sugar-sweet lines.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Getting ready for February 14th?"</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Your girlfriend is balking, and still you<br>
Pursue her, although it may kill you.<br>
Valentines might just whet her<br>
And maybe you'll get her<br>
To answer a "YES" to your "WILL YOU?"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Coming soon!  Valentines Day!"</i>

A waiter at a restaurant in Des Moines<br>
Was serving trimmings with pork from the loin<br>
"Do you want stuffing ?", he growled<br>
To a woman, who fouled<br>
Up his sex life by a kick in the groin!
<p>
A gay who was called Ivor Hyde<br>
Caught a bus and went for a ride.<br>
"Your fare", said the driver<br>
When he spotted young Ivor<br>
"You're not bad yourself", he replied!

<h3><a href=mailto:nsf@atl.hp.com>Limerick Man</a> writes 01/27/98</h3>
After five years of President Bill,<br>
A complete term he may not fulfill.<br>
Do you think he can handle<br>
The latest sex scandal?<br>
Well, perhaps, there's a fool on the Hill.

I argued, "An arc is a boat."<br>

And then she said, "Irv,<br>
An arc is a curve,<br>
And you are a dumb billygoat."

<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 01/26/98</h3>
When Gennifer rang Monica up<br>
She said, "So he told you to shut up?<br>
Well, take my advice,<br>
Don't even think twice,<br>
You just call the Grand Jury and 'fess up!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Poor old Bill"</i>

<i>Toast Point doesn't know WHAT to think anymore...</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:mmestert@mailer.fsu.edu>Professor M-G</a> writes 01/26/98</h3>
Despite zero tolerance campaigners<br>
True non-addicts are never abstainers<br>
They are those, who for kicks<br>
Now and then have a fix -<br>
Be they rhyme hashers or word cocainers!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "OK, OK, I know what you're thinking ... 
but I abstained for four weeks, right? 
Now let's see how truly non-addicted I am ..."</i>
<p>
<i>Have another free sample, Prof?  Heh-heh-heh....</i>

May quite soon be COMPLETELY vice-less!

My calculator is whining and whirring!<br>
I've doubled checked in case it is erring.<br>
Dividing a century by three<br>
Makes Toast Point , you see<br>
Thirty three point three, three recurring!

<i>The poet comments, "Many happy recurrings !"</i>
<p>
<i>Thank you!  For those of us less specific, it's 33 years and four months (and counting).</i>

Monica tells all to the press,<br>
What Bill did is still just a guess,<br>
But we'll all soon find out<br>
What the Prez is about<br>
To do to bail out of this mess!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Poor little Monica, yeah! "Girl most likely to get her name in lights"

"His sexual appetite must be voracious"<br>

"But his libidinous activities<br>
Are his personal proclivities -<br>
Its the equivocation that makes me vexatious!"

A centipede, shopping for clothes,<br>
Decided to buy some nice hose.<br>
She said, "These look nifty."<br>
"I'll take about fifty,<br>
And those, yes, and those, yes, and those!

<h3><a href=mailto:priestss@owl.csusm.edu>foo</a> writes 01/23/98</h3>
In order to keep these lines shareable<br>
We must clutch hold of all that is wearable<br>
We ruin our undies<br>
Only on Mond'ys<br>
To think I just said that, unbearable!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
In order to keep these lines chaste<br>
We must compose all our words without haste<br>
With allusions be crafty<br>
'Sides, without clothes it's drafty!<br>
And those fingers keep well interlaced!
<p>
It helps to apply some libations<br>
To disperse all those darned hesitations<br>
Yet we'll keep our legs crossed<br>
And our teeth all well flossed<br>
Lest we give in to crude cogitations!
<p>
I don't think I can think of another<br>
I'd be willing to share with my mother<br>
I'll compose all thoughts cleanly<br>
And arrange them pristinely<br>
Into pained verse of one kind or other.

<h4>Ode to Apu</h4>
Nahasapeemapetilon is an Indian prince<br>
Who sells Squishees and Turbo-dogs for 99 cents.<br>
His green-card reads in great detail:<br>
"Convenience Marketing Specialist - Retail"<br>
because, sadly, a Kwik-E-Mart is the only palace for his Eminence!
<hr>
<h3>Boxer writes 01/22/98</h3>
There once was a thief who tried to frame a clown<br>
It was an evil plot to bring Krusty down.<br>
He was caught by Bart<br>
Who proved to be quite smart<br>
And Sideshow Bob was mocked by the entire town!

<h3>Poet from Qushing writes 01/22/98</h3>
There once was a man named Tyler<br>

He explained to the cops<br>
That he just needed a pop<br>
And that's why in his hands, he held pliers!

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 01/22/98</h3>

I got no reply<br>
'Coz my brainier side had gone out!

I drop in my dollar<br>
And,yell, no, I holler,<br>

When Lassie came home I was happy, <br>
And so was my mammy and pappy,<br>
But she took off again<br>
To that stud down the lane<br>
Who barked, "C'mon, Lass, make it snappy!"

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 01/21/98</h3>
If a schizo, by day, only boozes,<br>
Only gambles at night ('till he loses)<br>
And then flipped his mind<br>
Would he not be inclined<br>
To do just which-ever 'eschewses?

<h3><a href=mailto:priestss@owl.csusm.edu>Cyberpriestess</a> writes 01/19/98</h3>
To love her he just was not able<br>
For he found her to be quite unstable<br>
Her faulty ingredient<br>
Made their parting expedient -<br>
Too bad girls don't come with a label!

<h3>Jesus Freak shares a classic 01/19/98</h3>
People say I'm a Jesus freak<br>
Others think I'm a geek<br>
I know He's real<br>
His love I can feel<br>
It is His will that I speak.

<h3>Bethesda shares a classic 01/19/98</h3>
On Saturday night, up on Mars..<br>
I got locked in a cage without any bars<br>
I pushed and squeezed but couldn't get out<br>
So I sat in a corner and decided to pout<br>
Finally, I escaped with a few little scars!

<h3><a href=mailto:hmyers@globalnet.co.uk>FCA</a> writes 01/19/98</h3>

Who'd been bumped on the head in the summer.<br>
He said "The concussion<br>
Was the sole repercussion<br>
But the lump sure was a dinghummer"!
<p>
A pianist called Myer Von Grummit<br>
Gave a recital at a world leaders summit.<br>

<h3> Blue Raspberry shares a classic 01/16/98</h3>
"Why me?!" The bride cried and wailed.<br>
At the wedding, her fiance bailed.<br>
Dad wanted to have fun,<br>
So he took his shotgun<br>
With a gun in his back, the guy's bladder failed!

That little town of Hickory, Arkansas will never be the same."</i>

Last night I went full comatose<br>
Through no fault of my own, I disclose<br>
I was dared to sniff coke<br>
Which I did for a joke<br>
But an ice-cube got stuck up my nose!

I thought that I'd marry a Brunette<br>

Was a psychic, it seems<br>
And left me... before we had met!

<h3><a href=mailto:nsf@atl.hp.com>Limerick Man</a> writes 01/15/98</h3>
As a purist, and author, I groaned.<br>
Use of puns is just barely condoned.<br>
But, intending to kill<br>
Ev'ry bird on a hill,<br>
You just can't leave with no tern unstoned.
<p>

<h3>Jesus Freak shares a classic 01/15/98</h3>
There once wa a big dog named Rollie<br>
She jumped up and down, she was quite jolly!<br>
Every day she scratched her fleas<br>
One day she talked--Oh geeze!<br>
She turned out to be my only sister Hollie!

<hr><h3>Blue Raspberry writes 01/15/98</h3>
Chew toys, paper, and things like that<br>
Seem to be a natural dog habitat.<br>
Fire hydrants are their obsession<br>
While master's shoe is their possession<br>
No wonder people would rather have a cat!

To a cute weather pro,<br>
And you shall inherit the wind."

<h3>Jean Chapeau writes 01/14/98</h3>
Let's see, Hinkley's insane but not Dahmer,<br>
Then what about Ted Una-bomber?<br>
It's true he's not anthropophagic,<br>
So legally following logic,<br>
He must be as mad as a hatter!

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar</a> writes 01/13/98</h3>
The Clintons have spent all the dough...<br>
On whom, and on what, I don't know<br>

Who's over the Hill<br>
And is looking for some(young(old))thing "to-go"!

<h3>Soulmate shares a classic 01/13/98</h3>

But you sure as hell can't make them think!

The Clintons have spent all the dough...<br>
Now an audit they must undergo.<br>
All their Whitewater sin mates<br>
Just might become inmates!<br>
And none will have wealth to bestow.
<p>
All this uproar 'bout cloning's perceived<br>
As reaction to tenets believed:<br>
Only nature should do<br>
Procreation by two.<br>
Variation is just ill-conceived.

No other kitten has flown that high!

<h3>Boxer writes 01/12/98</h3>
I was driving beside a levy<br>
In my custom-built '64 Chevy<br>
I pulled over to sleep,<br>
When I woke up to a beep<br>
And found I was attacked by a bevy.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "For you ignoramouses who don't 
know what a "bevy" is. . . look it up!!!!!!"</i>.

And I bust out a song<br>
Until I slipped and fell on my seat!

She trimmed it just once.<br>
Then ate it for lunch.<br>

I have a sin - Procrastination<br>
Brings me sorrow beyond explanation<br>
But I made a small pledge<br>
At this year's leading edge<br>
To repent on my mid-year vacation!

A vampire, who, sadly, wore braces<br>
To his sister cried, "Life has no basis<br>
When on an assignment<br>
I'm out of alignment<br>
With not just my teeth, cos I'm gay, sis."

My poetical writing is rare<br>
And I'm now in the throes of despair<br>
But now and again<br>
Like the rain down in Spain<br>
A limerick falls from the air!

How much do I have in the bank?<br>
My memory of this is now blank.<br>
I must now presume<br>
That it's up in my room.<br>
I'll shake it and judge by the clank!

She could eat pizza pie or cheese blintz,<br>
And today, she ate five of the quints.<br>
She swallowed a pig,<br>
Her mouth was quite big.<br>
And last week she ate a crown prince!

There once was a liquid in pens,<br>
But now all our writing depends<br>
On the click of a Bic<br>
And I am heartsick.<br>
The multitude just condescends.
