How should warnings be passively aired,<br>
Now it's March? ... "Let the Ides be bewared!" --<br>
Or "the Ides be beworn!"? <br>
You can see how I'm torn ...<br>
.. Oh, excuse me, should I have said teared?

On Key West and Margaritaville hikin'!

<p>
The Godiva box gave up the necklace,<br>
And Susan's the winner, tho feckless<br>
Was her winner's quote,<br>
"I'd never wear it," she wrote,<br>

In Lent, kids are always complaining:<br>
No candy on which to be training.<br>
Then an Easter choc spree<br>
Makes them sick -- which, to me<br>
Proves no good ever comes from abstaining!

An angry professor revealing<br>
The intensity of his feeling<br>
Rammed his foot through the floor<br>
And his fist through the door<br>
On his way to hitting the ceiling!<p>A young English teacher of note<br>
Wore a hole in his coat<br>
At the elbow, it seems,<br>
Grading poor English themes.<br>
How awful them kids must of wrote!
<p>I just met this tap-dancing plumber!<br>
And I've never met anyone dumber.<br>
While he worked, he would dance,<br>
Leaving open to chance<br>
That his work would turn out a bummer.

Basketball is an exciting sport<br>
Watching the players run across the court<br>
Dribbling and scoring<br>
Never does the game get boring<br>

Where Beelzebub went, we know not,<br>
His limericks were cool and red hot,<br>
Hasn't posted for days,<br>
So now maybe his craze<br>
Is fiction writing, sans title or plot!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Where is that little devil?"</i><p>
A sushi bar that delivers?<br>
Now, that thought gives me the shivers!<br>
Boiled Puffers and Blowfish,<br>
Sea Urchin's a nice dish,<br>
If you like fish that twitches and quivers!
<p>

<p>The wise one, our Sage, gave a star<br>

<h3>John F. Shminkinbaun writes 02/22/98</h3>
There was an old man named Hooper<br>
Who walked around in a drunken stupor.<br>

Who nailed him with a pie<br>
And exclaimed "isn't that super!"

The Anthrax is safe, so they say,<br>
The Feds send both the perps on their way.<br>

And let's add "MEDIA" to the fray!

<i>The poet comments, "A plot to boost the gasmask industry???"</i>
<p>
Triple axel, triple toe-loop, how thrilling!<br>
To see these jumps landed without spilling<br>

Nasa thinks, Rover's filling rock jars ...<br>
But a Martian golf school<br>
Has usurped the module<br>
To drive round hitting nine-under-pars!

The rest isn't nice<br>
And now he's part Oceanic!

Years ago while on leave in Lahore<br>
I met a ghost who was gay,  whilst ashore.<br>
When I said, "You're a poof"<br>
I thought he'd go through the roof -<br>
But he didn't - he went through the door!

Which means radioactive<br>
Remotely attractive<br>
Rays kidnapping earthlings from cars!

<i>The poet comments, "??? ... Nah! ...."</i>

<p>
On Saturday night, up on Mars..<br>
Lonely green swots recite their three Rs ...<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:patricky@viser.net>Patrick </a> writes 02/19/98</h3>
There once was a woman so pure<br>
That her fame in this decade is clear<br>
She was nearly a saint<br>
And once she did faint<br>
When she saw a canary manure.

There was a young lady named Rose<br>
Pursued by two different beaus<br>
She hated the cad,<br>
Fell in love with the lad<br>
But when Titanic went under, he froze.

A Red Indian chief with three brides<br>
When asked how he chooses, confides:<br>
"The squaw by my side<br>
On the hippopotamus hide<br>
Equals the squaws on the other two hides."

<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 02/17/98</h3>
Setting free something loved is a heartache<br>
Holding on would bring only more heartbreak.<br>
If it never comes back<br>
Then you've proven your tack<br>
Was correct for your sanity's sake.
<p>
Sinking slowly from sight, The Titanic<br>
Heaved a groan, and a few there did panic<br>
That they would be drawn<br>
Undersea with a yawn<br>
When the hull vanished in the Atlantic.
<p>
Now the "tricks of the trade" are for sale,<br>
And Penthouse has put up a bale<br>
Of cash for a centerfold<br>
In hopes to be oversold<br>
When the rag of all rags tells the tale.
<p>The whitest-of-white fur, so real,<br>
And the eyes, burning black with such zeal,<br>
This babe's plight is urgent<br>
So the call is resurgent<br>
To rescue the new baby seal.

<h3><a href=mailto:hmyers@globalnet.co.uk>FCA</a> writes 02/17/98</h3>
Does your wife always nag and complain?<br>
When she's out of her kitchen domain.<br>
The best thing to do<br>
Is not hide in the loo<br>
But shorten the length of her chain!

At speling, I also excell.<br>
I got my acumen<br>
From good ole Ed Newman,<br>
But I no from my pomes you can tell.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "English teachers may feel at home here."</i>
<p>The media thinks it's their role<br>
To inform and control and cajole.<br>
They're brilliant, although,<br>

<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 02/16/98</h3>
Some good friends of mine from L. A.<br>
Bought into a gold mine, they say.<br>
They expect a cash cow,<br>
But it looks as though now<br>
They really just bought a cliche.

Bedfellows make strange politicians,<br>
No exception are those old Patricians<br>
Who go 'round all haughty<br>
But, in fact, are so naughty<br>
They could easily be labeled "clinicians."

<i>The poet comments, "Sign of the times??"</i>
<p>
"Maybe next time," she said with a smile,<br>
Walking swiftly away.  His profile<br>
Was deflated and grim<br>
'Cause she rebuked him<br>
Once again, with a grin and some guile!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Ah, that water cooler!"</i>
<p>The oyster, from sand, made a pearl<br>
Of such beauty, would please any girl.<br>
Though 'twas only a grain,<br>
The sand gave him great pain,<br>
Caused the oyster to twist and to twirl!

And your sweet serenade ...<br>
But for kisses to trade<br>
You must first buy a diamond ring!"

From the File / Print menu,<br>
Just select one or two.<br>
Use Explorer - it's all just the rage!

Most modern art seems waste of paint<br>

I just met this tap-dancing plumber!<br>
Can't think of anything dumber!<br>
'Cept a dog in a dress,<br>
A burlap vest,<br>
Or a snowman who really likes summer!

<h3>Beelzebub writes 02/02/98</h3>
When I saw Patsy first from the cab,<br>
She appeared nothing other than drab;<br>
But the distance deceived,<br>
For I quickly perceived<br>
That close up she resembled a crab.

<h3>Beelzebub writes 02/01/98</h3>
Thanks to the effect, one assumes,<br>
Of the pressure of internal fumes,<br>
The corpse of Lord Crate,<br>
While lying in state,<br>
Exploded and spattered three rooms.

<h3><a href=mailto:ystap@aol.com>Ystap</a> writes 02/01/98</h3>
When Valentine's Day comes around,<br>
All the pent-up sentiments abound,<br>
They send flowers and cards<br>
With words from the Bards<br>
In hopes that true love can be found!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "2/14  A Red Letter Day!"</i>
<p>
Now, guys, send your girls hearts and flowers,<br>
And poetry too, meant for hours<br>
Of sentimental reading,<br>
But don't be misleading,<br>
'Cause us girls have those "see-through-you" powers!

<i>The poet comments, "2/14  Doth my mail bag runneth over? Nah..."</i>
