<h1>The Toast Point Limerick Contest<br>Brady Bunch Limericks from 1995</H1>
<h2>Here's the story...of a bunch named Brady...</h2>
That squeaky-clean family, the Bradys<br>
Were sent to us straight out of Hades<br>
Their suburban palace<br>
And housekeep named Alice<br>
All serve to make Toast Point a Fraidy!<p>

<h2>The Winners</h2>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=bottom>Jonathon G. writes 8/23</h3>
When Peter and Greg pick on Bobby,<br>
They beat him 'til his head turns knobby,<br>
Then bugger him raw-<br>
When he told Ma & Pa, <br>
They said "Well, ev'ry boy needs a hobby."

Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/12</h3>
While pressing her bell-bottomed jeans<br>
Marcia, she primps and she preens<br>
And Jan, with an Uzi<br>
And nary a 'Scuse me!'<br>
Plots Marcia's fate...smithereens.

Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/8</h3>
When Mike went out back with the boys<br>
To tell them they made too much noise<br>
He found Greg in drag - <br>
And inside his handbag<br>
Were stuffed the most curious toys
<hr>

Drayton INC writes 5/23</h3>
Now Alice sure thinks Sam is neat,<br>
She claims his cold cuts can't be beat,<br>
No one can bowl better<br>
She'd sure love to get her<br>
Hands on his large balls and his meat.
<hr>

Pthirus channels Jan, <br>
who we <b>all</b> know Tarazed likes better, anyhow 5/23</h3>
Bitch Marcia's out with Davey Jones<br>
I'm alone, no boy <b><i>ever</i></b> phones!<br>
She's <b><i>had</i></b> Desi Junior<br>
I'd sure like to ruin her<br>
Chance tonight to jump Monkee bones
<hr>

Anonymous writes 5/22</h3>
The Brady who wore that damned tiki<br>
Had to put up with things going freaky.<br>
It hung round his neck<br>
Darned the family to heck!<br>
And Greg's surfboard was certainly leaky.
<hr>
<h3><img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align=bottom>
Ariel Raccoon channels Jan Brady 5/20</h3>
My dumb sister Marcia's a bitch,<br>
And that brat sib Cindy's a snitch,<br>
Bob Peter and Greg,<br>
And Alice the nag,<br>
They all should be dead in a ditch!

<hr>
<h2>Honorable Mention:</h2>
<h3>Mr. Blackwell writes 6/2</h3>
Just pity our poor Mike and Carol -<br>
Their kids have them over a barrel!<br>
Those brats, filled with loathing<br>
Burned up their nice clothing<br>
And make them wear <b><i>tacky</b></i> apparel!
<hr>
<h3>Artie the Jungle Troll writes 6/8</h3>
Cindy's a lisping annoyance.<br>
Blond curls give me pains in the gro-ins.<br>
Would she sink like a stone<br>
If in water she's thrown?<br>
I'm wondering...what is her bouyance?
<p>
Marcia and Greg had a stand-off<br>
When he asked if she'd ever a man boff.<br>
When Greg gave a try<br>
To grope up her thigh<br>
She glared and said "Greg, get your hand off."
<hr>
<h3>Pthirus channels Jan 5/24</h3>
I hope that dad's job is okay,<br>
I heard, on my way out to play,<br>
He couldn't erect!<br>
He's an <em>architect!</em><br>
Poor dad, he'll get it up some day.
<hr>

<h3>Buckaroo writes 5/22</h3>
I wonder what Peter was doing<br>
With Marcia; she surely was cooing<br>
When he cried "Yeah, just thank me<br>
After you yank me!"<br>
All we heard after was mooing....
<hr>
<h3>Tarazed writes 5/22</h3>
The scamp who stole Jan's private journal<br>
Had something in mind most infernal!<br>
She sobbed "My oh my!"<br>
And she left it to dry<br>
When she fished it up out of the urinal.
<hr>
<h3>Tarazed channels the much prettier Marcia Brady 5/22</h3>
My little sis Jan is a nag<br>
Consistently she's on the rag!<br>
With those glasses and braces<br>
We all know her face is<br>
Better concealed by a bag.
