<h1>The Toast Point Limerick Contest<br>
Brady Bunch Limericks</H1>
<h2>Here's the story...of a bunch named Brady...</h2>
That squeaky-clean family, the Bradys<br>
Were sent to us straight out of Hades<br>
Their suburban palace<br>
And housekeep named Alice<br>
All serve to make Toast Point a Fraidy!<p>
<hr>
<h2>1998 Entries</h2>

<h3>Canadian Joe writes 12/22/98</h3>
On the surface the Bradys seemed placid,<br>
From a lobotomy point of view, quite candid,<br>
Though agent "Smart" had a shoe phone,<br>
And the castaways a new home,<br>
It's obvious the Bradys were on acid!
<p>
The Brady X-Mas was known as the best,<br>
Everyone behaving, even Bobby the pest,<br>
When the paper was ripped,<br>
They all then stripped,<br>
Turning Brady X-Mas to a carnal fuck fest!

<h3><a href=mailto:fishie_pie@hotmail.com>Philip Welsh</a> writes 12/04/98</h3>
Sam and Alice had a sadistic hobby<br>
Which they ultimately worked on Bobby:<br>
Thus the poor lad was sold<br>
For eight ounces of gold<br>
To a sheik's harem in Abu Dhabi.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Too bad they didn't get Mike that way."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:fishie_pie@hotmail.com>Philip Welsh</a> writes 12/02/98</h3>
The time Jan, Sam and Mike had a threesome<br>
Caused the others to merc'lessly tease 'em --<br>
Caught i.f.d.* by Carol<br>
Who'd hid in a barrel<br>
On the off-chance she somehow might see some.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "* i.f.d. = in flagrante delicto"</i>
<hr>
<h3>WebCat writes 11/25/98</h3>
Is Carol's hair really that flip?<br>
As stiff as her leather whip,<br>
Which she knew how to use,<br>
When Mike begged for abuse<br>
And they'd do the whole S&M trip!<br>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Viva La Brady bunch!"</i>
<hr>
<h3>WebCat writes 11/21/98</h3>
When Sam locked the kids in the freezer<br>
Was it from being a senile old geezer?<br>
Or 'cause Alice was there, <br>
And didn't want them to see<br>
His feeble attempts to please her...!<br>
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Remember,this was in the days before Viagra! "</i>

Sunday nights, when the kids are in bed,<br>
Carol finishes giving Mike head,<br>
And straps on a prosthesis --<br>
Mike cries, "Not again! Jesus...<br>
Can't you stick it to Alice instead?"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "...appropriated from a scene originally intended as a prequel to the gripping, 2-part "Grand Canyon"
episode, but unanimously rejected by all but one of the show's sponsors for being passive-aggressively sympathetic to the
Communist Menace. For additional spin-offs, see "You Must Remember This" in Robert Coover's utterly delightful <b>A Night At
the Movies</b>.

P.S. -- Who you callin' a lawyer?"</i>

<i>Well, billable hours...</i>

Marcia's thoughts will often deprave<br>
To moist visions of being Sam's slave,<br>
In which -- bound, wrists and ankles --<br>
She is corn-holed and spankled<br>
Any time that she fails to behave...

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is loosely adapted from Chapter 12 of The Marquis DeSade's novel Julianne."</i>
<hr>
<h3>Deep-Goat writes 10/25/98</h3>
When Greg's in Hawaii, "Surfs up!"<br>
Till he saw Marcia's triple C cup.<br>
He went back in the water<br>
For his loins had got hotter<br>
Because something had suddenly came up!

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Tudymae@aol.com>Tudymae</a> writes 10/20/98</h3>
Carol, whose hair flips straight up<br>
And Alice whose hair's like a mutt's<br>
Went walking the streets,<br>
Flashing their tits,<br>
Till the cop that they flashed picked them up.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Im sorry, I couldnt help my self."</i>

When Sam locked the kids in the freezer<br>
They said: "Let us out, cuz Greg's a weezer!"<br>
Sam simply replied <br>
(Hand on Alice's thigh):<br>
"Wait 10 minutes, cuz I've got to please her!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "10 SECONDS is probably more like it!"</i>
<p>
The kids' bathroom toilet is missing<br>
So in a jar they'll be pissin'<br>
Now there's nowhere<br>
For Greg and Marsha to share<br>
A QUICKIE when no one is listenin'!
<p>
Is Carol's hair really that flip?<br>
Does she use any rollers or clips?<br>
Does it ever get frizzy <br>
When she's in a hissy,<br>
Cuz her and Mike are bumpin' hips?
<p>
Greg Brady and coy Laurie Partridge<br>
Were listenin' to an 8-track cartridge,<br>
When she said:"Take me Greg!<br>
Please, don't make me beg!"<br>
He replied to her: "Shut up, and blow, BITCH!"

<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:hotrods@palacenet.net>Dustin Roddewig</a> writes 10/12/98</h3>
There once was a family named Brady<br>
The bunch was very degrading<br>
One day in the park<br>
They got ate by a shark<br>
But they were just faking.
<p>
<i>The Sage sternly admonishes the poet that rhymes need to be closer than that!</i>
<hr>
<h3>Tim Thompson writes 09/21/98</h3>
Said Carol to her step-son Greg,<br>
"Oh please, young stud, don't make me beg!<br>
Your father's a bore,<br>
He goes soft more and more,<br>
And I'm tired of him humping my leg."
<hr>

When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
For kicks and a couple of moans<br>
She laughed with delight<br>
When first she caught sight<br>
Of "Peter Tork" tattooed on his bone.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Peter was asking for it."</i>
<p>
The kids' bathroom toilet is missing<br>
'Cause the kids were to scared to be pissing<br>
With a permed faggot named Mike<br>
And a maid who's a dyke<br>
Tiger was wise to go missing!

<p>
Now Greg had some problems, I'm confessin'<br>
And Carol thought she'd teach him a lesson<br>
When he pulled out his shaft<br>
And shoved it in aft<br>
He make sure it was covered with Wesson!

<hr>
<h3>Bilzzz writes 07/05/98</h3>
While Alice made dinner that night<br>
Greg and Peter got into a fight <br>
Greg said, "Now wait - <br>
I'll handle this debate"<br>
And went and fucked Tiger outside!

Is Alice a bulldyke or what?<br>
Her attitude doesn't say "hot".<br>
But give Sam a chance,<br>
That bulge in his pants<br>
Is meat for dear Alice's twat!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:Puma_Girl@usa.net>Nikole  Burgandy</a> writes 05/21/98</h3>
When Marcia embraced Davy Jones<br>
Their pelvis' touched bone to bone.<br>
She screamed in delight<br>
As they fucked left and right<br>
Now Marsha sports Madonna cones!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "send me money please. no, im serious. my brother nikki 
was born without intestines and its a hell of a lot of money to pay for treatment. Thanx. 
luv</i>

<h3>Isabel writes 04/01/98</h3>
There once was a family named Brady<br>
With Carol the wife, but no lady.<br>
Off the screen she would flirt,<br>
In a tight miniskirt,<br>
With Greg, her screen son, in the shade-y.

When Sam locked the KIDs in the FREEZER<br>
For Alice (he was trying to please her)<br>
Cried Alice "Oh, dear,<br>
Sam, what did you hear?<br>
I want your meat HID in my SQUEEZER!"<hr>
