A man both disgusting and crass<br>
Poked a long rubber hose up his ass<br>
It wasn't the shit<br>
That caused him to quit<br>
He was jailed for siphoning gas!

<p>A guy  of fastidious mind <br>
Envied cats who could lick their behind<br>
While stretching his tongue<br>
To lick his own bung<br>
He became stoop-shouldered and blind!

<p><i>The poet comments, "I have been accused of a sickness that is uncurable."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:kbrews@galstar.com>Dionysos</a> writes 02/21/99</h3>
The night before the big show,<br>
Eugene shopped for a quick blow;<br>
No, he didn't refrain,<br>
From cruisin' Biscayne,<br>
Now known as tough road to ho'.
<p>
"Hey, waitress, my soup's go a fly in!,<br>
I don't know what sport you are tryin';<br>
If you're anglin' my eel,<br>
Then take up your reel,<br>
And I'll show you some tricks about tiein'".

Sweet Monica thought it no sin<br>
To chug a whole fifth of gin<br>
Which explains cum-stained dresses<br>
Her dishevelled tresses<br>
And that mess dripping off of her chin!

<p>

<h3>Mark from Dublin writes 02/18/99</h3>
He wanted to be a sex stud<br>
And greatly enlarge his manhood<br>
But it all went so wrong<br>
And he lost half his schlong<br>
Cos his DOCTOR was called 'HOLLYWOOD'

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Typically Topical"</i>
<p>
The whole trouble with airlines is planes<br>
And I am always at pains<br>
To point out the fact<br>
That the things they lacked<br>
Were blood and balls and BRAINS!

<h3>Bobo (Hi Coco!) writes 02/15/99</h3>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
There once was a buck from Gilbraltar<br>
Who left a young lass at the altar;<br>
Some say he went queer,<br>
Others say ‘twas the beer,<br>
And the buggers and drunks, they all fault her!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I dedicate this unworthy doggerel to my visionary poet-friend Coco.
Why, I ask you, are the good ones always taken? "</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:drjin@aol.com>Mikey</a> writes 02/13/99</h3>
There was an old man in the City<br>
Who tried making love to his kitty<br>
The poor cat revolted<br>
Out the back door she bolted<br>
And now he's alone, what a pity!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:>Remkle McSabbivy</a> writes 02/11/99</h3>
There once was a man caught off guard,<br>
When he for-got his Valentine's card,<br>
But his gal had the laugh,<br>
When she noticed his staff,<br>
And told him that things could stay hard.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Experience is an awful teacher..."</i>
<p>The moral of this tale is true,<br>
And not such a hard thing to do,<br>
To avoid such laughter,<br>
Just wait until after,<br>
Then break the bad news when you're through!


<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Live and learn..."</i>

<h3>Bubba writes 02/10/99</h3>
There was a young lady from France<br>
Who took a train by chance<br>
First, the engineer fucked her<br>
Then the conductor<br>
While the fireman shot off in his pants!
<hr>
<h3>H writes 2/10</h3>
Misfortune, this new central air -<br>
It gave all my guests a good scare.<br>
My farts were all trapped -<br>
Their t-cells got zapped.<br>
‘Twas mightier than Legionnaire.
<p>
The only cure that I could think of<br>
Was burning that poisonous stink off.<br>
But when I went thence<br>
To light some in-cense,<br>
The fire brought to death us the brink of.
<p>
A baker who made kidney tarts<br>
Would eat ‘em with fish sauce and warts.<br>
The stray cats would beg<br>
And sniff at his leg<br>
And drool at the smell of his farts.
<p>
Last night in the club we had bells on,<br>
When all of the patrons, they smelled one.<br>
They’re sniffin’ and whiffin’ -<br>
The axe-man was riffin’ -<br>
But *I* stole the show with a swell one.
<p>
I had me some chili last night<br>
With limas and corn - a delight.<br>
Them SBD fumes<br>
Could clear 50 rooms.<br>
Thank god I began to ignite.
<p>
<img src="../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A hurricane’s formed to the lee!<br>
Mate! Radio lubbers to flee!<br>
The tide will soon surge!<br>
God damn this foul urge!
I shouldn’t be farting at sea...
<p>
I held back my shit for a week<br>
Then cut me a slathering freak.<br>
That glorious flatus;<br>
That cheesy mutatus!<br>
The neighbors now frown and don’t speak.
<p>

H gave her cunt a good scrape<br>
Then set about "lubing" his snake<br>
But as he rubbed in the oil<br>
His balls started to boil<br>
Eighty bucks for a wank, for fucks' sake!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Top what, years of practice and you still can't get a gold star !"</i>
<p>
<i>Um, maybe it's because of not-rhymes like "scrape" and "snake"?</i>

If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
I think that by chance he would say<br>
Hey, Dugan, you fool,<br>
You look like a tool<br>
Staring at that computer all day!
<P>
In walked my mother one day - <br>
She saw me and started to say,  <br>

Then she turned to run<br>
Because I'd just started to spray!

<i>The poet comments, "masturbation-ah yes... masturbation"</i>
<p>An anonymous poet online<br>
Was trying to find a good rhyme<br>
Came upon a web site <br>
Of girls who are tight<br>
And blew off his work for a shine.

<p>If Shakespeare were writing today<br>
I think that by chance he would say<br>
Hey, Dugan, I think <br>
That all blow jobs stink<br>
Unless they're received right away.

<p>
<i>Is there such a thing as a delayed-action blowjob?</i>

"Sixty nine was a bit of a flop,"<br>
Said the girl as she moved back on top.<br>

I met her one night on the strand<br>
Where she'd frolicked all day in the sand.<br>

<p>

<h4>from Stargazer</h4>
About Tyson I don't need to rant any.<br>

<p>

Two fairies were flitting one day<br>
In the meadow where they liked to play.<br>

<p>


<h4>from John Miller</h4>

Said the buyer, "I understand well,<br>
We'll leave you this one little dell."<br>

<p>


<h4>from Jeeves</h4>
It is said, or so I have heard,<br>
That a woman is like a dog turd.<br>

<p>


<h4>from John Chastaine</h4>
Here's a question designed to perplex,<br>
About turtles about to have sex.<br>

To get the right hole, which one checks.                    
<p>

A recessive gene pair<br>
In which both parents share,<br>
Severely impaired your mobility."

<h4>from Norm Storer</h4>
I know a frenetic young Mexican,<br>
Who daily seeks all of the sex he can;<br>
After some years<br>
His life will shift gears,<br>
And never be quite so complex again.                        
<p>


<h4>from Thomas M. Patton</h4>
A young man so brainy, named Dwight,<br>
Wed the Siamese twin on the right.<br>
To satisfy his whims,<br>
He had choice of quims.<br>
They had a manage a trois every night.                      
<p>


<h4>from Al Willis</h4>
I'll say a kind word about marriage.<br>
It's something I'd never disparage.<br>
You get lots of sex,<br>
But it has some effects.<br>
I just bought my third baby carriage.
