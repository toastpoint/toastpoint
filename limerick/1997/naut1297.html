<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> shares a classic 12/31/97</h3>
There was a young lady of Louth<br>
Who returned from a trip to the South.<br>
Her father said, "Nelly,<br>
There's more in your belly<br>
Than ever went in by your mouth."

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "From The Lure of the Limerick; those writers were great."</i>

While cuddled up under the duvet<br>
Olga murmurred "Hmm, this is groovay<br>
That limerick with a blanket<br>
Meant that I could only vank it<br>
But there's no restriction with a duvet for this new vay"!
<p>
This wee bonnie Irish young lass<br>
Fell asleep in the meadow, after Mass<br>
She woke up and discovered<br>
She was naked but covered<br>
By a very heavy jew on the grass!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I have no wish to be flogged so did not post 
this in Squeaky Clean. There is a classic I vaguely remember with 
a similar storyline."</i>

Dolly Parton is built, I declare,<br>
And she has a quite marvelous pair.<br>
I would give a month's pay<br>
For a saucy display<br>
Or a C-note to see her what'er.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I hope this is the first time I submitted this one."</i>

<h3>Jennifer writes 12/29/97</h3>
Fair Julia, who sold Christmas candy<br>
Fucked Raggedy Anne & Andy<br>
She also sold sex toys<br>
To little girls & boys<br>
And made lots of dough, which was dandy!
<p>
There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
What's better than mechanical sex?<br>
I've searched hi & low<br>
Seems I've lost my dil-do!<br>
Now I'm in a horrible vex!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
There's a question designed to perplex.<br>
Why is a man's ego so complex?<br>
Is it the size of his dick<br>
That makes a man tick?<br>
Or maybe its just his genus - sex? 
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Men just can't help that they are men! Can't live with-em - can't live without-um!"</i>
<p>
It is said Mr. Gore is a bore.<br>
Who couldn't satisfy even a whore.<br>
Tipper's screwin around<br>
In that bad DC town<br>
Soon he'll be VP no more!
<p>
Now Hillary's known as a leader.<br>
Whose husband can't even please'r<br>
Rumor she's makin it with Tipper<br>
The Professor, Gilligan & Skipper.<br>
But I think she's just a cockteaser!
<p>
<i>The Sage warns the poet to stop submitting naughty entries on the squeaky-clean form, or risk a flogging.</i>

"I know just what I want for my present" !<br>
Said the wife in a rage, incandescent.<br>
"When I said 'something to pluck'<br>
What I meant , you big schmuck<br>
Was a harpsichord, not a damn pheasant" !
<p>
"I know just what I want for my present" !<br>
Said the wife in a rage, incandescent.<br>
"When I hinted 'distant and hot'<br>
I meant Hawaii, you clot<br>
Not a picture of the Sun from our crescent!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Do you have "Crescents" in the States ? In England they are residential street names eg. 54, Millbank Crescent............."</i>
<p>
<i>No, not really, but we sort of know what they are.</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:AABBABOB@AOL>Sam Pittman</a> writes 12/28/97</h3>
There was an old whore named McGuinn<br>
Who often drank far too much gin<br>
Which explains her soiled dresses<br>
Her dishevelled tresses<br>
And the cum dripping off of her chin!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
A prelate of very high station<br>
Was found by a pious relation<br>
On top, in a ditch<br>
Of, I won't say a bitch<br>
But a woman of low reputation!

<h3>Jennifer writes 12/26/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
This wee bonnie Irish young lass<br>
Had two cunts instead of an ass.<br>
Doggy style or supine,<br>
They both were divine...<br>
But menage a trois -- that was first class!

<hr>
<h3>Annie Mae Hentai writes 12/26/97</h3>
I hate them little virtual pets<br>
Act like mommy, daddy, and vets?<br>
Those things really suck--<br>
Can't make 'em fuck!<br>
Oh, how annoying it gets!!!
<hr><h3>Jennifer writes 12/26/97</h3>
While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
My boyfriend asked me to yank it.<br>
I really wanted to fuck<br>
Instead we settled on a suck<br>
He cummed and then I drank it!
<p>
You've been bad, old grouch Ebenezer!<br>
For he's fucked too many a skeezer<br>
Now he has a big rash<br>
On his fat hairy ass<br>
Yuck! What a nasty old geezer!<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:caithara@ihug.co.nz>CyberCelt</a> spent most of Christmas writing</h3>
"We gay boys can make Christmas merry!"<br>
Said a handsome young fag named Terry<br>
We spend Christmas day<br>
Being ever so gay<br>
With the sailors we met on a ferry !<p>
I know just what I want for my present!<br>
A penis enlarger, and crescent<br>
With no "if's" or "buts"<br>
I'd tighten my nuts<br>
And have a penis size BIGGER than pleasant!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I dont know about anywhere else in the world, 
but in New Zealand a "Cresent" is an adjustable spanner.
(just thought i should clear that up before everyone out there went "DOH?""</i>
<p>
<i>Toast Point, after fixing the spelling, realized that the poet is 
referring to what we Americans call a "crescent wrench".</i>
<p>
While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
With a girl who I know from Melankitt,<br>
I stripped off with ease<br>
And said "Darling, please...<br>
Would you mind awfully much if I wank it !

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Melankitt ? I know its a bit obscure, but you try and find a place name that rhymes with blanket !"</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
While visiting Santa's North Pole<br>
A sheep from his stable I stole,<br>
I was quickly erect<br>
But whats this I detect?<br>
The cold air had frozen its hole!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "CyberCelt manages yet again to bring sheep shagging into the spotlight!
(does anybody think i need professional help?)"</i><p>
<i>Toast Point didn't know Santa kept sheep, but wouldn't be surprised, with 
all those elves and things running around.</i>
<p>
<p>You've been bad, old grouch Ebenezer!<br>
Keeping your deceased wife in the freezer<br>
Through she's terribly rigid<br>
And incredibly frigid<br>
Frozen pussy, I hear, is a pleaser!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Said a girl with a lisp from Gore<br>
"My Vaginath incredibly thore<br>
There ith thomething amith<br>
When I take a pith - <br>
I dont think I'll have thex anymore!
<p>
Carol, my lovely bethrothed,<br>
A particular habit of mine loathed,<br>
I'm awake late at night<br>
And strange verse's I write<br>
But I sit at the 'puter unclothed !

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Hmmmm..makes you wonder where i get the inspiration for some of the filth that I write!"</i>
<p>
A Leper who came from La Tound<br>
Grabbed his penis and twisted it round<br>
"It looks like it's rooted"<br>
Je woefully muted<br>
As the knob dropped onto the ground!
<hr>
<h3>Jacques D'Monke writes 12/24/97</h3>
Fair Julia, who sold Christmas candy<br>
And all sorts off cookies with brandy<br>
Grabbed her crotch with her hand<br>
And said "Come here, big man"<br>
"I need a good lick 'cause I'm randy!"
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 12/24/97</h3>
In the palace, the princess, unclad,<br>
Had guests every day at her pad.<br>
They were very discrete<br>
Beneath the bedsheet - <br>
The kids don't resemble their dad!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:siredward@webtv.net>Prince Eaglehead</a> writes 12/23/97</h3>
I know just what I want for my present!<br>
It's to watch Santa Claus fuck a pheasant!<br>
Then cook it for lunch<br>
And I have a hunch<br>
That the stuffing would taste sort of pleasant!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Pick a just dessert!"</i>
<p>
There's a nip in the air, love, tonight.<br>
But that bulge in my crotch feels just right<br>
You won't feel the cold<br>
If you grab a good hold<br>
And we'll fuck till the dawn's early light!<hr>
<h3>The Scarlet Pumpernickel writes 12/23/97</h3>
There once was a young seductress named Sonja<br>
To whom a dashing scientist said," I'd like to clone ya."<br>
That change our lass did resist<br>
But gave in after being kissed<br>
And being asked  "Well what if I just go ahead and bone ya?" 
<hr>
<h3>Violet writes 12/23/97</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Said a wee bonnie young Irish lass<br>
With a Xmas tree lodged in her ass<br>
"I don't really mind me<br>
Having pine in my heinie<br>
But this tinsel is giving me gas!"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "merry merry xmas and happy new year, all."</i>
<p>
<i>The Sage just had to get his nasty little fingers into that one - 
apologies to the poet.</i>
<p>
One of Santa Claus' elves (name McGoo)<br>
Asked one day of his boss, "Is it true?<br>
That Ms. Claus is a fox<br>
With a tight little box<br>
Who, when coming, lets out a great "MOO!"?"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "FA-LA-LA-LA-LA"</i>

We gay boys can make Christmas merry!<br>
He's Joe, that's Doc and I'm Terry<br>
I don't really mock<br>
When Joe puts his vessel in Doc<br>
But I can't resist calling him "ferry"!
<p>
While visiting the city of Cologne<br>
I had a drink at the BunnyClub, alone<br>
"What's yours ?" , smiled a bunny<br>
"I'd love two liqueurs, honey"<br>
She sniffed and said "Go lick your own"!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "It's quite amazing how these poems come about - 
this one started from some early thoughts on '-nope, wanna use my own' "</i>

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
With donors of sperm, you can rank it -<br>
A much easier task<br>
Than in labs, with a flask ... <br>
However, it's harder to bank it!

I know just what I want for my present!<br>
Though I did ask you to buy me a feasant<br>
But, what the fuck<br>
Better get me a duck<br>
Since you said there was no effin'  feasant !
<p>
That Rudolph and Yukon Cornelius!<br>
Say "We're unsure the gay life's ideally us.<br>
We could choose, it appears<br>
To pick up some 'dears'<br>
Or go to that stag party at Amelia's!"<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 12/22/97</h3>
The king must be off of his trolley.<br>
He gave up his throne for his Wally.<br>
She concealed her woo-woo,<br>
And her tits were just two.<br>
But she must have had SOMETHING, by golly!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Was he a king or a prince? Anybody remember?"</i>

<h3>Chilly-Willy writes 12/21/97</h3>
There's a question designed to perplex<br>
Santa asking a little kid for sex<br>
The little boy didn't know what to do<br>
Santa said he'd give him a screw<br>
Then the boy said, " You don't need carpentry for sex!!"
<hr>
<h3>Annie Mae Hentai writes 12/20/97</h3>
Ol' Jack Claus, who sold Christmas trees<br>
Could not a woman in this world even please<br>
And even if he could<br>
Who'd want a guy who sold wood?<br>
Even if his hard-ons could bring em to their knees!
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 12/20/97</h3>
The Brits still line up in a queue<br>
To buy bikes having toilets (it's true).<br>
It's their cup of tea;<br>
They don't stop to pee.<br>
It's a bicycle just built for loo.

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "There's a marketing idea for the British."</i>
<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:hmyers@globalnet.co.uk>FCA</a> writes 12/19/97</h3>
While visiting Santa's North Pole<br>
I saw a man boring a hole.<br>
I said "Aren't you Al " ?<br>
He said "Yes I am, pal<br>
And even here I make boring my role!"
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
I know just what I want for my present!<br>
Not a pear-treed partridge, but a pheasant !<br>
Though pheasant-plucking is<br>
Not a pleasant fucking biz<br>
I'll be the only peasant pheasant-plucker present!

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Apologies for the "fowl" language"</i>
<p>
While visiting Santa's North Pole<br>
They couldn't find Clinton a role.<br>
The presents were wrapped<br>
And the reindeer had crapped. . . . . . . . . . <br>
"I have an idea", said Bob Dole.
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
She murmured quite softly, "Dear Frank, it<br>
Wass quite a dismay<br>
To find you were gay,<br>
Can you pass my vibrator and crank it?"

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Must have been an old gasoline-driven machine !"</i>
<p>There's a question designed to perplex<br>
Why giraffes always smile during sex ?<br>
Some scientists surmise<br>
It's the commensurate size<br>
Of their sexual organs and necks!<p>
In England we call "Madaarna"  Madonna<br>
Though we don't call a banana a banonna<br>
But however you spiel it<br>
Madonna will peel it<br>
And her next act explain to His Honour !

<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Thanks to Al for reminding me that 
American English can rhyme Maddonna with Pihrana"</i><hr>

While sitting there spinning his dreidel<br>
Reuben's new bride said "I've played al-<br>
ong with your whims,<br>
Put on this slip worn in gyms<br>
But I'll not pour on oil with that ladle!"

<h3><a href=mailto:shaung@usa.net>The Friar (ex Dick Slimier)</a> writes 12/18/97</h3>
While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
Made me hot, so I asked her to wank it<br>
She cranked it and yanked it<br>
And spanked it and wanked it<br>
Then all of a sudden - she drank it!

<i>The poet comments, "Ahhhh the pleasures of wife!"</i>

There was a gay vampire with pluck<br>
Who was a bit down on his luck - 7<br>

Willing to be had<br>
But wondered which end he should suck!

<h3><a href=mailto:awillis@ix.netcom.com>Al Willis</a> writes 12/17/97</h3>
I would turn down a dancer from Bali<br>
And a chance to explore Mexicali<br>
For a little foreplay<br>
And a roll in the hay<br>
And a breakfast with sweet Parton, Dolly!
<hr>
<h3>Jabbo Stokes from 'Bama writes 12/17/97</h3>
Santa's helper, the venerable elf,<br>
Fetches toys down from high off the shelf.<br>
When Ol' Nick sees his backside<br>
Then he starts his "attack glide."<br>
He views "elf-butt" as toys for himself!

<p>
Santa's reindeer don't fare too much better<br>
   That is why they repose like the "Setter."<br>
   First, he lurks oh-so-near,<br>
   On his face that "lewd leer."<br>
   Later on, the deer's butt is much wetter!
<hr>
<h3>Yo shares a classic 12/17/97</h3>
There once was a man from Albtrass<br>
Whose balls were made from fine brass<br>
And in stormy weather<br>
They both clanged together<br>
And sparks can flying out his ass!
<hr>
<h3>DoGooder writes 12/16/97</h3>
We gay boys can make Christmas merry!<br>
With our big nuts so hairy<br>
we will both butt fuck <br>
Till we both bust a nut<br>
You should try it - it's not scary...

"That house has no toilet," said Danny.<br>
"I looked in each nook and each cranny.<br>
I guarantee you<br>
Cannot make poop-pe-doo.<br>
A house with no toilet's uncanny."

That Rudolph and Yukon Cornelius!<br>
Always up to something quite devious<br>
Asked Mrs. Claus<br>
To suck on their paws<br>
In a manner more lewd than the previous!
<p>
I know just what I want for my present!<br>
A plump and obliging young pheasant<br>
Whom I'd stuff from behind<br>
Til' it loudly opined<br>
"Roasting to me, is more pleasant!"

With his feet propped up on a table<br>
His scrotum does sag<br>
Like a used-up teabag<br>
Pouring on chicken soup by the ladle!

While cuddled up under the blanket<br>
If you see a bare ass, you must spank it<br>
If you feel a dick<br>
About three inches thick<br>
Then be a good friend and please yank it!

<i>Spank it and yank it seem to be the popular rhymes with this first line.  
Once again, we've come up with a toughie...</i><p>
You've been bad, old grouch Ebenezer!<br>
Had a young maid but then tried to squeeze 'er<br>
Into your bed<br>
To give you some head<br>
When denied you called her prick teaser!<p>

There was a young man from Aberystwyth<br>
Who bought a new record to twist with<br>
While reading the label<br>
He tripped over a cable<br>
And knocked off the thing that he pissed with!

She  searchs for gold<br>
But caught a cold<br>
And she tries heating herself up in a flying pan!

Fair Julia, who sold Christmas candy<br>
Said that her twat tasted twice as dandy<br>
And she'd let you try it<br>
Twice before you buy it<br>
On the bed that was handy.

Laetitia was a fine young lass<br>

Her secret was some major league sex<br>
Cause she really was dumb as an ass!

A lovely young thing<br>
Who looks like a queen<br>
But sucks and fucks like a peasant!

Fair Julia, who sold Christmas candy<br>
Said to Scrooge "Try my sweetmeats - they're dandy"<br>

"No bars, only drops - they're more handy !"
