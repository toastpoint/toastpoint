Death will catch up to us all<br>
It's no help being white, black or tall<br>
For you must comprehend - <br>
When it comes to the end,<br>
Size or color make no difference at all!

<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 03/28/96</h3>
With this limerick page I've been smitten<br>
By this doggerel, unleashed, I've been bitten<br>
Now I post this addendum<br>
How oft should I send 'em?<br>
Cause I've got quite a lot of them written!
<p>
<i>Oh, please, Jack, just send 'em around!<br>
The more the merrier, we've found!<br>
And tell all your friends<br>
We'll soon have no end<br>
Of limericks; in fact, they'll abound!

<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 03/25/96</h3>
An omphaloskeptic from Kent<br>
Sat engrossed, his legs crossed, in a tent.<br>
When they asked what engrossed him,<br>
He replied: "If you must im-<br>
Portune, I commune with my lint!"

I used to pen verse and then hide it,<br>
Fearing family and friends would deride it;<br>
But your web page gave voice<br>
To the verse of my choice - <br>
I'm exceedingly happy I spied it.

There once was a man from Algiers<br>
Who earned a small sum from his ears<br>
Which he flapped fro and to<br>
While he played a kazoo<br>
And drew few, but exuberant, cheers!

"DOWNSIZE" is the word - biz abuses it! <br>
And each time I hears it, I loses it!<br>
First they DOWNSIZE my check<br>
Then my benefits... Heck,<br>
Think I'll "DOWNSIZE" the next guy who uses it!
<p>
<i>The Sage looks disapprovingly at "Downsize", which isn't
really 
a word at all, any more than "Impact" is a verb...</i>

There once were some twins Siamese<br>
Quite proficient at chopping down trees;<br>
With a two-bladed axe,<br>
They would alternate whacks<br>
And fell giant redwoods with ease.

I can't quite recall or remember<br>
What it is like in December.<br>
All that I know<br>
Is that you get covered in snow:<br>
And that's simply what I remember.
<p>
It has come to that time of the year,<br>
When people don't cower in fear.<br>
They're happy all day,<br>
And frowns stay away.<br>
It is when you know that spring is here!
<p>
The flowers that grow on the mountain<br>
Beside the delicate pools of shimmering fountain.<br>
Tiny frogs leap around,<br>
Not making a sound<br>
By the flowers that grow on the mountain.

writes 03/18/96</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Cooter the oxaloacetate<br>
Loved his wife the pretty pyruvate.<br>
Their life was quite placid;<br>
She bore a citric acid<br>
Who ran away with the isocitrates!

<hr>
<h3>Baghwan writes 03/18/96</h3>
Bert's "billions of years" he professes<br>
Are not Hubble's, but astrophysicists' guesses.<br>
This Hubble, their token,<br>
Shows a great cosmic joke in<br>
This fact:  Godless lives are all messes.

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:ccoleman@ ag. Arizona.edu>Emily Coleman</a>
writes 03/09/96</h3>
There once was a teacher named Mrs. Scott<br>
Who tried go down a hill in a pot!<br>
She thought she could, <br>
And I wish she would,<br>
but I still like her a lot.

<hr>
<h3>Karen, DK writes 03/09/96</h3>
A little fat duck called Tony<br>
Wished so much he was a pony<br>
So when the other ducks swam in the lake<br>
He whinnied by mistake<br>
And that's the end of the story!

<hr>
<h3>Anonymous writes 03/06/96</h3>
Now Emily so liked her money,<br>
She stuck it to her body with honey.<br>
She'd roll and she'd play <br>
In the greenbacks all day -<br>
As a sight I would say it's quite funny!

<hr>
<h3>Baghwan shares a classic 03/05/96</h3>
There once was a lady from Bright<br>
Whose speed was much faster than light.<br>
She set out one day<br>
In the merriest way<br>
And returned on the previous night!

A wonderful tube is the Hubble:<br>
Peering out from its space-platform bubble<br>
Through billions of years,<br>
The telescope peers<br>
Turning creationist stuff into rubble!
