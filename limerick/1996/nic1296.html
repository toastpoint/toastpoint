<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 12/30/96</h3>
Old Jack Sprat sat down with a sigh<br>
And a piece of the nicest pumpkin pie.<br>
   He put in his thumb<br>
   And pulled out a plum<br>
And said, "Whatever is this? Oh my!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are a lot easier if one doesn't stick too rigorously to anapestic rhythm. "</i>

The smart Indian cow called Kamadhenu,<br>
Was explaining to the fallen Abhimanyu,<br>
Why cow is considered divine,<br>
To err human and to moo bovine,<br>
When he urged it to stop, saying "deja moo!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "`Kamadhenu' and `Abhimanyu' are names from Hindu mythology.
Used totally out of context in this limerick."</i>
<p>
In summers, we would go to Darjeeling,<br>
A place for which we share a common feeling,<br>
Listen to scores of a bumble bee,<br>
Sip cups of fresh mountain tea,<br>
And restore our faith in nature's healing.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I am not employed with the Dept. of India Tourism. "</i>
<hr>
<h3>Dan'l writes 12/28/96</h3>
There were really four brothers Alou,<br>
Jesus, Matt, and Phillipe too.<br>
Said the fourth, "I vow I'll<br>
Have the last name Powell<br>
To avoid being called Boog Alou."

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:jkersey1@ix.netcom.com>Monique de Plume</a> writes 12/26/96</h3>
Down the chim-eny sooty and black<br>
Poor old Santa came down with a whack<br>
When he looked at his clothes<br>
And the blood on his nose<br>
He left without bringing his pack!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Wrote this for my husband for a Christmas "poetry" reading to entertain the troops."</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
I once knew a guy from Manhattan<br>
Who liked girls dressed in silk and in satin.<br>
He drank only fine wine<br>
When he went out to dine<br>
And conversed just in Greek or in Latin!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I think I wrote this one myself, but parts of it I might have heard before.
After all, how many words rhyme with Manhattan?"</i>

<h4>Revenge Series</h4>
Kalkbrenner bought my limerick mansion,<br>
Hoping to incorporate some expansion,<br>
But lack of meter,<br>
Turned him into a heater,<br>
Which blew up at my poor scansion!
<p>
My learned friend Kalkbrenner,<br>
Wouldn't loan me even a tenner,<br>
But while playing tutor,<br>
At my computer,<br>
Offered to buy me a 'scanner'
<p>
The poor poet K.Sivaramakrishnan,<br>
Would try as hard as he can,<br>
But still lose syllables,<br>
Amidst the high decibels,<br>
From Kalkbrenner's shouts of `Scan Man Scan.'
<p>
After reading Kalkbrenner's taunts,<br>
Decided to stop my literary jaunts,<br>
For the humor and wit,<br>
That I tried to fit,<br>
Find no takers at my favorite haunts.
<p>
<I>Now, boys...nasty infighting doesn't belong here.  It belongs in the Naughty section.</I>

Those two talkative girls from Marseilles<br>
will reveal anything any deilles<br>
  about their romances,<br>
  their dreams and finances,<br>
but they'll always conceal what they weilles!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This one was born in English."  "And French, too!" smiles the Sage.</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 12/20/96</h3>
When contributing limericks here,<br>
The naughty variety, I fear<br>
Are much more my proclivity.<br>
So to show creativity<br>
A squeaky-clean one doth appear.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yin and Yang, don'tcha know..."</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:murthy_sk@hotmail.com>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan</a> writes 12/20/96</h3>
Tower of Pisa leaned sublime,<br>
Music was Big Ben's chime,<br>
In a thought momentary, <br>
I found them complementary,<br>
One has inclination & other the time.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "An overheard joke, converted."</i>
<p>

<hr>
<h3><a href=mailto:njackson@beeld.naspers.co.za>Laughing Stock</a> writes 12/20/96</h3>
The members of a local congregation<br>
Were filled with joy and elation<br>
For they had a new priest<br>
And to say the least<br>
She was more than your average revelation!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Another one that was written in Afrikaans (my first language) and then reworked into English. The Afrikaans version is better."</i>

There once was a boy from der Schweiz<br>
Whose dog was not very neiz.<br>
He said to his mom,<br>
"Please try to stay calm.<br>
His barkz are much worse than his beiz."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "I wrote this for my young nephew, Henry, who is currently living in der
Schweiz (German for Switzerland). "</i>
<p>
There once was a boy from St. Gallen<br>
Who came home from school quite crest-fallen<br>
His teacher said "squirming<br>
While speaking High Germing,<br>
Is not what we do in St. Gallen."
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This was written for my other nephew living in Switzerland. The Swiss 
speak their own dialect (Swiss German) until about 3rd grade when they
start learning High German as a second language (kind of like the Ebonics
that is going on in Oakland!:) By the way, this is a rare occasion in which
I repeated the first rhyme at the end. If O. Nash can do it, so can I!"</i>
<p>
<i>Yes, but he's dead...</i>
<hr>
Laughing Stock, your limerick was indeed placed in the <a href=nau1296.html#martin>Naughty</a> section.

<h3>Premer writes 12/18/96</h3>
There was a young man from New York<br>
Who ate chicken soup with a fork.<br>
He said, with a grin,<br>
As he shoveled it in,<br>
"It tastes good but I feel like a dork!"

<h4>A Poet Criticized By A Metronome</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Mr. K. Sivaramakrishnan<br>
Is a witty and erudite man.<br>
But on reading his verses<br>
Mr. Kalkbrenner curses:<br>
"Why on earth don't his limericks scan?!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "No offence, just abuse."</i>
<p>
<I>His are much closer than Mr. Ron's (in the naughty section).</I>
<hr>
<h3>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan writes 12/17/96</h3>
There was this guy called Jimbo,<br>
Whose wife made him slog in limbo,<br>
Work he did detest,<br>
But never did protest,<br>
Afraid she would appear akimbo!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There was this guy called Erique,<br>
Who was a very good critique -<br>
As a knowledgable sage,<br>
He scrutinized each page,<br>
And thus compiled the book 'Limerick'!
<p>
<I>Flattery will get you all sorts of places.</I>
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
He had promised to coach me quick,<br>
How to have public mannerisms slick,<br>
I had tried to display my best,<br>
But he commented after the test,<br>
"Supposed to scratch your nose, not pick."

There once was an atheist named Dwight.<br>
He refused to consider there might,<br>
Be a God who created - <br>
And so he debated.<br>
He'd better hope he is right!
<hr>
<h3>Trainman writes 12/16/96</h3>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
If you find yourself South Provo way,<br>
With nothing to do for the day<br>
Come visit Novell,<br>
Glimpse my personal hell<br>
And grab a phone - join the foray!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Netware support is just grand..."</i>
<p>
<I>Toast Point was in Orem a few years ago for WordPerfect training and had a great time.  As for user support, that's why TP is now a tech writer... :)</I>
<p>
To write a political limerick<br>
The candidate won't be named Tim or Nick.<br>
But the goals of the champ<br>
shan't dim Liberty's lamp<br>
even if times require him to trim her wick!

<hr>
<h3>Christopher Jacobs writes 12/16/96</h3>
School always takes up my time,<br>
And leaves me none for my rhyme.<br>
The problem may be true,<br>
But I'd lack the IQ<br>
For rhyme, if I didn't make time.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yes, I know I repeated the word time on the first and last line, but have you got a better idea?"</i>
<hr>

Scientific instruments never would budge,<br>
My readings would just be a big smudge,<br>
So for the final analysis,<br>
Be it cytolysis or catalysis,<br>
I would introduce a l'il factor of fudge.
<p>
In 'Planet Hollywood' is a 'Composers Shack',<br>
Where stars would enact their favorite with knack,<br>
Willis would choose Beethoven's part,<br>
Stallone would try to play Mozart,<br>
and Schwarzenegger would just say "I'll be Bach."
<hr>
<h3>Writerman writes 12/13/96</h3>
Have you heard the latest news, man?<br>
AOL HAS A NEW PRICING PLAN!!!<br>
Holy God Sakes alive--<br>
It's $19.95...<br>
And they dump you whenever they can!!!

There once was a man named Clegm<br>
Who was blessed with a great deal of phlegm;<br>
Ahegm, ahegm,<br>
Ahegm, ahegm,<br>
Ahegm, ahegm, ahegm.

<h3><a href=mailto:acmoore@acm.org>Plorqk Fuddlebitt</a> writes 12/11/96</h3>
There once was a boy from Prose<br>
Who liked to stick his toes up his nose<br>
If you asked if it smelled<br>
He'd say all was well'd<br>
But only the nose with the toes within knows!

<hr>
<h3>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan writes 12/10/96</h3>
She loved all sport, but played only kicksack,<br>
Visited all stadia, with her lucky backpack,<br>
Until gambling with college football,<br>
Turned to be a financial pitfall,<br>
Placed all her dollars, didn't win even a quarterback.
<h4>Heartbreak</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
First, she knocked it down like a skittle,<br>
Then she broke it, guess it was brittle.<br>
Had treasured it as art,<br>
For 'twas my only heart,<br>
Console she did, but too late & too little!

<h4>A Dog Biting Its Own Tail</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
In a kitchen, a dog is once said<br>
To have stolen an egg, and then fled.<br>
The cook took his knife<br>
And curtailed the dog's life.<br>
Now here's how the epitaph read: (return to beginning)
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is a compressed adaptation of a German rhyme sung to a Neapolitan tune."  <br>
Thanks for the correction.  In response to your question, <shrug>.</i>
<p>
<h4>A Crazed Dog Biting Its Own Tail</h4>
A lim'rick's a poem that should Scan-<br>
dinavia's the home of BergMan-<br>
dibles are to Chew-<br>
lips are blooms of red Hue-<br>
man beings like the taste of banan- (return to beginning)
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is an experiment that got out of hand."</i><br>
<I>Toast Point sort of gets it.</I>

<h3>Joe Schmoe writes 12/07/96</h3>
After seeing the limericks I've sent<br>
Most of them dirty and bent<br>
Since well I mean<br>
To live squeaky clean<br>
This I enter to repent!
<p>
<i>Toast Point grins..."Too late!"</i>

Early morn, she was visiting her beau,<br>
Who lived in a cabin on a plateau,<br>
Smoke from chimney and fog,<br>
Formed a cover of 'smog',<br>
Which, she observed, was a word portmanteau.
<p>
<i>The Sage tweaked the meter of the 3rd and 4th lines, he confesses.</i>
<p>
The singer kept asking "Where do you go ?",<br>
Soon a chorus joined chantin "O-O-Oye-O-O-O",<br>
A couple of reindeers did neigh,<br>
But still kept drawin his sleigh,<br>
From the white flowing beard came "Ho! Ho! Ho!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Some plagiarism from a chart-buster, but I guess it is permissible."</i>
<p>
The little green men from Mars,<br>
Landed in their inter-galactic cars,<br>
While analysing our civilization,<br>
They came to the realization,<br>
Intelligence of Earthlings is a farce!
<p>
<h4>Jump Start to Cooking</h4>
He had to shop-shop-shoppity-shop,<br>
Then had to chop-chop-choppity-chop,<br>
Dunno what culinary skill,<br>
Brought about a hot-oil spill,<br>
But he had to hop-hop-hoppity-hop!
<p>
<h4>Ghost of Hillaire Belloc</h4>
When I heard bells in the air near a hillock,<br>
They said 'twas the ghost of Hillaire Belloc,<br>
Working away at his rhymes,<br>
Chime after chime after chimes,<br>
Turned out to be from a cart drawn by a bullock.
<p>
His conversations were bouts of stammerisms,<br>
Every party had a discussion of his mannerisms,<br>
But when he rode a well boiled icicle,<br>
Instead of a well oiled bicycle,<br>
He was crowned the king of spoonerisms!
<p>
<i>Toast Point has always been fond of "The Lord is a shoving leopard".</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
In my town, there was an unprecedented hype,<br>
When they found a flower of unusual type,<br>
It hung from a woodland plant,<br>
Nodding at an awkward slant,<br>
Botanists exclaimed "Ah! the great Indian pipe!"
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Indian pipe is indeed a flower, scientific name for the same
is Monotropa uniflora"</i>
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A Britisher in Madras called Mr. Johnny,<br>
Was popular with locals for being brawny,<br>
When asked about his diet,<br>
He would usually keep quiet,<br>
Until he was caught gulping mulligatawny.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Mulligatawny is a kind of soup.  Folks may be interested to know that the w
word made it into English, probably from the Britishers when they ruled over
India. Mulligatawny, owns its origins to the language 'Tamil' , the majority
language spoken in the city of Chennai, (known previously as Madras) capital 
of Tamil Nadu, a state in India. It is assumed to be a morphed form of the 
combination of 'milagu' (meaning black pepper) and 'thanni' (meaning water)."</i>
<p>
<i>From here on, Toast Point insists that every limerick be submitted with 
extensive footnoting.</i> :)
<p>
<i>Toast Point inserted the <a href=nau1296.html#NASA>NASA limerick</a> in the 
Naughty contest.</i>

<h4>Lean Poetry</h4>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
An auditor claimed, "How abys-<br>
Mally wasteful the language now is!"<br>
To derision and howls<br>
He abolished his vowels - <br>
An nw h wrts ptry lk ths!

<i>The poet comments, "That's what you get if you leave decisions to auditors."</i>

The skin doc, as memory jogs,<br>
Was arrested and thrown to the hogs,<br>
Set patients wart kissin',<br>
And on toadstools pissin',<br>
Whilst changing them all into frogs!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
Young doc, dermatology flash,<br>
Was arrested and given the lash,<br>
With alchemist's call,<br>
Took warts, zits, and all,<br>
And transformed them into hard cash!

The guy called Chuck Singleton,<br>
Came to try luck at Tinseltown,<br>
But technology had him perplexed,<br>
He went home pretty complexed,<br>
Feeling he was too much a simpleton.

<hr>
<h3>Kumaramurthy Sivaramakrishnan writes 12/03/96</h3>
She was old enought to be made a Mummy,<br>
Still she played pharaoh and won an Emmy,<br>
She wore her costume to the stage,<br>
Confident that she had masked her age,<br>
Wrinkles were hid, but she looked too gummy.

An adaptable bird is the parrot,<br>
It will squawk and will screech for a carrot.<br>
But throw it some berries,<br>
It recites Hail Marys,<br>
Or anything else you might dare it!

An hard-headed Yank from Cape Cod<br>
Denied the existence of God.<br>
But, alas! when he died,<br>
He was sent to be fried,<br>
And he's STILL not sufficiently awed!
<p>
A tractable beast, the Professor:<br>
Though he pose as a slovenly dresser,<br>
Becomes tidy and clean<br>
Once he becomes Dean,<br>
Which is when he has learned to say, "Yessir!"
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
A wondrous machine, the computer:<br>
You can run 'er, and load 'er, and boot 'er,<br>
She's got memory and drive,<br>
(Why, she's almost alive!)<br>
But at times I could just execute 'er!
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
In seventeen seventy-three,<br>
There arrived a large shipment of tea.<br>
But the Yankees deep-sixed it,<br>
The tea-tax, they nixed it,<br>
And now we enjoy liber-tea!
<p>
Doc Baker told me with a sigh,<br>
"Your cholesterol level's too high."<br>
No more eggs do I crack,<br>
Now it's iron I lack,<br>
And the Doc, why, he eats humble pie!
<p>
My Gramps feels no cramps at fandango;<br>
His spine is just fine for the tango.<br>
But I don't think he oughta<br>
Attempt the lambada,<br>
'Cause he's old as the gold in Durango!
<p>
Some men known for jovial bonhomie<br>
Now carry a dour physiognomy.<br>
They blame the recession<br>
(As proved by regression),<br>
But I blame the blasted economy!
<p>
<I>Toast Point is awed by Emily's productivity.</I>

The tennis career of model Paulina Poliskova,<br>
Was bright but shortlived like any Super-Nova,<br>
In one particular tourney,<br>
She had a nice journey,<br>
Beat Steffi Graf, but lost to Helena Sukova.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Work of fiction, not intended to undermine tennis skills of players mentioned"</i>
