<h3><a href=mailto:jlhkitty@epix.com>jlhcat</a> writes 04/30/96</h3>
There was a fair maiden I knew<br>
Whose eyes were unusually blue<br>
And her naughty smile said<br>
She was much fun in bed<br>
She had eager men up the gazoo!

There once was a girl from Peru.<br>
One day when she'd nothing to do,   <br>
She sat on her stairs<br>
Picking cunt hairs<br>
One thousand, four hundred and two!

Came up with the syph,<br>
So now I look down and watch my cock rot away.

And so was her sister;<br>
They blew me right off of the bed!

I'm going to write yet another - <br>
This one goes out to my brother.<br>
Don't be upset by the fact,<br>
Your girlfriend I packed - <br>
For details please read the other!
<p>
She dropped by to see me (she said).<br>
Next thing, she was givin' me head!<br>
She first let me mount her<br>
Bent over the counter;<br>
To end it, I screwed her in bed!
<p>
We fucked as we sat on the floor<br>
And leaning against the front door<br>
At the end of every hour <br>
We would screw in the shower!<br>
Whe's becoming a bit of a bore...

An unfortunate parson named Birch<br>

To go elsewhere in spiritual search!
<p>
A stunted baseballer, a runt,<br>
Was always encouraged to bunt.<br>
The reason for that,<br>
A shortness of bat,<br>
Also made for shortness of cunt.

Of his mom, he was highly distressed.<br>

A politician seeking election<br>

<h3>Scoobie Doo writes 04/25/96</h3>

<h3>Van shares a classic 04/25/96</h3>
There was a young lad named Caruther<br>
Who crept into bed with his mother!<br>
I know it's a sin,<br>
Stuffing it in,<br>
But it's better than blowing my brother.

<h3><a href=mailto:ete2r@virginia.edu>Gooch</a> writes 04/25/96</h3>
I once met a beauty named November;<br>
Under her skirt, I discovered a member!<br>
So rather than scoff,<br>
I just whittled that dick right off,<br>
And gave her a night to remember!

<hr>
<h3>LIMBERICK writes 04/25/96</h3>
Gents, if you want to get laid,<br>
For a quickie, I know a young maid.<br>
She will clean out your pipes,<br>
In 3 or 4 swipes,<br>
That's why they call her Minute Maid!

<p>
She lay there asleep on my bed<br>
I proceded to position my head<br>
Before she awoke, <br>
I gave her a poke<br>
And then blew a load on the bed!
<p>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
A nun came into my place -<br>
She proceeded to sit on my face<br>
I felt the vacuum kick in <br>
Her twat sucked me right in<br>
And now I'm living in Grace!

<h3><a href=mailto:wjd7k@virginia.edu>Cornholio</a> writes 04/24/96</h3>
There was a young idol named Kurt Cobain,<br>
Who couldn't handle his stardom and pain,<br>
He tried to overdose,<br>
But didn't even go comatose,<br>
So he picked up a shotgun and blew out his brain.

<hr>
<h3>LIMBERICK shares classics 04/23/96</h3>
There once was a woman from Chicago<br>
Who had tits as black as charcoal.<br>
She could skin a man's prick<br>
So god damn quick,<br>
Sparks flew from his asshole!
<p>

There once was a man from Kent<br>
Whose member was so long that it bent<br>
To stay out of trouble <br>
He bent it in double<br>
And, instead of cumming he went!
<p>

<h3>and writes 04/24/96</h3>
"I have for you, love, just one question - <br>
Will you try any position I mention?"<br>
I decided to go <br>
When she answered me "no".<br>
I guess then a blow job is out of the question!

<hr>
<h3>Hubert  writes 04/23/96</h3>
There once was an kinky old slut,<br>
Who liked to get boned up the butt.<br>
But her man had a fear,<br>
Of entering the rear,<br>
And he could not get off a nut!
<p>
Out yonder lived a man named Bob,<br>
Who bragged of the world's biggest knob.<br>
One night his wife was bored,<br>
And wanted the big gourd.<br>
But instead she gave him a blowjob.

There was a young woman named Brandi<br>
Who'd take off her dress for some candy<br>
Or for money for rent<br>
Or for just fifty cents<br>
Or for anything else you had handy!
<p>
There once was a woman named Annie<br>
Who liked to have sex in the fanny;<br>
She could fuck all night<br>
And still remain tight!<br>
She got dates though she was an old granny!

<p>
There once was a woman named Muffy<br>
Who everyone thought was quite stuffy.<br>
But when paid enough money,<br>
She'd screw like a bunny<br>
Though her little pink tail wasn't fluffy.
<p>
There was an old pervert named Stark<br>
Who watched women jog through the park - <br>
He hid behind a tree<br>
And spanked his monkey<br>
Until he came all over the bark!

<h3>and the Brady Bunch Contest rears its ugly head...</h3>
<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
When Jeffrey Dahmer met the Bunch<br>
He knew it was more than a hunch<br>
That they soon would be dead<br>
And he'd keep all their heads<br>
In his fridge, to eat later for lunch!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Lady Di and Prince Charles lost their cools<br>
Trading crowns for the dunce caps of Fools!<br>
Chuck was caught scoring goals<br>
With Camilla P. Bowles,<br>
And Diana eschewed his crown jewels!
<p>
The royal facade further buckled<br>
With Fergie's big toe getting suckled - <br>
Her topless parading<br>
Meant Andy was trading<br>
His crown for the horns of a cuckold!
<p>
Randy royals can't help breeding malice<br>
When the sceptre they wield is a phallus;<br>
The sun never sets<br>
On their conquests, so let's<br>
Rechristen it "Fucking 'Em" Palace!

<h3>Pat shares a classic 04/23/96</h3>
There was a young fellow named Skinner<br>
Who took a young lady to dinner.<br>
They sat down to dine<br>
At a quarter to nine<br>
By a quarter to ten it was in her!<br>
(The dinner, not Skinner)
<p>
<i>This is part of a composite, composed for an after dinner speech. 
Unfortunately, the speaker dined rather well and when he rose to deliver the 
limerick was befuddled. This resulted in the following version:</i>
<p>
There once was a fellow named Tupper<br>
Who took a young lady to supper.<br>
They sat down to dine <br>
At a quarter to nine<br>
At a quarter to ten it was up her!<br>
(Not Tupper,<br>
Some other bugger named Skinner!)

"You, choirboy!" ordered the pastor,<br>
"Sing, damn you, sing! oh yes! Faster!<br>
Your rhythm and shake<br>
Makes my trembling loins quake<br>
Sing it out: I'm your lord and master!"
<p>

Of a lover she'd often had dreams:<br>
A man who could mend all her seams.<br>
Make her once again whole<br>
With a watertight soul,<br>
AND be very adept with whipped cream!

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
She sought out his manhood and robbed it,<br>
Then from the car window she lobbed it!<br>
For she'd pledged to the stiff<br>
At the height of their tiff,<br>
That when his john waned, she would bob it!

<hr>
<h3>Pedro writes 04/21/96</h3>
There was a young lady named Hubble<br>
Who enveloped herself in a bubble.<br>
She'd have happily died<br>
Wrapped safely inside,<br>
But the world's full of pricks, that's the trouble!

<h3><a href=mailto:mcalixto@ns.sinfo.net>alex,c</a>, on 4/20, wrote first...</h3>
"You, choirboy!" ordered the pastor<br>
Get away from Billie Jae<br>
Keep your hands away from people's pockets<br>
Don't tough what isn't yours,<br>
Don't fondle with others' behinds.
<p>
<i>commenting "I just made this up in a few minutes so it's nothing much."</I>
<p>
<h3>And then wrote</h3>
"You, choirboy!" ordered the pastor<br>
Get away from Billie Fryar<br>
Stop that touching right now<br>
Or I'll bring in the cow<br>
Who has always quenched my desires!

<h3>Rowdy Jack writes 04/19/96</h3>
At stroke 22, Jack the setter<br>
Was standing much taller and wetter<br>
With some soda applied<br>
To the tip, and each side<br>
For with Coke, such things always go better!
<p>
Two porcupines making a third<br>
Is a sight both obscene and absurd.<br>
Add the shrieks from each prick<br>
(of their quills, not his dick)<br>
And 'tis wondrous the creature's endured!

<hr>
<h3>Dale writes 04/19/96</h3>
"Don't do that!" the husband repeated<br>
When he found that his wife had excreted.<br>
She stopped and he cheered,<br>
But mostly he feared<br>
The supply of it would be depleted.

And mashed his balls into cream!

Who kept a dead old whore in his cave.<br>
The damned thing smelled,<br>

I'm glad that you like my long dick,<br>

I know where your ass is.<br>
The back hole's the best hole to stick!

In the neck, in the night,<br>
And then you'll be a vampire like me!"

She should pay him a price<br>
And consider it "severance pay"!
