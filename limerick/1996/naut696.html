Whilst performing lewd acts with her toes!

Alongside the hole where she prs.

Bent over and ripped her slacks<br>
When a man saw her bush<br>
He gave it a push<br>
And they stacked one more kid in a stroller.

And having his todger defiled!

And a smile on the face of her Doberman!

Those sheep give back more than they get!
