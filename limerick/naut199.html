<h3>Sandy Shalott writes 01/30/99</h3>
There was a man named Cleaver<br>
Who loved to feel his beaver<br>
But when it wept<br>
It was so unkept<br>
In some rubber he endeavoured.

<h4>Execrable Excretion</h4>
A chancre-pocked bedridden whore<br>
Developed a putrid cunt-sore.<br>
Her sheets and her cooze<br>
Got crispy with ooze<br>
And stalagmites formed on the floor.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Top that, you lame newbies!"</i>

Loved by all as a screwing machine.

A bearded old biker named Charlie<br>
Took a very long ride on his Harley<br>

Created no smog<br>
'Cause he ran it on hops and malt barley!

He picked up a girl<br>
Whom he took for a whirl<br>
And when done said,"I'd like to get in ya."

Miss Lewinsky and Clinton went far<br>
With their sexual acts most bizarre,<br>
But the substitute phallus<br>

When the mule does bray<br>
She had best get away<br>
Or she'll gag on a pool of its spew'll!

Exactly what does that mean?<br>
Are math guys all gay<br>
Or in some other way<br>
Of sciences: number two, on the scene.

Montezuma's revenge isn't sweet<br>
For the things that it does to your seat<br>
Makes your fundament sore<br>
Like your ass has been bored<br>
By a dick made of solid concrete!

Said Delilah to Samson, "Your hair<br>
Turned me on when it used to be there...<br>
Now to realize my fears<br>
A dick with two ears<br>
Takes its place on your shoulders so fair!

<h4>The Mystery Bulge</h4>
<img src=../gifs/goldstar.jpg align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
There was an old man from Orleans<br>
Who sprouted a bulge in his jeans.<br>
He’d walked in the park<br>
‘Till long after dark<br>
But couldn’t locate the latrines.

<h4>At the bar on Rigel 7</h4>

An alternate universe thrives<br>
In which I may lead other lives.<br>
My beck is my call!<br>
Now pour a high-ball!<br>
(They’re *much* cheaper than hyper-drives.)
<p>
<h4>Suckin' the Monkey:</h4>

The mate went to drink a night-cap.<br>
He fished out cap’s crank with a grap.<br>
He had to suck hard.<br>
The piss-pipe was scarred,<br>
‘Cause cappy had died of the clap.
<p>
<h4>Yo Mama</h4>
Don’t know what is so fucking cool,<br>
Unless it’s the tip of my tool.<br>
It seems there’s a draft<br>
From yo momma’s aft.<br>
Her fart-blasts are drying her drool.
<p>
She told me I was pretty sweet,<br>
Yet misses your miniscule meat.<br>
No wonder. Her bung<br>
Now leaks spunky dung -<br>
The kind that she tells me you eat.
<p>
<h4>Jed's Chamber-Pot</h4>
A crippled old captain named Jed<br>
Once kept a dead ram near his bed.<br>
His crew thought him queer<br>
When stuffed up its rear,<br>

<i>The poet comments, "For those of you that have had problems with HMO's"</i>

I encountered something thick and quite greasy<br>
A translucent glob<br>
An island of gob<br>
Of the goo that comes out when ya squeeze me!

<p>An anonymous poet online<br>
In a really short period of time<br>
Can compose something lewd<br>
Usually quite crude<br>
Except all those limericks of mine!

<p>An eagle whose wings had been clipped<br>
"I'm short", he quite dryly quipped<br>
"not only my wings <br>
But afew other things <br>
Like my beak and my balls and my dick!"

<h4>The Nubian Nun</h4>

Are essential to stand, walk, or hop;<br>
And they've been so designed<br>
That when seen from behind,<br>
The bottom, you'll find, is on top.
<p>

And IRS guy who's polite;<br>
If fact he's quite gay,<br>
One thinks that he may<br>
Create a new kind of "tax bite"!

Slew Abel, divine condemnation<br>
Was swift and gave pain;<br>
If he tried it now, Cain<br>
Would likely get three years probation.

Or didn't know much about readin'.<br>
She ignored a clear sign<br>
That said, "Here Do Not Dine",<br>
And got her ass thrown out of Eden.

This Earth with strange folk does abound,<br>
Who think the Earth's flat and not round,<br>
And it seems they cannot<br>
Tell, I'm sure you know what,<br>
From a hole which you find in the ground.

It pains me that girls with a brain<br>
Will choose from rough sex to abstain;<br>
What can give them displeasure<br>
Is another man's treasure,<br>
Like the spreader, the whip, and the chain!

There's a young Spanish girl named Donna<br>

<h4>by Loren C. Fitzhugh</h4>
Far better than cure is prevention,<br>
At least that was once the contention.<br>
Though it does seem to me,<br>
What with rife STD,<br>
That prevention equates with abstention.<br>
(STD - sexually transmitted diseases)

The Baptists can't hide their chagrin<br>
Now that Disney treats roomies as kin.<br>
So they boycott the house<br>
Of the Anti-Christ mouse,<br>
'Cause the mouse condones living in sin.

Disney OK'd the Gay Pride parades<br>
Causing those Southern Baptist tirades.<br>

Of that Mickey Mouse,<br>
And his goofy friends, the gay blades.

The young man's new penis dilator<br>
Was bought with hope he could sate her.<br>
But when tested in action,<br>
Her dissatisfaction<br>
Proved a serious satyr deflator!

While he unzipped his crotch, <br>

Lured a score of young girls to his loft.<br>

But the rest, it is said, had it soft.

<h4>by Anonymous</h4>
I enjoy making love to a dame<br>
With a fine callipygian frame. <br>
I'll admit if I must<br>
To some lust for the bust, <br>
But the feeling just isn't the same.
<p>
<h4>by Cruelty Jones</h4>
A construction worker thought it a howl,<br>
To address women with language most foul. <br>
Till a dyke on a bike<br>
Took a dislike... <br>
There's now a beer can in his bowel.
<p>
<h4>by Ed Rich</h4>
There was a damsel in a dress, <br>
Who caused quite an uproar, I guess. <br>
Her skirts, they did fly, clear up to the sky. <br>
The exposure was rare, but we didn't care. <br>
The big derriere was uncovered and bare, <br>
And everything else was a mess.
<p>
<h4>by John Miler</h4>
I abhor the onslaught of snow, <br>
When the cold makes a man...well, you know, <br>
Shrivel up like a raisin. <br>
I find it amazin'<br>
There exist any young Eskimo.

<h4>by Jim Thompson</h4>
With delicious breasts she is graced--<br>
Her nipples are honey to taste; <br>
My wife's pair is small, <br>
But I'm pleased after all, <br>
'Cause more than a mouthful's a waste!

<h4>by CB</h4>
Kathy Gifford has been in a stew--<br>
With her ex, she's have nothing to do! <br>

"Kathy, can I be frank with you."
<p>
<h4>by John Miller</h4>
Growled Pa Bear, "Someone's been in my bed!" <br>
"And mine," Ma said, "Look at that spread!" <br>
Baby bear, most polite, <br>
Gently put out the light. <br>
"Nighty night, folks," was all that he said.
<p>
<h4>by John Miller</h4>
As a kid, when we rode on the bus, <br>
Deep questions we'd often discuss: <br>
"Would it come off divine, <br>
Or just blow out her spine, <br>
If Superman did it with Lois?"
<p>
<h4>by Katie Frame</h4>
That fellow who kept a dead whore<br>
In his cave, I suppose on the floor: <br>
True, he'd save lots of money, <br>
But what good's a dead honey, <br>
'Cause her blowjobs ain't shit anymore.
<p>
<h4>by Chris Papa</h4>
Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims' first feast, <br>
In the frigid and nasty Northeast; <br>
They were warmly dressed, <br>
Though I would have guessed, <br>
The Indians were wearing their least.
<p>
<h4>Verbatim, Lang Quart 1990</h4>
Twin sisters, named Coral and Carol, <br>
Were laid out in their finest apparel. <br>
Their life had been moral; <br>
For Carol a chorale<br>
Was sung, and for Coral, a carol.

<h4>by Martin Hubbard</h4>
My semi-demented Aunt Alice<br>
Went to dine at the archbishop's Palace; <br>
But she fell into sin, <br>
Drinking far too much gin, <br>
And pissed in his second-best chalice.
<p>
The Archbishop, surprised, said, "O daughter!<br>
You have done what you shouldn't have oughter;<br>
And in cases like this,<br>
While we don't call it piss,<br>
I'll be damned if it's quite 'Holy Water.'"
