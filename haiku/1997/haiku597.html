Biker hit by car<br>
Death sought me but I was safe<br>
Landing in God's hand
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Yesterday I was hit by a car while out on my bicycle.  Those that witnessed
the accident said that I should be dead, and I tend to agree.  But I had 
someone on my side....."</i>

Inside the city<br>
snow swirls into an alley<br>
a big box wiggles

Army of spiders<br>
fight for garden possession<br>
Wish them victory

<h3>CAM writes 05/29/97</h3>
On the grassy Knoll<br>
A fluttering visitor<br>
Feasts on spring's Nectars
<p>
The stairs Cascading<br>
Marbled waterfalls where you<br>
Stand so elegant
<p>
She rides the canyon<br>
From dawning to dusk, spellbound<br>
The sabertooth child
<p>

Or simply forget?

You hold your secrets<br>
Tightly clasped against your heart<br>

Once again we fail<br>
To meet the needs of others<br>
As we gorge ourselves.

Memorial Day<br>

So we could write free.

<h3>Richard Capella writes 05/25/97</h3>
In the woods I see<br>
morels peeking out at me<br>
like wrinkled old gnomes
<p>
another spring comes<br>
and I see apple blossoms<br>
lovely as ever
<p>
robin on her nest<br>
four blue eggs as lovely and<br>
as dear as jewels
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
ebon starry night<br>
sounds; surreal, so real<br>
beauty of the beasts

<h3><a href=mailto:jcree@worldramp.net>Jan Cree</a> writes 05/25/97</h3>
Desolate desert<br>
Always sunny, not rainy<br>
Yet a cactus blooms
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Gold in the rivulets<br>
Silver found in the black hills<br>
Baubles for the ears
<p>
Whippoorwills singing<br>
Rivers flowing endlessly<br>
A touch of nature
<p>
Blue sky so high<br>
Setting sun so very low<br>
Meeting together
<p>

<h3>Bashed Oh writes 05/25/97</h3>
I met her, the one<br>
Women in spring dresses<br>
Don't even turn my head
<p>
she returns to him<br>
That person she doesn't love<br>
The one she wishes she did
<p>
Hear the spring peepers<br>
She is lying with another<br>
Winter is coming
<p>
Forget her they say<br>
The flowers are all blooming<br>
But so does my love
<p>
Sunshine, summer breeze<br>
Glowing in her pajamas<br>
I felt my heart break
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Winter chill, train tracks<br>
She kissed me, for forever<br>
My life has changed
<p>
My semen on her<br>
She rubs it into her skin<br>
Will something grow now?
<p>
I had thought this spring<br>
She and I, growing, learning<br>
Would start our journey
<p>
In spring life returns<br>
Flowers bloom, lovers embrace<br>
But not her and I
<p>

Silly court-martials<br>
For adulterous soldiers:<br>
Petty generals

In defiance to the macho military. . ."</i>

<h3>Richard Nedervelt writes 05/24/97</h3>
I am an acorn<br>
Falling from heavy stretched limbs<br>
Rising on my own.
<p>
We turn from darkness<br>
Denying winter exists<br>
Spring goes unnoticed
<p>
Sunshine through raindrops<br>
Peach orchards in full blossom<br>
Catches a child's smile
<p>
<h4>Lady Fingers</h4>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" align="right" alt="Gold Star!"> 
Silent and gentle<br>
Her unspoken love is heard<br>
Soft, Soothing, and Strong.
<p>
<h4>Pondering</h4>
Still beneath blossoms<br>
Listening to one heart - one breath<br>
Reflecting on life.
<p>
<h4>Sand</h4>
Sand washed onto shores<br>
A single grain - unnoticed<br>
Pail pearls without flesh
<p>
<h4>Fancy Free</h4>
Wind and I whistle<br>
Running through lush fields of greens<br>
A child fancy free
<p>
<h4>Obaasan</h4>
Caressing winds blow<br>
Sparrows sing to grandmother<br>
Grains of rice grant smiles
<p>

Grackle skips down fence<br>

Visibly pleasant,<br>
Spills a harvest of flakes, blames,<br>
His fickle spoon.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Is this hackneyed imagery ?"</i>
<p><I>Harvest of flakes?  No.  But the Sage doesn't see how 'visibly pleasant' fits in with the other two lines.</I>
<p>
<I>The poet responds, "Thought u wld never ask. Expln. for the `harvest of flakes' haiku:<br>
1st. it was a spoof of the `harvest of stars .. fickle moon' one.<br>  
2nd. `flakes' hv double context as in snow & corn (as if u didn't know ;-))
with the snow in a field, vegetation suffers and the only
harvest that a peasant can expect is snow, which though is 
`visibly pleasant' invites back breaking job. In this context the spoon is something else.
(i hv never called a spade a spade ;-))<br>
In the corn context,  the `visibly pleasant' is the
person ( who might well be the `invisible peasant' (since many did
see through him anyway ;-))) on his breakfast table. "</i>
