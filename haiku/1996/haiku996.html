Seven already!<br>
The sky darkens while sun sets.<br>
A leaf's turn to fall.
<p>

final entry<br>
today I died

my life combined with a story from the civil war."</i>

Dipping your toes<br>
The rippling water<br>
Broken perfection

Talking on the phone<br>
I hear a beep.  "Hold on, 'k?"<br>
On.  Off.  On.  "Hello?"

Autumn emerges<br>
from the hot womb of summer<br>
The trees shake with joy
<p>
The tree shadows dance<br>
to the rhythm of the wind<br>
all day and all night
<p>
Mother Nature heals<br>
ill flesh and ill souls on Earth<br>
Respect her wisdom
<p>
The Earth ate the sun<br>
and all the marshmallow clouds<br>
Now it is nighttime
<p>

Hot and thirsty, I<br>
drink the sweet iced tea and <br>
honeysuckle air.

Falling needles knife<br>
The ground as Pinetrees prepare<br>
To withstand winter

A little autumnal alliteration"</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:NKaufmann@worldbank.org>Noel Kaufmann</a> writes 09/23/96</h3>
Behold the ego<br>
Set in glowing emptiness<br>
On the edge of time
<p>
Young Republican<br>
Finger writhing up his nose<br>
It's Izod Lacoste!

Springtime, sharp and clean<br>
Mountains have their eloquence<br>
Promulgating green
<p>
I think I would like<br>
To have something of a snack<br>
Baked beans would be nice

<h3>Mako Otsuji writes 09/21/96</h3>
Death is a banker <br>
Everyone has to pay now<br>
Now, any questions?

<img src=../../gifs/goldstar.jpg alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Rising in the air<br>
butterflys eclipse the sun<br>
stained glass wings in flight
<p>
Brujo sets the scene<br>
faithful, stoic penitent<br>
waits for medicine
<p>
Crooked stony teeth<br>
rise up sharp to meet the stream<br>
falling through the air
<p>
Dawn illuminates<br>
soft green bed for serein's child<br>
dew-drop on a leaf
<p>

<h3>Ken CooK writes 09/20/96</h3>
Butterflies dancing,<br>
Tossed gently by currents of air,<br>
Wings like eyelashes.

Return, oh my heart<br>
To love and nature.  Disturb<br>
Not the fair garden.

Jewels of green and blue<br>
treacherously sparkling cool<br>

hedonistic dreams

Sharpened harpoons fly<br>
red blood stains barnacled flukes<br>

Sky forest of stars<br>
holusbolus they ignite<br>
like a battle cry

Sun on horizon<br>
Whisps of clouds of amber hues<br>

Deserted margin<br>
Sand clutching warm tidal pool<br>
As peace offering.

Thunder crying by its side<br>
Frightened creatures hide

Dear Sage, what has<br>
happened to my haikus which<br>
I sent last week?

<I>We received none, sir<br>
Possibly we misplaced them?<br>
Send them again, please...

Hope, like small embers,<br>
Burns strong, hotter and brighter<br>
Just before dying

a proud and bright sun<br>
a burst of warm alpenglow;<br>
then a dark blanket

two spirits take wing

<i>The poet comments, "How is this for a first attempt at poetry by a C.P.A.?  I had sudden inspiration and sat down and wrote 6 of these.  Should I quit or think up more?"<br>
Toast Point responds, "More, more!  Not to scare you, but my <a href=../wumpus.html>Wumpus</a> works for the AICPA..."</i>

Cardinal stares me down<br>

I avoid his helpful eyes
