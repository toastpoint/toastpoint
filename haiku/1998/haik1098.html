Please do hold the pickle

Unexpected grace<br>
The fragile smoke of morning<br>
Squandered on distrust

<i>The poet comments, "Beautiful fairy dusted plumes on my smoke tree.  Had to take a second look
to see if it was real."</i>

<h3><a href=mailto:ALostCoin @ aol.com>Greg San</a> writes 10/30/98</h3>
Dark morning highway<br>
Bright meteor crosses sky<br>
And silently dies.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "
Inspired by the sight of a long hanging shooting star, while on my way to work early one morning."</i>
<p>Late night returning<br>
We stop to gaze in wonder<br>
at the starry sky.

<h3>Stuart Reed writes 10/30/98</h3>
<h4>Glenn's Off Again</h4>
Weightless environs<br>
Prove gravity is something<br>
You can't rely on.
<p>
<h4>A Duty To Beauty</h4>
I must recharge my<br>
Batteries so that I may<br>
Discharge my duties.
<p>
<h4>And An Album I Must Buy</h4>
Lauryn Hill, Fugee<br>
Of old, has a voice of gold,<br>
Breathless breath control.
<p>
<h4>It Was Not A Blunt Instrument</h4>
Knock me down, Snoopy,<br>
Blunted on Reality<br>
Was superhuman.
<p>
<h4>Sano-Wrap Clean</h4>
An object lesson<br>
In hermetic sealing is,<br>
Oddly, my feeling.
<p>
<h4>Hiccup</h4>
Rap and rock and roll<br>
Bred, I am told, hip hop. Hip<br>
Hop. Hip hop. Hip hop.
<p>
<h4>Put A Candle In Your Gourd</h4>
Your pumpkin's ripened<br>
So it must be Halloween.<br>
So hollow it out.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The next eight are haiku written whilst milking cows. </i>
<p>

<h4>On This Occasion</h4>
I have a choice of<br>
Elton John's or Pie-toon's voice.<br>
I prefer Pie-toon's.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "Pie-toon is my employee. </i><p>
<h4>He's Tall For A Thai</h4>
Inordinately <br>
Fond is what I am of this<br>
Pie-toon. And his tunes.
<p>
<h4>For Instance</h4>
He has a little<br>
White plastic bird pinned to his<br>
Mosquito netting.
<p>
<h4>A Song Of Echoing Longing</h4>
When he sings his voice<br>
Echoes in the rafters of<br>
The milking parlour.
<p>
<h4>A Simian Tang</h4>
He smiles like a chimp,<br>
Showing all his teeth - or a<br>
Strong orang-utang.
<p>
<h4>Why Does He Smile So?</h4>
<p>He works twelve hours a<br>
Day, seven days a week. You'd<br>
Think he'd be bitter.

Blood-red moon rises <br>
Vampires and ghouls awake<br>
Halloween is here!
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "This is my first haiku.  I was just having a little fun, but I would love to see some comments on it!!
"</i>
<p>
<i>Very nice.  You could have used "goblins" instead of "ghouls" to make the middle line 
seven syllables, but it wasn't necessary.</i>
<p>
Wind breaths into me<br>
filling my soul with content.<br>
I sigh with the trees.

Gathering at dusk<br>
A muttering of mallards<br>
Lost to river's mist.
<p>Autumn tangled shades<br>
Multicolored disarray<br>
Stirred by cooling winds.
<p>Still I do live on<br>
Your memories breath for me<br>
Rustling green leaves.

Time is mending wounds<br>
Slowly, one stitch at a time<br>
No bandage needed
<p>You promised me love<br>
You delivered betrayal<br>
You left me crying.
<p>Love is just a word<br>
Exploited  in greeting cards<br>
Used to fill deep hearts.
<p>Shy petals  unfold<br>
Squinting at the blazing sun<br>
Slowly sip dew drops.

The sun shines brightly<br>
The trees reflect jewel-tone hues <br>
Cool wind warms my heart.

<i>The poet comments, "If I Could get any constructive criticism, please write me"</i>
<p>
<i>We try not to get into lengthy criticism, but... this haiku is interesting, which is a 
good start.  The first line is a little cliched, but the last line, seemingly contradictory, 
is thought-provoking.</i>

Rumble of engines<br>
Exhaust pipes belch pollution <br>
One goal: get home.

Angels are singing<br>
Mortals hear sweet  choir<br>
Beaming sun conducts

Statistics change no values<br>
Grief arrives too late.

Scowling,stormy sky<br>
Thunder vents nature's fury<br>
Lightning cracks its whip

the wind whips my hair<br>
Mother earth cradles me close<br>
Safe, warm, and naked.

<i>The poet comments, "I have more...you know I can't stop."</i>

Distant rhythms beat<br>
I climb a golden staircase<br>
seeing only you.

I question some things<br>
drink in  the sun litwaters<br>
And find the answers.

<h4>The Seedy Bottomes Of Fingering-ho</h4>
Mind you, this dude lived<br>
In Fingering-ho, so he<br>
Was name sensitive.
<p>
<h4>What Could They Have Been Thinking?</h4>
I never worked up<br>
The nerve to ask the meaning<br>
Of Fingering-ho.
<p>
I mean, how does a<br>
Town get a name like that? Was<br>
It pulled from a hat?

<h4>The Colossality of
Rome</h4>
The Colosseum<br>
Is the modern museum<br>
Of gladiators.
<p>
Moving on is not <br>
My strong suit. I go slow with<br>
The devil I know.
<p>The name of this cow<br>
Is Melody, which is a<br>
Mellifluous name.
<p>In my dotage, I've<br>
Developed a passion for<br>
Comforting motions.
<p>Crossing oneself is<br>
OK but better to lay<br>
Your hand on your gut.
<p>I kid you not. A<br>
La Vincent Vega as played<br>
By John Travolta.
<p>For lasting comfort,<br>
Spread the flat of your hand flat<br>
Across your stomach.
<p>Trust Italians<br>
To come up with comforting<br>
Motions. All that guilt.

<h4>Melody's Moods</h4>
Melody moos. She's<br>
Suffering from the old post-<br>
Partum bovine blues.

<i>The poet comments, "Post-partum translates into post-natal in the human
world. The above were written whilst milking cows. "</i>

<h4>Deliverance</h4>
He who stands still will<br>
Become road kill and then a<br>
Hillbilly's dinner.

<h4>Cultivate The Following</h4>
<p>An artiste seeks to<br>
Cultivate a following.<br>
Fans hear artistes sing.
<p>Some peripheral<br>
Peregrinations are called<br>
Peripatetic.
<p>Diogenes thought <br>
That life in a barrel was<br>
A barrel of laughs.
<p>To all intents and<br>
Purposes, his thinking was<br>
Clearly pathetic.
<p>Nonetheless, had he <br>
But known it, he's now viewed as<br>
Being authentic.
<p>Why? Well, life in a<br>
Barrel brings forth perceptive<br>
Perspectives. To wit,

Teams of oxen pull<br>
The plough, making furrows with<br>
The sweat of their brow.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The first one is called 'Sweating Oxen.' The next one is called 'I Steadily Sped.'"</i>
<p>Having rushed headlong<br>
Into being steadfast, I've <br>
Passed my sell-by date.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The next five are called 'Longshoremen Long To Be Sure.'"</i>
<p>Schizophrenia<br>
Is two sides of multiple<br>
Personalities.
<p>Circumstances tend<br>
To dictate what will surface<br>
And what lays in wait.
<p>His job is murky.<br>
Extricating sanity from<br>
The muddy madness.
<p>Muddy Waters sang <br>
The blues and are what all the<br>
Madmen long to lose.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The next three are called 'Hall Of Mirrors.'"</i>
<p>Saddled with being<br>
Multi-faceted, we get <br>
Exasperated.
<p>We must always ask<br>
Ourselves which one of us is<br>
Doing the talking.
<p>The answer depends,<br>
Friends, on which one of us is<br>
Doing the asking.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "The last one is called 'Earth In The Air.'"</i>
<p>Small potatoes are<br>
Packed into hefty sacks, stacked<br>
At the greengrocer's.

Sunlit Butterflies<br>
Float on cool autumn breezes<br>
Into my windshield

<h4>Genes Are Full Of Beans</h4>
And you will feel dumb.<br>
You will fell dumped on.<br>
Fee, fie, foe and fum,
<p>
I smell the blood of<br>
An Englishman. They who dump<br>
On Angles get axed.
<p>Anglo-Saxons were<br>
Not put upon by Picts or<br>
Celts. Romans neither.

<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Graphic: Gold Star!" align="right"><img src="../../gifs/blank.jpg" align="left">
A word of advice<br>
To one and all. Never get<br>
Bengay on your balls.
<p>
It's advantageous<br>
Not to be outrageous, but<br>
So titillating.

<h4>Verbal Hi-jinks</h4>
Hermits are cranks. Hence,<br>
Hermits are cranky. Maybe.<br>
Word hanky-panky.

<h4>Numismatists Don't Coin Phrases</h4>
J. D. Salinger.<br>
What a name. What quality<br>
In nomenclature.
<p>
<h4>Crank That Jive</h4>
Caught by a wry smile.<br>
The distance between pain and<br>
Joy shrank by a mile.
<p>A shared care is a<br>
Care halved. Half the care gets starved<br>
For affection. Dies.
<p>Go tell that to the<br>
Cranky hermit. He permits<br>
Very few hi-fives.

Steam rose like a dream<br>

as we stared at stars.

against my cold heart.
<p>His legs are soft on<br>
mine as he quietly dreams<br>
under a new moon.
<p>One warm moonlit night<br>
my innocence is shattered...<br>
stars fall in sorrow.
<p>I'm drunk on your love...<br>
My grin is silly on this <br>
cool October night.
<p>The darkness of this<br>
moonless night cannot invade<br>

<h4>Rural Lore</h4>
How do you get a<br>
Calf out of a cow when its<br>
Head is turned backwards?
<p>
Gross as it may sound,<br>
Pull it round by sticking your<br>
Finger in its eye.
<p>
<h4>Halted In My Tracks</h4>
Ah. I've fallen in <br>
Love with a salt of the earth.<br>
One meets so few salts.
<p>
<h4>Salts Decry Haste</h4>
There's certainly no<br>
Shortage of well-meaning wimps,<br>
Prim and proper pimps.
<p>Lots of lesser lights<br>
Will put a crimp in your style,<br>
But salts will add taste.
<p>
<h4>Salted Beauty</h4>
There's not much mystique<br>
To a salt. You can tell a<br>
Salt by his physique.
<p>Specifically,<br>
The mystery of a salt<br>
Is held in his hands.
<p>That is to say, look<br>
No further. Salts stick fingers<br>
Into calves' eye sockets.
<p>And it sounds really<br>
Ugly, but the end result<br>
Is beautiful life.
<p>
<h4>Mighty Slight</h4>
Keeping a beacon<br>
Shining in the lighthouse might<br>
Keep ships off the rocks.
<p>
Notches in one's belt<br>
May be the cause of heartfelt<br>
Or heartless applause.
<p>And might might make right.<br>
Pigs might take flight. The chances,<br>
You might say, are slight.
<p>
<h4>Our Men, Too, Have A Menu</h4>
Read, mark, learn and then<br>
Inwardly digest. Chew the<br>
Menu of culture.
<p>
<h4>Localised Oak Trees</h4>
You'll be edified<br>
By education on our<br>
Cultural menu.
<p>New it may not be,<br>
But new may not be what we<br>
Seek, taking a peek.
<p>We may seek that which<br>
Has withstood the test of time.<br>
Like your local oak.
<p>
<h4>Somewhat Shady</h4>
"Curves in all the right<br>
Places," he said, shadowing<br>
The shape of a vase.
<p>
<h4>Leisurely Pleasure Me</h4>
Even after all<br>
These years he has a shady<br>
Eye for the ladies.
<p>
He's wrinkled and shrunk,<br>
But remembers what it was<br>
Like when he had spunk.
<p>
<img src="../../gifs/goldstar.jpg" alt="Graphic: Gold Star!" align="right"><img src="../../gifs/blank.jpg" align="left">
He remembers both<br>
Pungency and urgency,<br>
And sighs leisurely.

<h4>Priceless Nomenclature</h4>

As never before. You'll write<br>
Poetry galore.
