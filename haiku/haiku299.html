Mad to the layman.

<i>The poet comments, "These are haiku written whilst milking cows and are called
'Cowed'"</i>
<p>Experimental <br>
Ideas double back when<br>
They hit cul-de-sacs.
<p>Opponents of my<br>
Prejudices have sweeping<br>
Inaccuracies.
<p>Leading ladies star<br>
In celluloid fantasies<br>
With cellulose breasts.
<p>Flickering licks of<br>
Painted flame dance across the<br>
Animated screen.
<p>When a mind holds forth<br>
It does so through tongue or pen<br>
Or typewriter key.
<p>
Yaks and other beasts<br>
Of burden carry packs up<br>
The Himalayas.
<p>Thought blankets action<br>
With a snowy avalanche<br>
Of indecision.
<p>I'm only a mule,<br>
Everybody's fool. Ears flap<br>
In a dunce's cap.
<p>Dirigibles brought<br>
Terrible tribulations<br>
From the open sky.

<p>You to me are so<br>
Delectable. I am so<br>
Ineffectual.
<p>How do we look to<br>
The outside world or is that<br>
None of our concern?
<p>Evidently, pain<br>
Can be sugar-coated if<br>
Injected in veins.
<p>Row upon row of<br>
Ant-like humans march in step<br>
To weekly pay checks.
<p>A little knowledge<br>
Gives the ignorant asshole<br>
Mountains of courage.

Lose his lucrative life so<br>
He out and out lied.

The morning, shining light comes<br>
Fresh, smelling flowers

Starting a new day

Looking for a place to start<br>
A journey so far

Your back there is no chance of<br>
Turning back the clock.
<p>Shall we put aside<br>
Our innate differences,<br>
Our inborn guidelines?
<p>Genes have pools in which<br>
They squander far more often<br>
Than they propagate.
<p>Why do monks shave their<br>
Pates? How can a haircut be<br>
Thought of as holy?

Where salmon and their kin are<br>
Not in evidence.
<p>Fourscore years of three<br>
Square meals and what do you get?<br>
Middle-aged spare tyres.

From a surfeit of volume,<br>
As do most D.J.'s.
<p>It's the whispier<br>
Harmonics that are ignored<br>
In histrionics.
