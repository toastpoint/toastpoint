View is biblical.

<i>The poet comments, "These are haiku written whilst milking cows and are not called anything."</i>
<p>There comes a point when<br>
Birds meet bees and have to learn<br>
Other harmonies.
<p>Death defying flight<br>
Was first undertaken by<br>
Wilbur. Wilbur Wright.
<p>A fraction of the<br>
Time spent getting and spending<br>
Should be spent saving.
<p>Don't expect to be<br>
Excepted. Self-deception's<br>
Highly contagious.
<p>Crumbling Oreos,<br>
Dunked in tea, were fished for with<br>
Spoons, desperately.
<p>You go forward till<br>
There's no turning back. It is,<br>
It seems, a fast track.
<p>Have you had your fill?<br>
Now you swallow bitter pills<br>
For indigestion.
<p>A recruiting drive<br>
Cannot succeed without an<br>
Ideology.
<p>Restrained disdain strained<br>
Otherwise agreeable<br>
Mutual friendships.

I saw you standing<br>
by the lake, but then you fled<br>
and became a dream.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "To Whom May Concern,
<p>
When you require Shakepsearesque poetry...let me know.  Until then, I shall 
humbly submit my best effort, even if it is for naught more than your
viewing pleasure.

<h3>Joyna writes 04/29/99</h3>
this is what I see<br>
when I look in the mirror<br>
..a lonely, sad, child
<p>the broom sweeps as one<br>
with me and my silent tears<br>
that go unnoticed
<p>the boy which I loved<br>
I once saw with another<br>
and inside...I died.

<i>The poet comments, "This is an inverse haiku - I figure, however, that since I am an American
approprating the Japanese poetic culture, I may as well allow myself to stray 
from the classic form.

annoyance at this child's handling of his mother's letters, until I saw the big smile on his face as he watched the mail disappear, a

Brittle bristles snap<br>
Under the gentle pressure<br>
Of a razor blade.
<p>Were you distracted<br>
By having been selected<br>
Or were you absorbed?

Trick questions compromise the<br>
Intellects of dopes.

The rule not so long ago,<br>
Not democracy.
<p>Kangaroos use tails<br>
As rudders. They're like a boat.<br>
They're a boat that hops.
<p>Disciplinary <br>
Sanctions will be imposed to<br>
Make you toe the line.
<p>Sleight of hand made the<br>
Slight look grand. Yes indeed, it<br>
Glorified the bland.

Myself with worry.

I somehow doubt it.
<p>Along with every<br>
Shimmering globule on a<br>
Chandelier, I shake.
<p>It is the little<br>
Differences that will make<br>
All the difference.
<p>Pendulous pear drops,<br>
Tear drops in amber in an<br>
Eternal slumber.
<p>Order, order, court<br>
Adjourned. Take the evil witch<br>
Out and have her burned.
<p>Some new free style shit.<br>
You can't coop a chicken and<br>
Not attract a fox.

Snow lies on bare branches.<br>
Running water over stones.<br>
Ice melts, dripping, wet.
<p>
Icicles hanging.<br>
Dripping from gutters and eaves.<br>
Slow, stately, drip, drip.

Breath puffs in sunlight<br>
Fingers tingle under gloves.<br>
Sun-melted snow puddles.
<p>
Rosy nose and cheeks.<br>
Harsh, wet, gloves scour cold numbed face.<br>
Red faces shine bright.
<p>
Children's voices ring.<br>
Laughing voices in chill air.<br>
Adults smile softly.
<p>
Fresh green bud on limbs.<br>
First green stems poke through thin snow.<br>
No blossoms.  Too soon.

Spring comes stirring, not yet born.<br>
Death to life once more.
