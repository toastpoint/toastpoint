<h3>Stuart Reed writes 03/31/99</h3>
How does it feel to<br>
Be only minimally<br>
Useful, Ulysses?
<p>He's just a ghost out<br>
Of the blue. No clues as to<br>
His identity.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are called 'Aesop Moral'"</i>
<p>Not being vanquished<br>
Feels to the underdog like<br>
Mission accomplished.
<p>Patterns can persuade<br>
A man to see the hand of<br>
God in the random.
<p>Spartan conditions<br>
Appeal to the stoic as<br>
Having aesthetics.
<p>Virgin vagina,<br>
Hymen intact, fetches a<br>
High price in child brides.
<p>Pyrotechnics based<br>
On lasers lack the bang of<br>
Chinese dynamite.
<p>Most mistakes are no<br>
Great shakes. There isn't very<br>
Often much at stake.
<p>Swathed in swaddling bands,<br>
All you can see of baby<br>
Is its face and hands.
<p>The battle of the<br>
Saxes in the streets. Kansas<br>
City. New Orleans.

<i>The poet comments, "here, neither the word god nor the word michaelangelo
should be capitalized. threw out my copy of strunk and
white's "Elements of Style" years ago. the
phrase, "coltranes addiction", as written
connotates both the descriptive idea that 
coltrane is addiction, hence, the edited 
"Coltrane's addiction" as well as the re-echoing
 of the previous phrase "ellingtons shot of
coltrane."  coltrane re-emphasized for effect.
ellington took his shot, or maybe his shot 
pierced his wiggling earthworm vien,
who knows. possibly it just flowed out as a 
duality while listening to his, i.e. ellington's, 
compostion "a small purple flower" an
agonizing groaner of a piece devoted to, 
not inspired by, coltrane's addiction. who 
knows? yet duke wrote the notes. i like seeing
drops of miscellaneous paint spotting around
in visual and verbal compostions, it's freshness
reveals the path of creativity, or lack thereof.
also threw out my copy of Hyakawa's "Language in 
Thought and Action" yet choose to live by the adage
that "the word is not the thing" only: characters,
pixels, words, letters, efforts. e-nuf railing. 
capitals are simply not selected
by choice.

The crow crosses the street<br>
walking.
<p>On a power-cut night<br>
only the sound of<br>
rain.
<p>Their feet slip and slide on the mosaic floor<br>
Two sparrows that have<br>

<p>The wind <br>
shuffles my hair <br>
I comb them again.

here for the season
<p>baby lifted high<br>
"got any secrets to tell?"<br>
next year's sunflower
<p>simple palmettos<br>
up-slice footfalls of forest<br>
green ray planted sun
<p>staying with good friends<br>
grass mat with star ties is mine<br>
wind is also mine

In sorrow's firm grasp<br>
I sleep untill a glimmer<br>
Of love grabs my eye

<i>The poet comments, "To my good friend, Douglas Dahl, on his birthday as he joins
me at fifty-one. By next year we will have weathered the highs and lows of eight
decades.
<p>
 I'll send you a new ribbon for your typewriter, just keep bringing forth that wonderful
poetry.  Doug's collected works are available from Vanity Press (I was able to find
several offered by Amazon.com)"</i>

Playing behind the flowers<br>

to look up the word<br>
and tell you the things I feel<br>
is impossible
<p>
The sad, white, flower...<br>
knowing about its purpose<br>
..lilies on a grave.

my language is limited<br>
to tell you of love

<i>The poet comments, "En m corto espaol,<br>
M lenguage es limitado<br>

it is much wiser<br>
to have friends to trust, rather<br>
than those who you can't.

The wind blows the trees<br>
Leaves rustle and fly away<br>
Empty branches sway
<p>Waves crash on the beach<br>
Sand washes down the wet slopes<br>
Sand pours out to sea

The stars are like dust<br>
on deep blue or black velvet<br>
so cold is the night.
<p>A blue butterfly<br>
flits from flower to flower.<br>
A new beginning?

With dappled shadows, <br>
the summer sunlight breaks through <br>
the leafy branches.
<p>Cold rushing waters --<br>
the winter is melting -- <br>
my heart overflows.
<p>The green mossy pool, <br>
once cold, dark and empty, <br>
now teems with tadpoles.
<p>See the flash of light?  <br>
Wings rise over the water... <br>
Its a flying fish!
<p>Light beaming upward... <br>
a cloud on the horizon... <br>
The new day is born!
<p>A king and his son <br>
went out walking this morning - <br>
Perhaps it was us.

Round leaves like gold coins -<br>
Sitting under the aspens <br>
I'm rich as a king.
<p>I'm all alone now, <br>
the snow crunching underfoot <br>
echoes your goodbye.
<p>The changing seasons<br>
in an unending circle, <br>
roll ever onward.
<p>The dewdrops sparkling <br>
on the sweet cherry blossoms, <br>
reflect the sunrise.
<p>The golden leaves, <br>
wafted by the autumn breeze  <br>
blanket the hilltop.

Spring is in the air<br>
A baby is on its way<br>
Dreamy days ahead

You'd think we'd be used<br>
To being seduced but we<br>
Still behave loosely.
<p>
<i>The poet comments, "These are called 'Sinking Skin.'"</i>
<p>Give me a home where<br>
Only nomads roam. I'll build<br>
You Rome in a day.
<p>Energy should be <br>
Good for something other than<br>
Burning wantonly.
<p>Inescapably<br>
Catering to popular <br>
Taste, T.V. lays waste.
<p>If I smell alright,<br>
Chances are I haven't been<br>
Sweating it tonight.
<p>Might be mutual.<br>
If it isn't, one of us<br>
Is unusual. 
<p>I sat there sated,<br>
Further gone by far than I<br>
Had contemplated.
<p>A unifying<br>
Factor falsely contracted<br>
A de facto gap.
<p>Firmly persuaded,<br>
The inveterate saviour<br>
Threw cash at the saved.
<p>Where has your getting<br>
And spending got us? Blessed if<br>
I know. Who is us?

<p>Are the doctors of<br>
Theology closer to<br>
God than you or me?
<p>Prevention may be<br>
Better than cure. It's also<br>
A tremendous bore.
<p>Fragments of portents<br>
Are meaningless without the<br>
Oracular whole.
<p>You don't get to be<br>
Mother Superior<br>
By being dreary.
<p>Having entered the<br>
Gates of hell, the first thing you<br>
Notice is the smell.

Faith into the cold waters<br>
Of atheism.
<p>Instant solutions<br>
Dissolve the future into<br>
Painless inertia.
<p>Petro-chemical<br>
Industries dominate East<br>
West relationships.
<p>Feathered caps are worn<br>
By warriors to denote<br>
Bird-like qualities.
<p>If you are trapped in<br>
Turmoil, try pouring oil on<br>
Your troubled waters.
