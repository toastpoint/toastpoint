<h3><a href=mailto:acebucoon@juno.com>Pookie</a> begins a Teen Detective
novel 03/25/99</h3>
Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?  
  She would find out who was out to get her and who had forced the decision for her to
be kicked off the team. 
She was no longer, Beverly the High School Cheerleader.  She was Beverly, 
Teen Detective.........
<p>
She tried everything in her might, she hid in lockers, in toilet stalls, behind
the bleacher.  She wore wigs and shades as she attended the football games. Anything
to catch 
even a whisper between the other girls.  She continued to stay away from her house
during her 
usual cheerleader practice time because she was not going to let her mom
find out she had been kicked off the team, until she knew who was the master mind
behind it. <p> As she waited in the bathroom stall, in the locker room, after practice 
on that dreadful Tuesday she was delighted to finally hear the girls mention her name.
She knew it was
time for her to find out who had done this dreadful deed.  As the conversation
continued she began to shake
and get very nervous.  After all of this drama she was ready.  Suzy said to Mary, "I
always knew Beverly
was not Cheerleader material. I mean after all have you ever seen her try to do the 
to get up to the top of that pyramid?  It is a joke!"
<p>
Beverly knew now, it was Suzy.
<p>
Then Mary said to Kaneesha, "Ya, if you think that is bad you should have seen her
practice her high 
kicks and her pom pom throws, it was disgusting."
<p>
Beverly was confused, she thought it was Suzy, but now Mary was in on it too.  
She thought to herself, what am I going to do it was a conspiracy!! I can't
very well get back at the whole darn cheerleader team!  She began to cry silently as 
she imagined telling her mother that she got kicked off the team beacause evryone of
those
girls conspired against her.
<p>
Just as she began to get some toilet paper to wipe her tears, she heard Kaneesha
say to both Mary and Suzy, "Hey you two, she may not have been all that great, but 
we are Juniors and she is only a freshman.  If I remember right, both of you got cut
from the team 
as Freshmen, because you were not so great yet!  Maybe you need to think about that
and watch out, because if 
she does some practicing over the summer and comes back again next year, she might
just come back and make the both of you look
REAL bad!"
<p>
Just as Kaneesha finished talking a huge crash came from one of the far bathroom
stalls.  They were all
very startled and just looked to see what would come of the noise they had heard.
Moments later out cam a very
flustered Beverly, with a some tissue in her hand and a wet sneaker.  She
had fallen in the toilet as she imagined herself coming back next year and 
showing that stuck up Mary and Suzy just what she had to give!  They all looked
suprised
but as Beverly began walking towards them she held out her hand.  She walked up to
Kaneesha and
shook her hand.  As she continued to walk out of the room she said, "Well girls, you
better watch
out, because I am coming back next year, I am going to be better and I am going to 
give the both of you a run for your money.  Oh, by the way, Kaneesha maybe you and
I can get together this summer and do some practicing!"
<p>
She left school on that day feeling better about herself, knowing that she had it
in her, but she just had to keep working at it.  She went home that night and told her
mother 
all about what she had done for the last week and that she had been cut from the team.
Her mother just looked at her and said, "Beverly, you can do anything you put your
mind to.
I will look forward to going to watch all of those football games next year, because I
know
you will be out there doing your best!"

<h3>The Coz begins a Coming of Age novel 03/24/99</h3>
<a href=crabs.jpg><img src=crabthb.gif alt="Crab Family" align="left"></a>
<img src="../gifs/star3.gif" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">

        Kids for some reason reach that terrible period where they are too old to be 
babied on family vacations and are too young to move out. The standard for this 
age group is ten through twenty-two. Most kids would rather be left home 
than go on vacation; it is a natural function of life, yet, for some 
inexpicable reason parents just don't get it. Brandon and Carrie were no 
exception.<p>
        "Why do we have to hold lobsters, Mom?" asked Carrie. "Because it's a family 
photo that we'll be able to cherish forever, so shut up and smile" was Mary's
heated response. Mary was the mother. She and her asshole husband broke up 
two years after the birth of their first child, Carrie, and only six months before 
the birth of Brandon, the second and obviously last child to come from the Fantons.
<p>        The two kids were driving Mary nuts since vacation began two days 
ago. In truth, they had been driving her nuts since day one. They slept less 
than an old insomiac, ran around all day and mangaged to destroy, or at least 
knock over, everything in the house on a daily basis. They were driving her nuts.
   <p>     "They're crabs, not lobsters, stupid." That was little Brandon. 
At age six he was already reading at a third grade level. He was sharp,
all right, but he was so mean to his sister. The sentiment was returned from 
Carrie, who often gave poor Brandon haircuts in the middle of the night. That 
drove Mary nuts.
<p>        "I remember when my girl got crabs. Boy, did they itch. I remember 
back in the twenties, or roaring twenties as they were called in those days...
I guess they weren't so roaring compared to nowadays, anyway, she was a real 
peach, I mean a Georgia Peach, not some rotten peach that I used to get on
the corner of Fifth and Frenmont, that's where I grew up, on the South side of San 
Mateo...
   <p>     "Mommy, who's the crazy old man? He won't shut up," Carrie whined.
Whoever he was, he recalling his early days before the war, whichever one that was.
Mary was annoyed, but she wanted to hear about the crabs.
      <p>  "Mom, can we please take the picture? I want to go home! Now!" 
Brandon began to jump up and down in a tantrum that Mary knew all too well.
"Hold on, sweetheart. Mommy just has get the crazy old man out of the shot.
"What was her name? Her name rhymed with something my Grandmother used to 
make..."<p>
Carrie howled "Mom! Tell Brandon to shut up! He's being a butthead!"<p>
"Don't call your brother a butthead."<p>
"Yeah, doofuss, don't call me a butthead!" <p>
"Both of you shut up right this instant! I want you two to apologize 
and smile. Excuse me, sir, could you please step aside while I take a 
picture?"<p>
        But he was ignoring her. He kept right on talking about his 
grandmother on the farm and how his old girlfriend's name rhymed with something. 
Leather? Heather? Balogna? Toni? Asparagus? What rhymes with asparagus? I think 
that's the word. And so on. He was driving Mary nuts.
<p>        The kids had since then made up and ran off in other directions.
<p>"You're it!"
<p>"No, you're it!"
<p>"No I'm not, butthead!"<p>
"Yeah you are, butthead!"<p>
"Am not!"<p>
"Are too!"<p>
Beside Mary: "Gus? Hus" Struss? Maybe it was Gus?"<p>
"Shut up!"<p>
The childrens' voices had reached ultrasonic by this point. Mary could feel the 
tension piling, the familiar pulsating in her neck. <p>
"That's it you little monsters. Get your little behinds over here now so we 
can take a picture. Neither of you are it! Now get over here!"<p>
"Or was it Amanda?"<p>
Mary whirled on the old man.  "Who are you, anyway? Get out of here!Get away 
from me you old bat! You're really beginning to fuckin' piss me off!"<p>
        The children froze. Once they had heard their mother swear, but she had said 
damn, but on the totem pole of swearing, that was pretty low. But they had
never, ever heard her say that word, the king of all swear words, the word 
that they, as old and as grown up as they thought they were, would never dream 
of saying that word for fear of death. <p>
        Mary noticed that the children had stopped, and so had the old 
man. He just stood there with a frightened look on his face. <p>
        "I'm... I'm sorry" she heard herself say with a stutter. 
"I... I didn't mean to yell. I just lost it for a second." She calmed herself
and breathed deeply. The look on her children's faces sent a pang of guilt
down her belly.<p>
        "Kids, let's just take a picture, okay? Then we can go home."<p>
"You don't have to yell at the old man, mommy" Brandon said gently.<p>
"I'm sorry, sweetheart." She looked at the old man.  
        "Would you like to be in the picture, sir?"<p>
The old man paused. "If it doesn't bother you any" he said sheepishly.<p>
        Mary gathered herself and positioned the kids and the old man, each with a 
crab in hand.<p>
On three; one, two...<p>
"I got it! Jelly! Jelly and Kelly!"<p>
Mary had to smile. Even after such a tense moment the old man and the kids 
had forgotten all about it. They lived each moment independently, no regrets.
She wished she could do the same.<p>
"Three."

<h3><a href=mailto:wgwells@flash.net>Hard-Boiled Executive</a> begins a Mystery
novel 03/22/99</h3>
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.<p>
  "Yeah?" I spewed. "And? So?"<p>
Seemingly nonplussed by my nonplussedness, Gia swaggered over to the desk, flipping her
swishy dress in
a belligerent yet strangely seductive manuever that sent my heart skipping around the room.
"Yeah?" she mimicked me back. "Hey, I'm sure I'm the best looking dame you've ever laid
those dreamy emerald jewels you call eyes on!  
"Show some respect to my beauty. You should be panting like a cartoon dog."<p>
"Yes," I admitted ruefully, "You're right. You come in here and drop a gator on my desk
and I should be panting. Panting like a fox!"<p>
"I don't understand," she said quizzically.<p>
Of course, I didn't understand either. Not that I would admit it to her! But I did know one
thing. Man, was that gator smelling up the place, and I don't mean in a rich, heady bouqet
sense either. I mean, this broad 
had just funked up my desk, funked up my office, and before I got through with her, I'm
sure she would, with extreme prejudice, funk up my life.

<h3><a href=mailto:glennefer@ncweb.com>Michelle Elaine Mononen</a> begins a fuzzy blend of applesauce and oatmeal socks novel 03/21/99</h3>
Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?<p>
  She couldn't.  Beverly chewed on the handle of her pom-pom, and after careful
consideration, decided that the only way she could continue her now shameful existance was
to move in with her best friend Kitty, change her name, dye her hair black, and speak with a
British accent.  <p>
            Britania Stewert was sitting at the "geek" table during lunch.  <p>
             "Ple-ayse poss me a nappe," she asked one of the geeks.<p>
             The geek offered her a crumpled, crusty kleenex and said in the traditional geeky
sounding voice, "Are you from Wales? I detect a hint of Walish in your vocalizations."<p>
                  She glared at the geek and snarled, "Git awa frumme me."<p>

<h3><a href=mailto:matthew@atlantic.net>Sir Orrin Hacklesbury</a> begins a Edwardian
Pap novel 03/18/99</h3>
<img src="../gifs/star3.gif" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
     "Aloysius, do close your gob," warbled Lady Julia, plucking imaginary dust off her
brocade.  The tea had been served late, if you could call the weedy leaves (which smelled
suspiciously like the ornamental lawn cabbage she only yesterday noticed missing from the
Victoria rose garden) they served during rationing time <i>tea</i>.  Lady Julia felt a
headache coming on.  "You carry on so, you're likely to be mistaken for a open post box
into which Jenkins is liable to shove the evening <i>Times</i>.  Really, do come round,
won't you?" she wheedled impotently.<p>
     Aloysius swiveled his heavy head around to look at his sister, missing the mark by a few
inches, forcing him to over-correct his pickled gaze, like the Edsel rounding a tight curve on
their ash-lined driveway, with the right tires significantly flatter than the left ones.  "Wash the
matter with pecan sauce?" came the slow, thickened speech.  "'Ere, 'aven't you ever heard
of going native?" He lowered his voice slightly.  "Bloody tonkers, trying stop progressh.  It's
enough to make a deshent man into a dirigb...dirigle...diri...into a balloon, by bloody jingo.
'I will show you fear in a handfull of dusht,'" he mumbled.  He took a deep, uncertain breath,
and shouted, "Where in knickers sake is my sherry!?"  With a final hiccough, Aloysius' head
finally dropped into his plate of kippers and orange marmalade with a thud that rattled the
china and overturned a glass of currant juice.  Flecks of plaster, disturbed from their slow,
mouldering rest, gently wafted downward like an
 early snow, coming to a peaceful rest in Aloysius' hair.<p>
     "Aloysius," she choked, stricken.  "I could simply vomit!" she spat, swallowing every
unstressed syllable of her perfect trochaic trimeter.  "Vomit!!" she wailed.<p>
     And she did.

<h3><a href=mailto:Bobcat93@hotmail.com>Bobcat</a> begins a Fantasy
novel 03/15/99</h3>
The creature moved slowly over the grey stones of the castle wall keeping to
the shadows and the darkness that would hide its hideous form.  It moved
quietly and softly for all its great bulk careful not to make the slightest sound
that would give its position away.  The eyes of the creature moved as well,
looking and seeking the smallest movement the hint of a changing shadow or
shape.  It did not wish to be detected and feared discovery above all else.
So, it crept with pain staking slowness being carefull not to make the slightest
noise making its way to the doorway that stood directly ahead open as if
inviting the creature inside.<p>   As the creature came abreast of the doorway it's
ears picked up the sound of a soft crying coming from inside.  The cry came
from the mouth of a small child and it was because of this child that the
creature was here.  It was as if a hand had reached out and grabbed the
creature physically pulling it through the doorway towards the sound of the crying child.  As the creature came through the doorway the crying grew
louder and the creature was drawn to the back of the room.  The creature
focused its eyes and there in the corner was the child that it had sought for so
long.  The child of prophecy.

<h3><a href=mailto:Iceblade@ascended.com>Ice Blade</a> begins a Science Fiction
novel 03/09/99</h3>
It's not what he had expected, the structure was so huge inside that the echos seemed to
have echos.
<p>
With awe drawn on his face he entered in not noticing the cracking marks he made on
the dust layered floor. Reading about these had been one thing but to stand in one.
<p>
'A lost space temple' as many people liked to call them. Structures that were built for
people to live in, all plans and maps of them lost in the wars that followed. Such a
mystery that man would ever need to move from the lush planets he lived on. Burnt
books told tales of men living in tiny ships for weeks seeking other planets to live on. Yet
no one knew how the groups banded together and managed to build such great floating
cities.
<p>
Only two had been found but broken records showed over fifty, where were the rest ?
Why was this one only an empty platform when the other two were full ghost towns ?
Who gave them the plans and materials for the space domes ?
<p>
"Too many questions ..." Colbin shook his head to clear it a bit and tryed to examin one
of the fine carvings on a support beams, "... I wonder what material this is made of ?"
<p>
A creak behind him made him spin around with his torch darting over the eery scene.
<p>
"Empty ... sure I heard some thing." He almost stuttered with fear in his thoughts.
<p>
Sure enough the platform was only supporting him, this was the first time he had ever
knew that one had made a noise. But the shape of the whole structure was diffrent than
the other two, more oblong.
<p>
"More like a huge ..." stumbled back into the support beam trying to take in the whole
scene with his flash light beam, "... space ship."
<p>
<I>The author comments,</I> "Unfinished ... this is a full short story in the making :) I'll

<h3>Summer Rain begins a  novel 03/08/99</h3>
<img src="../gifs/star3.gif" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?<p>
  It wasn't her fault she'd slipped on that puddle of Mr. Pibb. True she shouldn't
have been drinking there in the middle of the gymnasium during practise, but the 
coach had been late and like every other day she had skipped lunch so that she could 
work on her science project. An ingenious invention really. She had worked diligently
for 
weeks now and was almost finished. She'd been doing some last minute calculations in
her head
and must have absentmindedly spilled the pop. It had to be then or the next moment
when Shiela
had stumbled into her from behind. It wouldn't surprise her if one of the other girls had
pushed Shiela
into her on purpose. They all had it in for her, never liking her ever since she'd made
captain and not one
of them. The "popular" crowd. The "elite", with their fake nails and false smiles.
Surprising that none of the boys on the 
basketball team had ever been blinded by their dazzling irredescent caps. They thought
they had it so rough, the "preppies".
Yeah, it must be soooo hard deciding what to wear the next day and who to be seen
with so they would be invited somewhere trendy or to 
some lame party. There was only so much pizza and pop a person could endure, I
thought. And four years of the same ritual Friday and Saturday night
seemed a waste of a golden opportunity to discover the relationship of bee pollen and
tree sap when immersed with high grade fructose.
Which brought me back to my immediate issue of slipping on soda during practice and
endangering the lives of the team members, most specifically Angela, the current top
to our latest attempt at a new pyramid idea. If we mastered it we would no doubt shine
at the National Cheerleading Competition, but my clumsiness would get us laughed off
the stage.<p>
We'd no doubt go down in history as the best in our field for blunders. Maybe we could
get a t.v. deal with bloopers and practical jokes, that is if I didn't kill anyone.
It seemed unfair to me that I had been stripped of my captainhood because of a human
error, but I had been negligent in my responsibilities to uphold a safe working
environment, and my
professionalism was in question. Still, Coach Brady could have let me stay on the team.
She was friends with my mother. She knew this would kill her, and I'd never hear the
end of it. "Lydia! After
all I do for you! THis is not the way I raised you young lady! Now how will you ever fit
in, and when will a boy take notice of you now? You'll never get a date for prom and
you'll never get a steady boyfriend and get married.
I'll never have grand-children and I'll be old and alone and you'll be in some 3rd world
country trying to grow food with glucose and cure ailments with that weird jello
conglomeration that is still growing in the 'fridge!"
Ugh I could just imagine. She'd probably start crying and call Coach Brady complaining
to her about my "strangeness". Mom would beg coach to give me another chance and I'd
be forced to accompany her to bingo or something equally
as horrible, like tupperware parties or makeovers. This thought made me cry out in
anguish and I considered what it would be like to live the rest of my teenage years under
the dusty bleachers. Cramped and confining,I knew. <p>
I'd probably starve to death unless I broke into the cafeteria late at night after the
custodian went home. I was not looking forward to my life as a hermit. I could still show
my face after all. Sure the kids might tease me for a while, but after I won the award at
the
science fair I would be in my element. The world would be at my feet. I would be queen
and they.....they wouldn't be elite anymore. I'd exile all the mean people who had ever
bullied me and every cheerleader except the ones who bought my newest invention. 
Gravitational gum.  I'd worked out the properties and added natural ingredients for flavor.
The sugar based compound would generate millions and I'd buy the school and fire
Coach Brady. I'd send my mom to one of those 3rd world countries and fund an
orphanage for her there. <p>
She could have as many "grandchildren" as she could handle. Me, I'd be free. I'd be
flying. And I wouldn't be a cheerleader anymore because I didn't want to be one. If it
had been up to me I never would have tried out in the first place. After all...the Laker
girls looked okay to me in their tight shorts ...in their world, but in my opinion
one man had them all beat with the use of only a single muscle. And no matter how
attractive the population thought those women to be, I believed this man was a million
times sexier. I'd lived my whole life wanting to follow in the footsteps of this great
intellectual, and my first step was saying good bye to the regimented world of beauty
queens and
hello to the potentials of human possibilities. Mind over matter was all I had to
remember. Hopefully I wouldn't slip this time. As I crawled out from my hiding place I
sneezed and wiped the cobwebs from my clothes, willing the spirit of Einstein to guide
me with the right conversions so that I might become a legend in my own time.

He had eagerly anticipated this moment for many years now. His grandfather had been a
fisherman specializing in shellfish. He would visit with him at his tent and gaze with
incomplete understanding at the collection of live creatures to be purchased, cooked and
eaten. He had eaten of his grandfather's shop before and each time was more delectable
than the last. He grandfather was not only a fisherman but an excellent cook. He sucked
the meat off of the legs of any crustacean afforded him and licked clean the shells of
mussels and oysters. Yet today was the day he waited for. There was something in the
moment of catching that he saw in grandpa's eyes but good never grasp. Now today
with his sister he would know that feeling, that sensation which had so engrossed his
grandpa that would make the old man say, "Fishing is good." For the first time in his life
he held it, he smelled it and knew. The hair on his neck stiffens. His hands trembled and
a cold sweat ran down his brow. Nothing would ever compare to the day when he caught his first crab.

Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming
