"Well," Inspector Andrew Clue said with deep deliberation, "the post mortem
revealed that how the Native American victim died was from being force-fed
massive amounts of Bran Flakes. Obviously it was the work of a cereal
killer. The body was found in one of his tepees; therefore, I've concluded,
with some reservation, that his suffering was intense."<p>
        "What was the victim's occupation?" asked the inspector's eager
young apprentice who heretofore hadn't had A. Clue to guide him, "And what
was the motive?"<p>
        "He was a masseuse," answered the inspector, stroking his chin. "He
probably rubbed someone the wrong way."

As Flammie politely took a fig newton between her carefully lacquered Lee
Press-on nails and, mindful of smearing her lipstick, delicately bit into
it, she murmured a breathy "Thank y'all" that  set Bertie's heart aflutter
with anticipation.<p>
        "Ms. Flaker, you're just the woman I've been searching for. I find
the sound of your voice very exciting!" he said, with what Flammie assumed
was desire - as indeed it was, but not quite the kind she imagined. "Wait
right here until I get what I need from the bedroom."<p>
        While thoughts of  seduction, conversion, sainthood, and fame
inflamed Flammie's brain, Bertie searched frantically for his tape recorder
and a few fresh cassettes. Flammie was indeed what he needed to launch his
study of the region's peculiar dialect, the better to prepare himself to
write the definitive study of what he'd taken the liberty of calling
"Hillbonics: The Grammar, Syntax, Vocabulary, and Pronunciation of West
Virginia Dialectical Variations as a Subset and/or Digression of the
Standard English Vernacular," the publication of which would establish his
integrity as a linguist, guarantee his appointment to a full professorship
at a prestigious Ivy League College, and impress his older brother who -as a
successful used-car salesman - was forever belittling Bertie's academic
interests.<p>
        As Flammie waited, her patience giving way to nervousness when
Bertie seemed to be taking an inordinate amount of time in the bedroom, she
ate the rest of the fig newtons and contemplated how best to begin the
seduction.  After unbuttoning the top three buttons of her blouse and
kicking off her shoes, she struck what she believed was a provocative pose
in the open doorway, the better for the sunlight to glint off her artfully
lacquered curls.<p>
        At that moment, Bertie - clutching his recorder - emerged from the
bedroom, gaped in Flammie's direction, and muttered, "Omigod!" with what
Flammie assumed was wild desire, but what was in reality a warning to
Flammie to move aside as an enormous hog raced across the porch and toward
the open door.  Not heeding the warning - indeed, not knowing it was a warning
to be heeded - Flammie was struck full force from behind by the desperate
Petunia and knocked into Bertie, who fell beneath Flammie as Petunia
galloped over them both and sought refuge under the bed.  When Flammie came
to, confused though she was, she was certain the earth had moved.  Seeing
Bertie beneath her, she thoughtfully asked, "Was it good for y'all, too?"
but Bertie, still unconscious, was not the one who replied, "In God's name,
Flammie, what have you done?!"<p>
        Flem, who had just now arrived with Sofie Mae and was already upset
about the pig poop damage to his upholstery, couldn't believe his eyes!
<p>

"Ah kin explain ever'thing, Flem honey," said Flammie, which she then
proceeded to do while Flem, pretending to listen, kept his eyes on Sophie
Mae who-Flem could see through the open bedroom door- was bent over trying
to coax Petunia out from under Bertie's bed, and Flem uttered an occasional
"Oh, God!" as he watched her up-turned derriere.
<p>
Meanwhile, perched on his deer stand back on Widow's Peak, Samuel M.
("Slam") Dunkin watched his brother Kix pilot the patrol car down the
precipitous  mountain road and reflected that his brother had all the
luck-an exciting job, a nice car that he didn't even have to make payments
on, and the affections of the widow Marvella Maypole. Slam, whose life had
been plagued by series of bad luck incidents, had never gotten over being
fired from his job as basketball coach by the Widow's Peak school board who
wanted to use the money they'd save by firing him to hire a math teacher.
Slam had tried to explain that most of the kids would never even have any
need for math-not having any money to count-but they'd always play
basketball, but the school board just wouldn't listen to reason. He still
bore a grudge against all the surviving members of the board-too bad about
Maynard Maypole's mysterious cave-in accident, Slam chuckled to himself-and
always kept his deer rifle loaded just in case he ran across any of the
rest of them.
<p>
Just then, Slam heard-or thought he heard-something crashing through the
trees on the north side of the peak. Suddenly, he recalled the stories Kix
used to tell him about the Peak's Pike, a giant ghost fish with a taste for
human flesh, that was rumored to rise from the lake and scale the peak
while looking for its next victim. Slam tried vainly to dismiss the image
from his mind-as a child, he always used to wet the bed when Kix told him
those stories long ago-but the tell-tale dampness creeping down his legs
told him that some things cannot be so easily dismissed.

<h3><a href=mailto:marksmeb@sprynet.com>Emmy Barks</a> <a name="cliche">begins</a> a Slice o' Life novel 02/05/97</h3>
  Standing on the very edge of the office building, feeling the warm breeze
against his face, he thought about his life, or the lack of his life. The lack
of living, of really enjoying anything.  He was twenty-two, and as far as he
could remember there was so little in life that he really cared to remember.
He thought about the time his dad had brought him a present all the way from
France. It was a book about the Grand Louvre Museum. He'd loved that book and
worn it completely out by the time he was twelve. There were the most
fascinating pictures in that book. He still couldn't figure out why his brother
decided to tear out each page and use it to fold poorly-made paper airplanes.
<p>
  He looked down over the edge of the building. There were small things moving
around down there, Cars, people and the like.
<p>
  And the time his sister told his one and only girlfriend that he still wet
the bed on occasion. She wouldn't even look at him at school the next day and
he knew it was over. Too bad she was the only girl he had ever really cared
for. Life had been cruel to him and he really couldn't see continuing it.
<p>
  He chanced another peek. Man, it was a long way down. The breeze up here
was getting a little stronger now.
