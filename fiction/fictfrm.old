<h3>First Line?</h3>
<br>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Zog">
Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Jezebel">
Although grandly appelled Fortescue Manor by its original owners, the 
townspeople still referred to the aging structure as Jezebel's Den, 
although the tragic events therein had reached their conclusion decades earlier.
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Gia">
I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Monique">
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Beverly">
Beverly, huddled under the bleachers, sniffed back a tear.  Kicked off the 
cheerleading squad!  All of her mother's dreams for her, dashed!  How could she 
even go home now?
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="Zinnia">
"But really, Bartholomew" laughed Lady Zinnia with her characteristic 
throaty chuckle, "You can't be serious!  Lady Thanninger, with that 
dashing young... oh, no, it can't be.  He's simply too <em>common</em> for someone of her station!"
<p>
<input type="radio" name="firstline" value="mine">
Wanna do my own first line.
