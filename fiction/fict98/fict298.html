<h3><a href=mailto:rgziemer@worldnet.att.net>Space Cowboy</a> begins a Mysterious Science Fiction Adventure 02/26/98</h3>
   It was a warm summers night.  As I do sometimes, I was driving aimlessly.  
I lived in a railroad town, and on nights like this, the long freight 
trains rumbled through regularly.  It was easier to drive my self tired,
and sleep in the truck under the overpass, than to try and sleep in bed.
Sometimes I went off-roading, but mostly I just kicked my recovery equipment aside
to get more room to stretch out.<p>
   I drive a fullsize '83 Jimmy I call James, and there is something relaxing 
about the distant burble of my exhaust.  Or maybe it's the carbon monoxide
seeping through the floorboards.  At any rate, I wasn't the brightest bulb on
the block that night.  That is why I pulled over when a pretty girl waved 
me down, out on a lonely stretch of route 38.  I didn't have any idea what 
I would do when she got in, and it was just as well.<p>
  "Need a ride?" I said as she hopped in.  She just smiled at me.  She was kind
of pretty in a nerdish way.  Then she said "Take me to the Fredricks Research 
Center".  I shrugged. It was all the same to me.  I made a u turn, and headed off the way I came,
towards the lab.  It was not far away, and this all sounded interesting to me.
I wasn't quite as tired as I was before.  "Ya start work late there?" I said.
"Kind of," was all she said.  I took my eyes from the road for a second and
looked at her real hard.  She looked nervous.  That made me nervous too.  <p>
   "It must be a drag to work late like this." I said.  This provoked no 
response from her.  I had a bad feeling about all of this, and I suddenly 
wanted to get to the bottom of it.  "Boss giving you hassle at work?"  I asked.
"I'm gonna kill him." she whispered.  I nodded my head.  I knew the feeling.<p>
   We wheeled into the main entrance, and I pulled up to the guard house.  The
guard walked up as I rolled down the window.  The girl looked real nervous now.
She handed me her ID card, which I handed to the guard.  He glanced at it, 
and looked at me.<p>
   "You know that visitors are not allowed after five, Mindy." the guard said.
I didn't like that at all.  By now, I was quite ready to be done with all of
this, and go home.<p>
   "Oh, Sam, this is my boyfriend." she said, and the guard looked at me.
I shook my head to the negative, and smiled at him.  He reached inside the 
guardhouse towards a phone on the wall.  I could tell it was time to leave.<p>
   "Aww, too bad Mindy...You can show me the office some other time," I 
said as I turned towards her.  A deafening BOOOMM filled my truck, and I 
saw the guard knocked inside the shack.  I felt paralyzed, and turned towards
this Mindy creature.  She held a Glock 9mm.  I looked back at the fallen guard,
who was groaning and crawling into the guard shack.  The passenger side 
door slammed, and I saw her run around the back of the truck.  I felt like
events had long since left me behind, and so I just jammed the truck into gear, 
and started pulling away.  Then my new friend Mindy grapped at me thru the window.  
I opened the door into her, hard.  She fell down, and I swung the truck around 
the guard shack.  CRASH went the vent window next to me, and then I couldn't 
see.  I pointed the truck where I thought the road was, and hit the gas.  That 
lasted about 3 seconds, and I felt it hit something.  The engine stalled.  
I wiped my own blood from my eyes, and saw that I had run up against a row
of saplings.  I started the engine again, and put it in reverse.  Then I felt 
the door open, and I was suddenly on my side in the grass.  Mindy was climbing in
my truck.  No way!  I jumped at the door, but she had locked it.  I slid open the side
window in back, and was reaching for the door lock, when the door opened.  Mindy 
removed herself, and pointed the gun at my chest.  I stopped moving.<p>
   "Drive.  I, uh... can't drive a manual."  I just stared at her.  I felt a
laugh coming on.  She waved the gun at me, and instead I climbed in.  She got 
in the other side, and we started down the service road.<p>
   I accelerated, and as we rounded a bend in the road, I saw a small 
bunker shaped building.  I pointed the truck towards it, and at the same time,
I reached over and hit the release button on her seatbelt.  She saw what I 
did, and she dropped the gun.  Now she was trying to get the belt into the hole, 
and I hit the side of the bunker.  The truck smashed through the wall, 
and she hit the dashboard.  The front of the truck fell about 3 feet, and the whole
thing came to a grinding halt.  I saw a maze of conduit and pipe over my crumpled
hood.  A klaxon was blaring somewhere.  The girl was on the floor of the 
truck, and all I wanted to do was open the door and get out.  Then 
something shifted, and I felt the truck slide foreward.  I would have
liked to yell, but I just looked on in stunned silence as the truck started
to fall.  Then there was a loud noise, a lot of light, and the smell of ozone.
Then black.  <p>
   I felt for the flashlight I keep in the center console.  Found 
it.  I flipped it on.  The truck was more or less level, and the girl was 
still on the floor.  I reached over, and retrieved the pistol.  Then I climbed out.
The James was pretty messed up in front.  It looked like it had busted the radiator
open.  Fluid poured out over the bumper.  The flashlight revealed a grove of 
trees, and beyond, a moonlit field.<p>
   I stumbled over some bushes, and out into the open.  I'd say the field 
was at least a couple miles wide, but there was a building of some kind in 
the distance. <p>
   I walked back to the James, and forced the mangled hood open.  It wasn't 
as bad as I thought.  The fenders and hood were all bent up, but my homemade 
grill guard had done a good job of keeping the vitals safe.  I had been leaking
only windshield washer fluid.  I opened the passenger door with difficulty, and 
checked on my passenger.  It looked as if she was just knocked out, but I
figured I better take her to the hospital.  Or maybe the police.  I started the 
truck, put it in four wheel drive, and bounced through the brush into the 
clearing.  All the lights were broken in front but for a single fog light.  
I drove across the field slowly, not wanting to puncture a tire on an old box
spring in the weeds, or something.  After a couple minutes, I arrived at the 
building, which actually was a way station of some kind along the railroad tracks.
I left the truck running, and ran to the front door.  It was locked, and I couldn't see 
a payphone or anything.  I stood on the platform by the tracks, and looked, but I 
couldn't see any buildings in the distance.  I had no idea where I was.  Figured 
I had been in some kind explosion, but where was the research center?  <p>
   I saw a light way down the track.  Good, I thought, I'll have the engineer radio
for a cop or something.  I headed back to the truck, and waited.  The light 
drew closer.  And closer.  When the train was within half a mile or so, I jumped out.
i ran to the tracks, and waved my flaslight around, hoping he'd stop.  Then I saw that 
it was an old steam locomotive.  Bogus.  No radio in that.  It drew to a screeching
halt, steam blasting everywhere, and the engineer climbed down onto the platform I was on.
 I recalled that Railroad Days, which was just an excuse to show off antique trains, 
and have a parade, was just around the corner.  I walked to meet the engineer.  <p>
   "Morning," I said.  "Is there a phone here?  I have a girl in my truck, and she's hurt.
She's hurt.  I was wondering if you could call for an ambulance, or something."<p>
   The man just stared at me.  "Can you call a doctor for me?" I reiterated.  He nodded, 
and shooed me towards the door.  He kept looking at the jimmy.  He unlocked the door, 
and we entered.  He pointed at a telegraph setup on a counter.  "Is thet there
what yer lookin fer, son?"  I started laughing, and looked around.  This guy didn't
seem to appreciate the growing urgency of this situation.  I spied a calender on the 
desk.  It said September of 1870.  I felt a little faint.  The man was talking at me.
"...thang you got outside?  One of those new John Deere's?  How'd they git 
a steam engine in that li'l thang?"  I jumped up, and started looking at the things in
the room.  It couldn't be.  Impossible.  I saw a scedule on the wall.  I looked 
at a wind up clock, and saw that my wrist watch was correct.  It was about
3 in the morning.  I looked outside.  A flickering gaslight illuminated the steaming 
locomotive's ID numbers.  1157.  I looked at the schedule, and found that if today was
indeed the 6th, then train 1157 was on time.  I asked the guy point blank.
"What's the date?"<p>
   "Well, like yer calender sez, it's the 6th of september." he said.
   "What year?" I asked, breathlessly.<p>
   "1870." he said, looking at me funny.

It was a dark and somewhat languid, just perfect for the exchange, John Loundes, formally of Florida, and currently residing in Philadelphia, thought. The tires on the automobiles passing made a shoosh-shoosh-pshssss sound as they navigated the tarmack. John was waiting by the drop point, 
a copy of the Philadelphia Inquirer rolled under his arm, a baloney sandwich with mustard, lettuce and cous-cous in the other. His favorite. He had to eat sometime and he knew the timing of the drop was critical. The document he would pass to his contact was rolled carefully in the cous-cous. How ingenious, he thought.
He allowed himself to daydream, briefly. It was late, too late to call his old sometimes-on sometimes-off flame, Mitzi. Quite a package, he thought, squeezing the sandwich with a deep longing. Ah Mitzi. Few men know the pleasure of a professional clown's company; fewer still, he mused, ever enjoyed
the physical nature of their relationship; the seltzer bottle spray in the face, the red rubber honking nose, the big feet. And there was Mitzi's contributions as well.

<h3><a href=mailto:PDLuebke@worldnet.att.net>Deb Bass</a> begins a Tall Tale novel 02/23/98</h3>
They were a basic kind of couple, they saved all their spare change in a jar  on top of the refrigerator, and never really went far, just far enough to visit the kids 2 hours away by country backroads.  Gert was simple.  She hung her laundry out in the winter to dry, although it would freeze solid until about 2:00 p.m. when the moisture had had a chance to evaporate, kind of the way ice cubes will shrink in the freezer.  Albert was German descent and so his father told him, that his grandpapa came over on the boat and only knew two words in English, doughnut and hello.  Presently we join Albert and Gert, who have been married for 44 years.  Remember all the change on top of the refrigerator?  Well Gert stopped at the bank to do the deposit and discovered $44,000.00 in their savings.  Sneakily she stole away to the  travel agent next door to book 2 flights to Germany.  A surprise for Albert for  his 62nd birthday.  "Won't he be surprised!" thought Gert, as she floated home with!
 her 2 tickets for the flight overseas.  
She could hardly wait to show Albert their passport to a new adventure.  
Dressed in Lederhosen, here the happy couple <a href=tyrol.jpg>poses for the camera</a> in front of the airport.

"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," Clem thought as she toked
another hit from the clove cigarette that dangled between the second two 
fingers of her left hand like some long cylindrical thing between two other 
cylindrical things.  A tremendous wind suddenly blew open the latticed bay
windows, sending the torn lace curtains fluttering like the voice of a 
schoolboy on his first trip to the whorehouse.<p>
Physically, she was an average woman.  I later learned that she was a genius, a champion
chess player who smoked 32 Camel Lights per day.  But her mathematical acumen
did nothing for her flattened features, nor did they sooth the timber of 
her speaking voice.  She had the grace of a screeching hare-lipped chicken whose
face had been repeatedly beaten by the farmer's sadistic, pesticide-poisoned
child, and a series of personalities to match.  A rare disorder of the 
sebaceous gland gave her a pungent, mildewy odor that she could not detect 
through the damage that her incessant smoking wreaked upon her sinuses.

<p>
"I need help, Mr. Trowel," she cooed, perching herself on the edge of my desk.  I had a view of her right leg that went all the way to San Fran and back. "What can I do for you," I barked, testily. The shoe-in-training started lunching on my Luger, and I flipped him into the trash can for safekeeping.

"I'm in a tight place, Mr. Trowel," she trilled. "That alligator is my ticket to the big time, but someone's been trying to steal him. I need you to keep him safe."

constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as

<h3>A Close Call</h3>

<img src=../../gifs/star3.gif align="right" alt="Gold Star!">
The Twins frolicked for the duration of their Sock Hop, all the while
brimming with eagerness to race back to the Official Parkey Twin Mystery
Solving Nerve Center to eavesdrop on the activities of the sinister
stranger.
<p>
Meanwhile, though, Pansy got to show Patsy a few dance moves she learned
when her mother lived in New York for a short duration and was an understudy
for "A Chorus Line."  Pretty soon, Patsy was Shagging with the best of them,
and even doing a little Breakdancing.
<p>
Patsy, for her part, enjoyed showing Pansy a few of her own moves when Pansy
found herself cornered by resident oaf, bully, and hormonal wild-child,
Egbert -- known as "the Cruncher" to his victims and those that lived in
fear of him.  Cruncher threatened to stick his hand up Pansy's summer angora
sweater, but was quickly felled by Patsy's swift blows to his kidney, groin,
and neck.
<p>
"Wow, Patsy!" cried Pansy joyously, "You're the best twin a sister could
have! Teach me how to do that, oh, please?"
<p>
"Aww, Pansy, it's nothing.  I only wish I could moonwalk as well as you,"
she replied, somewhat miffed when she realized she had caught a small thread
from Sir Frou-Frou on her nail.  "Remind me to show you how to kill a masher
with a pencil sometime."
<p>
The rest of the party carried on without incident.
<p>
The twins finally got back to their crime-fighting headquarters and flicked
on their Official Parkey Twins Crimefighting and Espionage Radio Snooper.
They were mildly disappointed to hear silence, broken only occasionally by
the shuffling of some papers.
<p>
"He must be alone," said Pansy, disappointed.  "In an office, or something."
Her corn-curls drooped ever so slightly.
<p>
"Patience, Pans! We can still pick up clues; we just hafta be extra-smart."
replied Pats.
<p>
They listened in silence for about a half hour.  Patsy sharpened her dirk
knife she cleverly kept concealed under her lace socks.  Pansy looked
through the Children's Encyclopaedia Brittanicish, reading intently.  They
were about to give up (seeing as how they were already 15 minutes past their
bedtimes), when they heard a phone ring in the sinister stranger's office.
<p>
"Hello," said the stranger.  A pause, and then, "Yes, they arrived this
afternoon...No, no reported problems...Yes, the anaconda is
safe...What?...Oh, no, I don't think the typhoons will give us any problem
this year...Another shipment?  Look, Rufus, I'm trying to unload all of
these Official stinkin P--...But it's....Look, alls I'm trying to say is
that I can't do it all at once like that.  We're still working with the
distributors and paying off the quality control people and it's been
[expletive deleted] trying to get past the royalties people...OK, I
understand...Right...bye."
<p>
Patsy's eyes widened in excitement, threatening to pop right out of her
face, and only partially from the deleted expletive her shell-pink ears
couldn't possibly have heard in a young adult's story.  "Oh, I wish we could
have heard the other side to the conversation," she wheedled.
<p>
Pansy looked up and was about to comment, when they heard a yawn coming
through the radio, a loud bang that generated a flash of feedback, an odd
sound rather like and Official Parkey Twins Bug being aspirated by a
sinister stranger's throat, and then spasmodic choking noises and wheezing,
taxed breath.  At last a sloppy "GULP" sound emerged, and something that may
have sounded like a "plop" if it hadn't been abruptly cut off; empty static
crackled through the speaker.
<p>
Patsy's mouth opened in a cute little horrified "O."  "Pansy, I think he ate
our bug!"
<p>
"That's nothing," Pansy said and held up the Q volume she'd been perusing.
"I was looking for that tattoo design in the encyclopedia where I KNOW I'd
seen it before, and look what I found...!"

  "We needs yous ta do a job for us, Dixie." She said as she sat down on the corner of my desk, crossed those legs that seemed to go on forever, and whipped out a cigarette. She let it and handed it to the alligator.
<p>
"Thanks." The alligator said standing up on it's hind legs.
<p>
Something wasn't right here. I could feel it in my bones. A dame and a talking alligator, sure, I've seen lots of them, but I ain't never seen an alligator that smokes before. I opened the top left drawer of my desk and pulled out a bottle of rum.
<p>
"Want some?" I asked Gia. She grabbed the bottle from my hands and held it up to the alligator's lips. Didn't look like I'd be gettin'' drunk before this case...

<h3><a href=mailto:R10838@email.sps.mot.com>Erebus</a> begins a Science Fiction novel 02/07/98</h3>
As Jasphont rode his stallion into the valley, he wondered if he would 
find the old man that he was sent to kill.  Jasphont had killed many people
in his day.  He was a trusted black warrior of King Herephin.  He was 
trained to be more than a warrior, he was an assasin.   An expert in his 
skill he enjoyed the hunt and the kill.  This should be an easy job.  He 
had been travelling on the road for almost two months now and he new he 
was close.   The valley that he entered was green and plush.  He followed 
the trail as it wound its way deeper into the valley.  The trees was getting
thicker and bigger now.  Still he pushed his horse onward.   He could feel
that he was getting closer now to the old man.  Jasphont wondered what the
old man had done to piss off King Herephin.  It didn't really matter, he was 
anxious to get the job done and get back to the kingdom.  As Jasphont pushed
on, he wondered how he would dispatch the old man.  He really enjoyed 
using the  sharp dirk he carried under his tunic.   He liked to look into 
their eyes as he killed them, something intrigued him about watching their
eyes as they died.
<p>
As Jasphont entered a clearing, he saw the smoke coming from a chimney of 
a little house that was bulit beside the trail.   He knew that this was 
the home of the old man that he was looking for.  It was just as King 
Herphin described it to him.   Jasphont also remembered what the King told
him before he left.  Do not let your guard down, the old man is more 
dangerous than you think.  Get the job done quickly.  Do not trust 
appearances.
<p>
Jasphont stopped his horse in front of the house.   He yelled out, "Is 
anyone home".  No one answered.  It had become very quiet now.  He could 
smell the wood burning, that was coming out of the chimney.  He felt a uneasy
feeling in his stomach.  The smoke from the chimney started to have a sweet
smell to it.  He started to feel faint.  He clutched at his reigns, but 
suddenly he lost his balance and fell off of his horse.   He had trouble 
breathing now.   It seemed like the smoke from the house was dancing all 
around him.   He felt the smoke inside of him and it was heavy as a brick.
He could not breathe.  He started to drift off into oblivion.  As he lay 
on the ground, next to his head a pair of sandles with two very old feet 
appeared.   As the appartion started to take more form, a very old man 
appeared out of the smoke and looked down at Jasphont........

<h3><a href=mailto:R10838@email.sps.mot.com>Erebus</a> begins a  novel 02/06/98</h3>
Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.  "Sire, the Chingaderas have destroyed the last output and are on the
outskirts of the city.  What are we going to do!"  
<p>
"Damm it", thought Zog, where in the hell was Stumpy, when he needed him.  
The one legged sorcerer for the court was never around when he needed him.
(Little did Zog realize that Stumpy at this particular moment in time was
trapped in another bad story, somewhere on this page)
<p>
If Stumpy doesn't show up soon, I'll cut his other leg off, thought Emperor
Zog.  For now, I'll deal with these Chingadera bitches from hell.   Who 
do they think they are, marching on my city.   
<p>
Zog looked at his cleric, Danielle and thought, "Once I dispatch of these 
annoying Chingadera's, I think I'll take Danielle up to the tower and show
her my family jewels.  If her mouth taste as good as it looks, I might even
let her ride the sacred steel rod of Valthanus.
<p>
A large rumble just went up form outside the Kings audience room.   Danielle
yelled, "Sire, the chingaderas are here, what are we going to do".  Zog
looked up from the floor he had been staring at and yelled to his Captain
of the Guards, "Summon the Red Guard, it's time to burn some Chingadera rump.
And bring Danielle up to my tower".
<p>
Suddenly everything started to go into slow motion for Zog.  He looked out
into his throne room and everything started to look like a sandy grained
picture.  Everthing was coming to a stand still.   There was smoke coming 
from everywhere.  He smelt a disgusting smell, like rotten egg and fishhead
sandwiches.  Zog started to close his eyes.
<p>
When he opened them he was in a small room looking at the ceiling.  The 
smell was still there and stronger than before.   Suddenly he heard a 
badda rumpf, badda rumpt, badddda rumptta.   He turned and saw an extremely
fat obese woman laying by his side passing gas.   The smell was enough to
make you toenails curl.  Zog yelled, "What sorcery is this"!  
<p>
The fat women turned to Zog and yelled, "Jack, get up you drunken bastard,
your late for your garbage truck run."  "OH, shit", yelled the fat woman at 
Zog, "You masterbated all over me again, you disgusting creep."
<p>
"Jack, Who's Jack", thought Zog.  Something is not right here............

The crabazoidal creatures from the rim of anus were slowly taking over the

I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.<p>
  I looked this alligator square in the eyes.  I knew how to handle swamp rats like him - I used to wrestle them for a living, but that's not important.  Anyway the alligator was about to snap at me, I think the dame was too.  But the room suddenly became dark - a shot rang out - a dull thud.  The lights came back on as I wiped " Legs'" blood offa my face.  Then I looked for the alligator... gone.  Not a trace of it, no way to find it.  Ahh well, no sweat offa my balls, looked like trouble anyway....
<p>
I decided to take the rest of the day off and go back to my place.  I opened the door to my place to find a mess of scattered papers, tipped over furniture, a broken t.v., and two naked bodies sprawled out on the floor.  Damn, wrong room again.  All thes damn doors look the same to me, no numbers - very confusing.  Hmm, I hope this is my door.  Yup my room all right, only one I ever seen like this.  No major furniture, no t.v., no scattered papers.  Nothing at all, really.  Except for a lawn chair surrounded by empty cartons of P.I. Reds cigarettes and a tall reading lamp standing beside it.  Don't like a lot of clutter in my place.  Can't afford it actually, but I could really care less.
<p>
A knock at the door - I get my gun and peer through that little glass 
circle to find no one there.  As soon as I sit down the knocking is back... 
still no one.  I decide it's pranksters and sit next to the door to 
wrench the door open and shove a gun down their throat (heh heh).  
A knock - I swing the door open - the alligator makes a surprising 
reappearance.
