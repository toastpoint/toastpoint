<h3>Hilarious C. Linton begins a timely Novel of Political Intrigue, albeit
a short one, 1/27</h3>

The President sat quietly stroking Buddy, softly at first and then more
deliberately. The media orgies surrounding the latest allegations were
hard on him, and he’d be relieved when public interest finally petered
out.

"But really, Bartholomew" laughed Lady Zinnia with her characteristic 
throaty chuckle, "You can't be serious!  Lady Thanninger, with that 
dashing young... oh, no, it can't be.  He's simply too <em>common</em> 
for someone of her station!"<p>
  Bartholomew let flee a chuckle only slightly less characteristic of him, 
but somewhat characteristic, nevertheless.  "It seems everyone is indeed surprised by her 
unusual choice," he intoned, while staring into the eyes in the picture
in the frame on the nearby finely-crafted table.  So blue, he thought.
They reminded him of summers at Lake Winnepesaukee, so many years previous.
Could it have been twenty years?  Was Lady Thanninger really that old?  Why would
such an old love betray him in this way? Wherefore?<p>
	"To hell with her!," he bellowed, the hair on his chest rising and falling, 
as his chest rose and fell in rhythm with his heavy breathing.  "I'll have
you, Rolonda!"<p>
	Lady Zinnia froze at the bold daring that suddenly took hold of the 
hulking Bartholomew.  To call her by her Christian name! Brute!<p>
	But still she found herself hurled into a universe whose sole inhabitants
were named Lust and Desire.  Hello, Lust.  Hello, Desire.  Meet Rolonda
Zinnia, former debutante extraordinaire, currently your prisoner.  As his greedy
tongue found its way along her delicate porcelain cheek, she could only
surrender to her clever captor.  "Take me," she cried. "I am yours for life.
And there's no chance of parole."

<h3><a href=mailto:dkleinke@acun.com>DeeDee Klein</a> begins a Romance novel 01/25/98</h3>
Monique, shivering despite the near-tropic heat, contemplated the sleeping man beside her.  Was she really now 
the wife of a Duke who she had never met?  Everything had happened 
so fast since she stepped off of the Pacific Princess...<p>
  Monique didn't quite realize the station that she now possessed.  
All she could think about was the man she left behind. The french painter, Philip. 
The man that took her breath away every time he cast his blue eyes upon her.  The arranged 
marriage would never keep her from Philip. <p>
She quietly stole from the marriage bed and walked to the open veranda doors.  
The blue horizon, the cool carribean breeze and the smell of the sea reminded her of the times 
she spent on the French Riveria.  What a fantasy world it had been waking up in Philip's 
strong arms.  How they made her feel safe, and how they pulled the life from  her every time 
they came together. Their love was something that took her breath away.  
How she longed to see him. To feel him. To smell his manly scent.  
<p>
She closed her eyes and let the memories carry her to the place she longed to be.  
How was she ever to tell Philip that she was someone else's wife.  A tear trickled down  
the lovely ivory skin of her face!<p>
She was suddenly taken from her dream by the hand of her betrothed.  
She couldn't bear to look at the man she had just spent the night with.  
Every time he touched her in the night she wanted no one but Philip and she almost 
called out his name as the fullness of life sprung from inside her. 
She knew she must live with this decision, however her heart gave into a love that was now 
forbidden.

<h3><a href=mailto:tekelly@nasx.com>YANA</a> begins a novel 1/24</h3>
The house was small, not very well kept and possessed an odor all of it's own.  However, the few furnishings were of good taste  for a single man in his mid fifties.  Everything seemed to have its very own place as each room was without a trace of clutter. 
Mac Linsey had not always been such a neat person but ever since the sudden, mysterious
death of his wife, Renee, he worked hard to keep the house clean and tidy.  
<p>
He reached just inside the door and flipped the light switch to the living room.  A cold chill ran down his spine as he
realized the house had been totally ripped apart.  Not one single thing seemed to be where he had left it earlier in the day when 
he had jumped in his car and headed down to the police station to answer some more questions about the last time he saw Renee alive.

They had taken Stumpy and strapped him to the hairy chingadera's rump.
Only having one leg and a stump for the other, Stumpy knew that he didn't 
stand a chance of breaking free from the skank's rump roast.  He was going 
to have to ride this one out.   She was big for a skank.  The biggest he
has ever seen or been this close to.   The reek from her orfice was making
him sick.   The dwarf warriors that had strapped him on, were all standing 
around betting on how long he would last.  Stumpy started to feel her 
muscles from inside the hole beginning to suck his pole in.   He knew this 
was it.   Suddenly he heard a yell from on top of the hill.  It was Borous,
the neophyte virgin, she was yelling,  "Go for it Stumpy, show them what
being a man is all about."  ...............

I stumbled into my office to catch a couple hours of shut eye before
the clients started banging the door down. The landlady'd padlocked my 
flat so I couldn't flop there, and if my gecko died why it'd be on her 
conscience.  I strode across the wood floor and had taken off my coat
when I noticed something amiss.  The radio was on as usual but the
room was redolent of something besides its usual bouquet of too many
cigarettes, bad coffee and cheap booze.  It was perfume--White Linen if
I wasn't mistaken.  There was a dame by my credenza, mixing drinks in
the dark.  The red neon sign with two burned out letters flashed 
outside the fire-escape window exit as the tattered curtains flared in 
the stale mission-district breeze.  I doffed my snap brim fedora and 
tossed it onto the coat tree as the skirt poured me a couple of 
fingers of Cuervo into a jelly glass.  "Warm Beer and Cold Women" 
played out over the static from the old deco style 16-transistor on 
the side table.  A cat howled in the alley and a cracked plaster jesus 
got a hotfoot from the radiator.  I'd spent the rest of the 5 big ones 
some bird name of Lola had coughed up to skip trace the thug who'd 
pulled a caper with her meal ticket.  Some two-bit wage ape named Earl 
who thought he could buy a shortcut out of the trailer park by running 
some scam but fell in with the wrong crowd.  Turned out he was 
dirt-napping so she never came through with other half.  Anyway I was 
a day late and a dollar short, and this tomato looked plenty flush, 
judging from the ice on her ring finger and the wad of Ben Franks 
she casually tossed on my wormeaten desk.
                                    
<p>
"Whattya want?"                                                           
<p>
"Whattya got?"                                                            
<p>
"Who's askin?"                                                            
<p>
"Who's tellin?"                                                           
<p>
"Stop me if you've heard this one..."                                     
<p>
"Aw you don't look like such a chump..."                                  
<p>
"The hell're we talkin about?"                                       
<p>
"Thought you knew..."  
<p>
"Me? What's your dodge?"                                                   
<p>
"Back up a second there."   A tear in her eye.  My head reeled.  The 
blower jingled.  I hit the mouthpiece with the heel of my hand and 
caught it by the earpiece as it catapulted above the desk.
<p>
"Talk to me."  Evenly, I coolly stared levelly at my guest.  Her jelly 
glass and my forehead began to sweat.<p>

"Hey Abe you slaphappy old windbag, it's me, Tommy McSmith from the
16th.  I'm at Nates.  Can't talk long but you should expect some company.
Nice broad, real pipefitter if you catch my meaning..." I glanced over
as she sat down on the couch and crossed her long silk-clad gams with a
soft rustle.  She had party hats in her sweater and I was getting 
lumber in my pants. "...she's on the up and up and'll pay you in real
scratch, and she's loaded.  She wants to keep the whole thing out of 
the scandal rags and asked if I knew a private dick so I sent her your 
way.  Oh shit, here comes the Sarge, me and Hambone have to finish 
our tour." He hung up and I cradled the blower.   McSmith was a 23-year
man on the force and a damn fine patrolman.  
<p>

I looked at the frail.  Her headlights were on highbeam and I fought not
to squint.  The foghorn in the bay moaned its sad dirge and a streetcorner
oboist noodled out some Mingus for spare change.  A baby cried and a 
heart broke and someone in the distance cried "ya trumped my ace ya
friggin mope bastid ya" and a milk bottle broke.  I swigged the Cuervo
in my Flinstones glass and wondered if Wilma was hot in bed.  I lit a
cigarette and eyeballed the cooze.  She wasn't talking, for which I 
was grateful.  She hadn't made much sense on her first try.  I muttered
"S'pose we start again sweet face, and s'pose you try it slow and in 
English this time.  Remember that its OK to breath in once in a while..."

<img src="../../gifs/star3.gif" alt="Gold Star!" align="right">
The bird on my davenport uncrossed her long stems and looked up at me
with sad puffy violet peepers.  She looked to be mid to late thirties, 
somewhat underslung but still easy enough on the eyes.  She'd either 
been around the block one too many times or had been crying.  Her coiffed
conk was a brunette the color of the stale Santo Domingan panatelas in 
my desktop humidor.  She spoke again, in a husky musky dusky voice that
bespoke too many bourbons and smokes in afterhours dives.  <p>
"I'm sorry Mr. Fisher, it's just I-"<p>
"Call me Abe, sister.  And here's how it works.  You tell me your 
handle and state your case, and then I tell you one of two things.
But first things first.   You work at Nate's but you only been there 
under three days.  You got something big on your plate you want to keep 
outta the society pages, prolly something to do with an ex husband.  
At work you met a big plug ugly flatfoot name of McSmith and his
partner Hambone on the beat scamming free coffee and Wild Turkey offa 
Nate and they seemed friendly enough palookas and so's you spilled 
your beans, and they gave you my calling card. Go ahead, shoot some 
holes in my story so far."  Her eyes were wide now and I had her rapt 
attention.  <p>
"Jack."<p>
"Huh?"<p>
"Free coffee and Jack Daniels."<p>
"Old Tommy's ulcer must be heating up again."<p>
"But the rest of it...how did you--"<p>
"Listen sis, I been in this dodge long enough to know what's what and 
what isn't."  This leggy little filly sported the same petroleum-based 
garment Nate hung on all his shortorder cooks.  I knew McSmith and 
Hambone's habits and I practically lived at Nate's and hadn't seen 
this broad before.  I'd been upstate for three days sniffing cold leads 
into hot ones on some Brink's job.  A little pigeon I knew would sing 
an aria for a thimbleful of hootch dropped the dime on the perps and 
they were now logging a shift in the cooler and I was waiting for 
Brink's to float me some good paper posthaste by way of reward.  My 
longstemmed guest had a big chunk of ice on her right ring finger and 
the imprint from it on her left, and apparently I'd guessed dead-on 
about the ex. What I couldn't put my finger on was why she was slinging
hash for some smalltime punchdrunk low-rent ex-heavyweight-contender-
has-been like Nate when she was sitting on a wad of c-notes like the 
one on my desk. She looked up again, and turned on the waterworks.  
A single saltwater tear glistened on her cheek and a small drop of
snot beaded up under the tip of her nose.   A taxicab honked and a 
peepshow barker hawked his wares in the distance and a faraway voice 
cried "Checkmate? checkmate my ass.  I'll show ya checkmate ya foogin 
bastid ya!" and a garbage can tipped over.  Diesel fumes from
an Elko-bound Trailways wafted through the torn screen.  A litho
print of some bunnies and cherubs frolicking in a dewy meadow hung
crookedly from the patched sheetrock right next to the framed and 
yellowed certificate that granted me the license to be a private dick.
This dame's front porched heaved mightily under the illfitting outfit
as she sobbed.  <p>
"There there," I muttered as I handed her a hanky.  "S'posin you just
tell me who you are and what you want."<p>
"Wanda.  Wanda Lodge.  And I want you to find them." And with that
she dropped an old kodak moment on the desk, right on top of the heap 
of big ones.

<p>

But thank you very much for trying."
<p>
<center><h3><a name="donuts3">Chapter Three</a></h3></center>
So the dame in my office had a handle and a story.  And a cool one point
seven  G's she had dropped nonchalantly on the stained brown 
blotter on my desk.  She dried her tears and blew her nose and adjusted
the cameo that dangled on a tarnished chain and hung ensconsed
between her lively sweater puffs.  I lit an Old Gold and offered her
the pack.  She took it, said "no thanks" and put it in her purse.  I 
shrugged and looked at the worn photo she had dropped on the heap 
of centuries.  I fingered it. <p>

"Nice lookin fella.  Whose kids?"  The photo was of a swarthy, meanlooking
thug with no neck, bad acne and a knife scar across his cheek.  His 
upper lip sneered Elvis-like as he glared at the camera.  He had enough 
body hair to look like he wore his tank tee shirt over a black sweater.
A shoulder rig held a pearlhandled .38.  He was holding a sno-cone 
and was standing with two small children, one with a dirty face and
the other wearing a Yoda mask, and they were in front of a 
frightened-looking Tilt-a-whirl attendant at a travelling carny.
Wanda Lodge looked at the photo and became flustered. "Oh, I--uh, my
mistake, wrong picture.  Pardon me..." as she snatched the photo from
my hand and produced another photo, one which was in even worse shape,
of two miniature dachsunds.  I'm no animal lover, but I always wanted
a wiener dog just so's I could give him a moniker of "Boner".  I smiled
wryly to myself and muttered, "Nice lookin dogs.  Whose are they?"
Wanda Lodge shook her head and said, "That rotten lyin' so-an'-so isn't
gonna get away with it.  He stold my pwecious diddle schnooky-wooky 
puppy-wuppies and their mommy misses them somethin' awful..." lapsing
into a sickeningly cloying baby-talk voice that made me want to smack her
hard right in the puss.  I thought about the seventeen hundred simoleons
and change on my desk and bit my tongue.  Outside the fog rolled in 
from the bay and a siren wailed.  A cat howled in the alley and a '79 
Merc lost a hubcap as it hit a heavy sheetmetal plate where the 
backhoe'd torn up the street again and in the distance a voice cried 
"candlestick schmandlestick, all's I'm sayin is, is either Colonel 
Mustard whacked him in da consoivatory wid a leadpipe, or youse guys 
are a buncha lyin' weasels, is all..." and the trombonist upstairs 
began practicing his pedal tones... Wanda Lodge was lost in reverie, 
staring at the photo of her little sluggy nuggle wumpums.  If she kept 
up the babytalk I was afraid I'd have to give her the back of my hand, 
simoleons or no. I usually nixed animal cases ever since that mink farm
case that went south in Abilene a halfscore years ago. There'd been bad
blood between me and a Pinkertons gumshoe named Crabtree ever since.  
That was then and this was now, and all I knew now was that I only had
two George Washingtons to my name, and I didn't mean the folding kind--and
fifty cents couldn't even buy a cup of instant decaf in this sorry depot.
I didn't have the full bird's eye lowdown on this Wanda Lodge caper yet,
but the one point seven large was looking mighty big about now.  
"Tell you what sister.  Let's you and me get a cup of joe at the donut shop
downstairs and you spill what you know about your little mangy bungle sluggy
wumpers."<p>

"Huggy snuggle bunny burgers."  She rose and sashayed to the splintered 
door.<p>

I cocked my fist and eyed the nape of her neck, hard.  I looked at the desk,
scooped up the pile of crisp sheets, and muttered, "Whatever."

Ice cubes jingle while he swirles his glass of bourbon.
<p>
"Ma," he thought as he stared at the <a href=tyrol.jpg>picture</a>.  "What the hell has gotten into you?" Midwest home, eight kids, twenty-seven grandkids.  Decides to take a seniors tour to the Alps with her peanuckle pals and sends me this picture with a note:
<p>
"Roger.  You are the oldest so I am sending this to you.  You will be responsible for letting the others know.
<p>Ever since your father died, I have had an emptiness inside ... one so great that it weighs heavy upon my heart.  Until I met Hans."

Roger wads up the note for the umpteenth time and nods to the bartender.  Another long drag from the cig isn't helping ... damn headache getting worse.
<p>Another bourbon on the bar and he opens the note again.
<p>"I could tell you how and where we met, but I am afraid it would not matter much to you.  What should matter to you is how I feel..."
<p>
He wads up the note again.  His fourth bourbon and it hasn't dulled the sting.  He unravels the note once more.
<p>
"... and I feel wonderful.  Hans has the longest penis I have ever seen.  Worn as a belt or skipping like rope, he is really big.  Hans has to wear penal suspenders just to be able to walk out of the house.  Your father, god rest his soul, was NO WHERE NEAR ..."
<p>
He wads up the note once again.  He has read the note over and over and it doesn't change.  He opens the note again. 
<p>
"... and you know how alike you and your father ..."
<p>
Wads it up again.
<p>
"What am I gonna say?  She's staying in Europe to schtoop a Tyrolean?" he thinks.  He glances at the picture again ... "Damn, she does look happy ... too happy."  He looks deeper into the picture.  "Hmmmmmmmmmmm.  Looks like Mr. French..."  He opens up the note.
<p>
"I must be going now.  Hans is going to show me how he finds truffles.  Give kisses to my grandchildren for me.  Love you, Mom."
<p>
Roger crumbles up the note one last time and shoves it in his pocket.  He takes one last drag from the cig and chases it with the last of his drink.

"Whatever."

<h3>Ian Phlegmming begins a Spy novel 01/18/98</h3>
Isadore slowly sunk into a sophomoric stupor. The baccarat table, the glitter of 
Monaco, the initial excitement, had all faded. Reality had set in. This was her last 
chance; her last opportunity to parlay her dear uncle's manure fortune into 
a lifetime of glamour and excitement - a lifetime of fast cars, faster men, and faster 
romances, a lifetime of designer bras and Grey Poupon - it all depended on the next 
roll of the dice.
<p>
Then he appeared. The mysterious stranger. Seemingly coming from out of nowhere, he 
was there by her side. She didn't notice him at first, but gradually, almost 
unknowingly, became aware of his presence. Was it the stench of rancid beer on his
tuxedo? The smell of stale cigarette smoke? The decaying anchovies in his breast 
pocket? Or was is the perfume of years of uncontrolled flatulence that had permeated 
every thread of his clothing that called her attention to him?
<p>
At this point, it didn't matter. Isadore turned her head to face the stranger, as 
though a giant hand had caressed her chin and nudged it in his direction. And, 
she saw him. She'd remember her first impressions for a long time. She saw the 
overaged, overweight, yet somehow imposing stranger. But, in a way, he fascinated her 
in his ramshackle tuxedo, a garment that appeared to have been fitted to him 
by the same epileptic who sold it to him at the Good Will shop. And, there was 
something about the way he carried himself - the cigarette strategically hanging 
out of his left nostril, his artificial eye gazing toward the heavens, the cummerbund 
that caressed his oversized belly more like a sling for a giant hernia.
<p>
And she was desperate. This was her last chance. When the stranger walked even closer 
and put his hand on her shoulder, she suppressed her revulsion and breathed a sigh of 
relief. She might have a chance, after all.
<p>
And then in a strangely seductive way, the stranger spoke.
<p>
        "My name is Bond. Melvin Bond."

Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared

"Cleric Veneg, How dare you enter my chamber at this hour of the night?", growled the emperor, "I will have you incinerated in a quantum plasma chamber if this is another false alarm!"
<p>"No, your excellency. It seems that the outer reaches of our planetary domain has been attacked by the carnivorous Grells of the Beta Arcturian system." gasped Veneg, " They have begun an all out war and have slaughtered thousands of our innocent people at several of our outposts."

<p>"What do you mean the Grells?" hissed Zog, "I wiped them and their carnivorously humanoid kind five hundred cycles ago?"
<p>"Your Grace, these Grells are the decedents of the ten or so of them that escaped in the last escape pod of the Grellian conflict." "It seems that they were rather prolific and denuded several worlds with their carnage before setting out in the direction of our outposts."
<p>
"I will have none of this!," shouted Zog, causing the sleeping imperial guards to awakening in a panicked stir. " I though our outposts were thousands of light cycles away from the site of our last and triumphant battle?"
<p>
"Your excellency,  As you know our people are all recently transplanted refugees from our last cycle's supernova in the Sephrian system. I am afraid they were caught unarmed and in the process of building shelters for their families before the cycle of planting."
<p>"I beg of you your grace. Please let me go as a representative of the council along with a royal armada and help us repel these creatures. They are powerful and have to be reasoned with before their attack continues into what are now, our stable outer colonies. It is a matter of security in our quadrant."
<p>"If we do not stop them now. I fear the rest of our domain will think we are powerless and begin another era of instability and war among all our brothers."
<p>"Your highness, how shall I proceed?"

I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.
  Those legs, those legs, those legs, and the hat was quite spiffy also. I was smitten.

conferences that his embarassing behavior had generated over the

Respector Dogleash found the motor car he had rented to be lacking in
quality and the drive to the dark cliffs of Woever was becoming increas-
ingly sinister, taking on the atmosphere of the nuclear energy facility
some 18 kilometers ahead on the cut-off road that bordered the abandon-
ed sewage treatment works, site of 4 quite malodorous murders the pre-
vious year. Dogleash unconsciously shifted his long legs, thus inadvertantly 
depressing the accelerator, until his speed caused the trees bordering the parkway 
to appear only as a gray-green blur.<p>
Suddenly a car
approached in the gathering dusk and appeared to be speeding toward
Dogleash with unwavering determination.  He gripped the wheel and swerved
at the last second, avoiding what would certainly have been a deadly
head-on collision.  Enervated,he pulled into a nearby lay-about to recover his normally 
imperturable demeanor and began to ponder the
seemingly deliberate attempt on his life which probably would have resulted in what 
amounted to suicide for the oncoming driver. Dogleash
reached for his gold watch chain to verify the hour and discovered it 
was gone. He had not been without that watch since his father had willed
it to him 25 years ago.  A bit shaken but still resolute, he engaged the

Emperor Zog grimaced as another cold draft ruffled the wyrnyr-fur trimming 
of his crimsom cape - a regal relic handed down through generations of 
emperors.  Looming over the council chamber, he perched upon a silver throne, 
constructed of the swords gleaned from a long line of opponents not as 
quick or ruthless as he, and glowered at the upstart cleric who dared 
interrupt his train of thought.  "I cannot believe this!" he 
screamed mightily, destroying a nearby attendent's eardrum and causing 
him to be taken to the hospital.  "My homosexual son cannot be back 
so soon," the mighty emperor muttered to himself, "I sent him out 
on a suicide mission!"  He looked down from his mighty throne and 
shifted his weight significantly.  There was a slight rush of indrawn breath as 
he almost speared himself through the butt 
(<i>kids, sitting on a throne of swords is BLOODY DANGEROUS!</i>).
<p>
"Well," the great emperor of all declaimed in a high and mighty voice 
(incidentally causing a nearby chandelier to shatter, spearing several 
aides with razor-sharp shards of crystal), "send him in and we'll see 
what we can do!".  As the great doors opened, permitting a slight youth 
to enter.  The youth gazed around at the carnage that surrounded him and asked meekly: "Father, are you just a leeeeeeetle bit peeved with me?".  Gazing down under majestic brows, the majestic majesty majestically said (majestically of course), "Yes.".
<p>
<i>As a perfectly pointless bit of puerile information, many frogs use their throat sacs as a secondary sexual characteristic.  We now return you to your regular programming.

"Tell me," Zog cried in a great voice (his sonic vibrations flinging several of his drinking buddies into a inconveniently-placed rack of spears), "what would it take for me to get the hell rid of you, you evil sod?".  The sod, err, son, grinned evilly (he was after all an evil sod) and murmered: "The hand of the fabulously beautiful but as-yet-unnamed Princess, and a lifetime of small yet extremely valuable presents?".  The mighty emperor considered this for a moment, then shook his head.  "I can't do that," he screeched (inadvertently summoning a swarm of Outer-Venusian Mongolese adult wombats who mistook his cry to be the call of a Nether-Feathered Golden Flufbutt, their favourite food), "because we are at war, and I cannot spare the expense!".

Glancing around disdainfully, the young emperor-to-be suddenly locked eyes with his father, daring him to repeat his refusal.

<center><h1>A "Family Affair" Affair</h1></center>
Throughout the running of the American classic TV epic "Family Affair," 
Beth had a secret crush on Mr. French. She longed for the day when she 
would actually meet him, and she fantasized about what would take place. 
She believed that he would be as enamored with her pouting lips and 
sensuous overbite as she was of his sturdy frame and well-maintained 
facial hair. Beth felt that the meeting was inevitable, as a longing of 
such power and intensity could not go unquanched. As each episode of the 
show unveiled, she sat with her girlfriends watching intently every move 
the rotund butler made. Many times when the credits rolled, a small tear 
would form in the corner of one eye. "Sebastian Cabot," Beth would mutter 
quietly, "one day we will meet and fulfill our destiny."     
<p>
<h3>Southerner <a name="family2">continues 1/19</h3>
After a watching a particularly heart-wrenching episode in which Buffy
lost Mrs. Beasley; and Mr. French, in his characteristic inimitable way,
demonstrated his caring concern that was so characteristic of him—plus
he made cookies, Beth could stand it no more. She resolved must meet
Sebastian Cabot, whom (she was quite sure) exuded the same care and
concern—if not more so— that his TV character exuded.
<p>
She counted her allowance that she’d been saving all year, cashed in a
few savings bonds that she’d gotten for birthdays and Christmas from
relatives too busy—too uncaring and unconcerned!—to shop, and forged her
father’s name on a check she’d slipped from his checkbook while he was
watching a Gunsmoke rerun. Yes, she had enough to make the trip to the
TV studio, and to buy a few things that she’d need to make a good
impression on Mr. Cabot. Her destiny was within her grasp. Some
people—mainly her friends who danced about in their mini-skirts and
white go-go boots, and who had wild passionate crushes on Donny
Osmond—might think her a foolish, impetuous fourteen year-old, but she’d
show them. She’d show them all!
<p>
The next day, wearing her new Maidenform Chansonette bra and a pair of
stack heels that made her look mature even though they pinched her toes,
she slipped out of the side door of school just after first period, made
her way to the bus station, and purchased her ticket. As she rode the
Greyhound bus toward her destination (Her date with destiny!), she
wondered what should she call him when at last they met—she dewey-eyed
and expectant; he tired and sweaty from working under the hot lights and
perhaps a tad resentful of all the attention that Brian Keith was
getting when he, Sebastian Cabot, was by far the better actor? “Mr.
Cabot” seemed too formal. “Sebastian” seemed, well, awkward. “Sebby”?
“Basty”? Maybe just “Seb”?

I had seen broads like Gia Gondola before - Miami's full of 'em.  But 
when a broad constructed of nothing but legs, attitude and a wide-brimmed 
hat stalks into your office unannounced and drops a baby alligator on 
your desk, you sit up and take notice.   That's especially true if you've been slouched in your chair with your 
feet up on the desk.  The prepubescent reptile, jaws snapping open and 
shut, lurched with remarkable quickness across the desk toward my gaping 
pants cuffs.  In a heartbeat he was inside my pantleg, gnashing his teeth 
and thrashing his way toward the forbidden zone.
<p>
I stood up quickly, shaking the pantleg, trying to dislodge the hungry 
gator.  To hide my discomfiture, I leered at Gia lasciviously and 
said, "Hey Doll, long time no see.  Where ya been."  
<p>
She answered with her usual girlish charm, "None of you business, 
you two-timing, no-account, two-bit gumshoe."  Having dispensed with 
pleasantries, she pulled a small, pearl-handled semi-automatic pistol 
from her sequinned handbag and aimed it at my heart.
<p>
It had been a long time since Gia and I had been lovers...a long time 
since she had broken the heart that she was now aiming at.  Based on the 
alligator's progress, it seemed likely that we would never be lovers again,
regardless of the tender feelings she had just expressed to me.
<p>
"Put your hands up and don't make a move, Chauncy!" she shouted.
<p>
Thinking quickly, I shouted back, "Forget it doll!  You'd never shoot me.  
You still remember those nights we shared down in Havana...the clubs, the 
drinks, the dancing, the wild abandon, the nights of passion.  I know you 
too well Gia.  You'd never shoot a man you were still in love with."  In 
actual fact, we had never been to Havana, and had enjoyed only one night 
of passion...or I should say that I had enjoyed it.  If she had stayed 
awake longer, I'm sure she would have found it memorable as well.
<p>
I left my hands down, in my pockets, and risked being shot through the 
heart.  That seemed more promising than raising my hands as Gia had 
demanded, and risking my future happiness to the jaws of the ravening 
reptile in my trousers.  I cursed silently under my breath because  a whim 
of fashion had very recently brought pleated fronts back into style, 
offering the gator plenty of room to maneuver and evade my desparately 
clutching fingers. I chose death before dishonor and left my hands where 
they were.
<p>
Gia stared at me icily for a minute.  I realized hopelessly that my pleas 
had fallen on a ears deafened by same the raging passion that I was trying 
to appeal to.  
<p>
"I warned you, Chauncy." she said, her voice sharp with cold indifference.  
She squinted, adjusted her aim in an alarming fashion, and fired.
<p>
For a moment, time stood still.  I could almost see the projectile hurtling
toward me.  I could feel each of the gator's sharp little teeth closing on 
my tender flesh.  Pain cut through me like a knife, my sight grew dim, I 
weaved and staggered backward.  I could feel the hot lead and groaned what 
I was sure would be my last goodbye to Gia.  Then everything went black.
<p>
When I came to, Gia was looking down into my eyes.  "You big crazy 
galoot", she said, "You should have put your hands up when I told ya' to.  
I think I grazed ya'."  A distinctive throb of pain told me I was a little 
more than grazed...but I was far better off than I might have been if she 
had missed the gator.  She had apparently made a perfect head shot on the 
gator, killing him the instant before his jaws closed, and wounding me 
painfully but not dangerously.
<p>
"You've ruined my pants, babe." I sighed, smiling weakly, happy to be 
alive.  
<p>
"That's your fault." she replied.  "But don't feel badly, I've heard that 
most people loose muscle control like that in times of extreme stress." 
she crooned.
<p>
"I meant the bullet hole." I groaned.  
<p>
Those were the last words I spoke before the ambulance arrived for me and 
the police came to take Gia away.  
<p>
Alligators are an endangered species.  Protected by laws that would send 
my sweet, passionate, mixed up Gia up the river, to the big house, for a
long long time.

      He stood on boulder-strewn ledge at the base of a remote butte,   
 blue-white lightning flashing in the background but no rain yet.       
 He stood haggard and careworn yet strangely alert, like the last       
 surviving conscript from some deranged militia defending the ramparts  
 of Bedlam from an imagined and terrifying invading horde.  He stood    
 amid the slag heaps and tailings from a long abandoned copper mine     
 and thought about an old life, a life in which he had an office and    
 storebought clothes and a clean shave and a house and a family and     
 a future.  He stood looking down on his domain: an adobe wreck with    
 a corrugated tin roof, a spent mule, small game furs tanning on a      
 rack, some hemp clothes and a serape on a line that he'd lifted        
 from a corpse in the foothills and from which he'd almost completely   
 removed the bloodstains.  A shotgun and a very small number of         
 precious shells, and a handmade crossbow with several whittled arrows. 
 And finally, the wind:  the Santa Ana, the Mistral, the trades, none of
 these could compare to the relentless roar of the wind that sanded the 
 north side of the boulders and scrub trees to a carpenter's finish,    
 the wind that he heard whether it was windy out or not, the wind that  
 reminded him of the name he'd been given in yet another

     As Kix approached the center of town, he began to wonder if
the strain of recent events was starting to make him lose his
wits. Sitting in the middle of the street was an empty rocking
chair. A well coifed middle aged woman was running about
screaming and frantically dialing a portable phone. A deranged
looking girl of who knows what age was hanging over the side of
one truck alternately grinning and making a terrible
"Aweehhheenck" noise.
<p>

Grandmother? I just can't fathom how her chair slid out of that
truck! I saw Ergu tighten the ropes holdin it this morning when
we left Kentucky, and the only other person in the truck was
'cestula, and she's not bright enough to know how to cut them
ropes. Ain't that right 'cestula?

would take all night Auntie. Besides the first thing we gotta do
is find Grandmother, before she does God knows what to one of the
local boys. You know how much trouble she caused us back in Baton
Rouge".
<p>
     The middle aged woman who was now beginning to regain her
composure, patted her coifed curls gently and said. "I'm sure I
haven't the foggiest idea what you could be refferrin to Pauline,
but you are right we must find dear ol' Granny"
<p>
     Kix' brain was still workin hard trying to take all this in,
when his body gave a start, and he let out with a blood curdling
yelp. He swung round to see the grinning face of a toothless
white haired old woman, who as best he could figure out had just
goosed him with her cane.
<p>
     "Cute little fanny ya got there Sonny", said the old hag now
positively leering at Kix. "bet I could show ya some things ya
didn't even know people could do".
<p>
     Kix' brain had never been adept at changing gears either
quickly or smoothly. Now it was positively stuck in neutral.
Finally his vocal chords decided to act on their own. "What the
Hell" they exclaimed loudly, trying their best to give his brain
time to get unstuck.
<p>
     "Granny, come over here now" the black haired lady said
sternly. "you know people don't always appreciate your
attentions".
<p>
     "But he has such a" said the hag.
<p>
     "Granny! , Ergu!" said Pauline.
<p>
     Suddenly a large Arabic sort of male like (but not quite)
person had appeared, and uttering a couple of grunts, picked up
the Granny, set her back in the chair, then picked up said chair,
and put it back in the truck, retied it, and got back behind the
wheel of the lead truck.
<p>
     Kix felt some stirring in his brain, although what he was
mainly feeling was a pain in his ass. Just as his brain began to
overcome this he suddenly realized that the middle aged woman was
speaking to him.
<p>
     "Why sir thank you so much for finding Granny, she does ah
wander so". Proffering a perfumed hand she said "Crystabel
Cardwell hee-uh. Now if you don't mind we've had such a long
journey, with such an unsettlin finish, I think we'll just be
getting down to the Cardwell property, but do come to tea after
we get settled".
<p>
     With that Crystabel began to walk back to the lead truck.
<p>
     Kix' brain suddenly recovered. "Hey, wait a minute, you
can't go yet, that there woman just assaulted me" (the literal
nature of his choice in words escaped Kix).
<p>
     Crystabel turned, patted her curls and said "Ah haven't the
foggiest idea what your talkin about. Why shame on you for saying
such a thing about a poor ol' Granny". Ah am not sure-uh that you
can come to tea after all.
<p>
     "Whatya mean", Kix said, That woman assaulted me and I have
the evidence right here behind ...".
<p>
     Suddenly Kix thought better of it. What sort of humiliation
might he have to endure from his buddies? Suppose the case went
to trial. Suppose he was asked to present his evidence. He had
also heard in cases like this that medical evidence might be
needed, and what gettin that might entail made him shudder.
Besides he needed to get back to burying Slam.
<p>
     "Well okay, I guess the poor ol' dear didn't mean no harm.
How the hell old is she anyway?"
<p>
     Crystabel froze, shuddered, patted her curls, and said. "I
can see we didn't return one moment too soon! This town has lost
its civility since our family left before the whar-uh. WE are a
genteel old southern family, and no one of us would ever publicly
refer to something as sensitive to a mature lady's age. You SURH
may definitely NOT come to tea until you learn some manners! 
<p>     With that she jumped back into the lead truck, and the
profession moved on down the hill to the old Cardwell  mansion,
leaving the townsfolk with their mouths open. Poor Kix had never
had such a day as this so he just stood there for forty minutes
alternately rubbing his forehead and his behind, wondering how he
was gonna tactfully ask Flo for the right kind of ointment.
<p>
     Just before Kix recovered his wits enough to get on with
things, he noticed an old 1950's Ford convertible putting up the
pike toward town. He thought about wondering who that was, but
his battered brain said no, and he carefully got back into his
car.

<h4>About the Author</h4>
<i>     Dowdy Goodflower is an aging sociologist who first noticed
the Cardwells while doing field work during her senior year at
L.S.U.
<p>
     Convinced that she had stumbled across something unique, she
devoted her life to studying them. While somewhat bitter about
the lack of recognition her work has received in a male dominated
field, she none-the-less has continued to pursue it convinced
that her time will come.
<p>
     Her latest disappointment was when tissue samples from
various Cardwells (obtained with great difficulty) came back
stamped "Genetically Implausible" from various labs. One lab even
ask her how she had manufactured such clever fakes.
<p>
     Undaunted, she resolved to continue, and followed the family
east to Widows Peak, West Virginia in the 1952 Ford convertible
that her father had given her as a graduation gift.</i>

<a href=novels/peak.html>Peak of Passion, Pinnacle of Desire</a> 1/1</h3>
As Kix pondered funeral arrangements for his deceased brother, as Trixie
polished off the remainder of her pork rinds, and as Flo dreamed about a
combination crematorium/pizza oven/tanning booth, a strange procession
of pick-up trucks was slowly winding its weary way along the twisting
turns of a winding road on the far side of the peak in the dirction of
the Old Cardwell Mansion, abandoned for since the Civil War, when one of
the Cardwell ancestors-upset that West Virginia had seceded from
Virginia which had seceded from the Union-seceded his large and tangled
family from West Virginia and reportedly left for Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, to wait out the conclusion of the War.
<p>        Just as Kix was about to make his menu decision for his
brother's
funeral, a call came over the radio that a massive traffic jam had
ensued when a rocking chair containing an old woman had slid from the
bed of a pick-up onto the center line of the Widow's Peak Turnpike.
Traffic, wandering livestock, and a tour bus bound for the state capital
were entangled in hopeless gridlock.  Kix ran for the squad car and left
town with his tires squealing and his siren blaring. He was closely
followed by over half the townspeople who, like Kix, had never seen a
traffic jam close up and wanted in on the thrill of it. Besides, they
figured, Kix couldn't arrest them for speeding if he was in front.
